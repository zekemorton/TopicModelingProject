Altitude, Migration, and Fertility
in the Andes

Since 1948, when Monge first described
historical accounts of the low fertility of
Spanish colonists living at high altitude in
the Andes, physiologists have collected a
large body of evidence to support the contention that there is a functional relationship between hypoxia and reduced fertility.
Much of this evidence is summarized in
Monge (1948), Weihe (1964), McClung
(1969), Clegg and Harrison (1971), and
Baker and Dutt (1972). Demographers
too have shown that fertility is Inversely
related to altitude of residence (James,
1966; Heer, 1967); but at the level of
population analysis it has yet to be shown
that this reduction in fertility at high
altitude is the direct result of hypoxia.

The aim of this paper is to examine the
relationship between hypoxia and the reduced fertility of high Andean populations.

ALTITUDE AND FERTILITY

The main sources of data used in the
study of fertility in the Andean countries
have been national censuses. For Peru the
measure ‘of fertility has been the number
of children ever born, and for Ecuador and
Bolivia the child/woman ratio has been
used. Using census data for Peru, 1940,
Stycos (1963) suggested that fertility dif
ferences resulted because mating practices
differed between Indian and Spanish language speakers. Heer (1964) has also
viewed fertility differences in the Andean
countries as related to differences between
Indian and Spanish language speakers.
However, Heer suggested that the main
reasons for lower fertility among the Indian
speakers were the result of a higher proportion of women in the female labor force,
and a low adult sex ratio. The low adult
sex ratio would result in fewer females
acquiring mates. The relationship between
altitude and fertility was demonstrated by
James (1966), who found that this variable
was a more powerful explanation of differences in fertility than any other variable.
James suggested that the hypoxic effect of
high altitude resulted in reduced fertility.
When Heer (1967) reanalyzed the data,
he agreed with James that fertility depended most on altitude in Peru, but not
in Ecuador or Bolivia.

Alternative considerations have been introduced by Whitehead (1968) and Bradshaw (1969). Whitehead suggested that
the reason for lower measures of fertility
at high altitude was that infant mortality,
particularly in the rural areas, was greater.
Infant deaths would not be included in a

measure of fertility such as the child/
woman ratio. This argument is supported
by the evidence of Grahn and Kratchman
(1963) in the United States, Mazess
(1965) in Peru, and Cruz Coke et al.
(1966) in Chile. But these authors suggest
that the higher Jevel of infant mortality
is the result of hypoxia. Bradshaw (1969)
argued that in areas where fertility was
reported to be lowest the populations were
least acculturated. In these areas it would
be more likely that births would be underreported, and the number of children
underenumerated.

Since the census data used in the above
studies do not allow more detailed analysis,
De Jong (1970) and Baker and Dutt
(1972) have advocated the study of individual women in communities. The use of
reproductive life histories together with
socioeconomic and cultural data would
allow a more complete examination of
factors affecting fertility. Some studies of
this nature have been carried out. Hoff
(1968) investigated the fertility of women
living at 4,000 meters of altitude at Nuftoa
in Peru, and Cruz Coke (1967) studied
subjects living at 3,000 meters of altitude
at Huallatire, in Chile. Completed fertility
for Nufioa women was 6.7, and for Huallatire, 7.3. By world standards, the fertility
of these populations is high, but greater
reproductive performance has been measured in low altitude populations. Among
the Hutterites, completed fertility is 10.6
(Eaton and Mayer, 1953), and among an
Eskimo population, 10.5 (Milan, 1970).

Apart from the overall level of fertility,
the high Andean populations may be distinct from those at low altitude in several
aspects of reproduction. Cruz Coke (1967)
found that at Huallatire subjects were
most fertile late in their reproductive life,
in the fourth decade of life. Baker and
Dutt (1972) also note that among women
of completed fertility at Nufoa more off
Altitude, Migration, and Fertility 13

spring were born to second or subsequent
spouses than to first unions. Whether these
phenomena are related and if they result
from the effects of biological or cultural
factors is uncertain.

In the studies of Hoff (1968), Cruz Coke
(1967), and Buck et al. (1968), a very low
incidence of abortions was reported among
high Andean populations. This may simply
be the result of underreporting, or a possibility that Clegg et al. (1970) suggest is
that spontaneous abortion at high altitude
occurs too early in pregnancy to be recognized as such.

Thirdly, for Nufioa, Hoff (1968) reported a very high secondary sex ratio of
124. This was based on 608 births recorded
during a reproductive life history survey of
136 women. Using vital statistics data over
a 25-year period in the district of Nuioa,
Baker and Dutt (1972) found a secondary
sex ratio of 110.9 from 5,111 registered
births. At the present, the significance of
these findings is not clear, but this may
be another difference in the process of
reproduction at high altitude.

This brief review outlines some differences that have been reported with respect
to the reproductive performance of high
Andean populations. The interpretation of
these differences and the reasons for them
remain open to debate. Since it still remains
impossible to directly assess the potential
effect of the Andean altitudes upon the
fertility of either the upward migrant or
the native resident, we will in this study
explore a different indirect method of determining whether altitude affects the fertility
of the high altitude native.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND OBJECTIVES

Fertility may be regarded as a phenotypic characteristic of a population, and
as such fertility may be modified by the
effects of the physical environment. A
research design that would illustrate the
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

14, Abelson, Baker, and Baker

effects of a high altitude environment on
phenotypic characteristics has been constructed by Harrison (1966). In this research design, environmental effects are
illustrated by the comparison of nonmigrants resident at high and low altitudes
and with migrants between these altitudes.

A limitation of this design is that the
further variable of migration is introduced.
While the results of studies investigating
the effect of migration on fertility are by
no means uniform, sufficient data exist to
suggest that the effect of migration on
fertility should be taken into account.
Among studies in Latin America, Hutchinson (1961) and Iutaka et al. (1971) have
shown that the fertility of rural-to-urban
migrants in Brazil is greater than the
fertility of urban nonmigrants. However,
in these studies, the effect of migration is
confounded by the effect of differences in
residence background. Where the residence
background of migrants and nonmigrants
was similar, within the standard metropolitan statistical area of San Juan, Puerto
Rico, Myers and Morris (1966) and
Macisco et al. (1969) found lower fertility
among the migrants. The differences in the
results of the studies may be explained by
the effects of residence background; but at
the same time the effect of migration on
fertility remains unclear. Therefore, it is
not possible to describe the role of migration in changing rates of fertility. At the
same time, it is clear that it is necessary
to control for its possible effects.

The purpose of this study is to isolate
the effects of hypoxia on fertility, using a
research design similar to that of Harrison
(1966). The fertility rates of nonmigrants
resident at high and low altitude in the
Andes are compared, and also the fertility
of downward migrants from high to low
altitude. The effects of migration are controlled by measuring the effect of migration

Social Biology

on the fertility of migrants from one residence to another at the same altitude.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
DESIGN OF THE STUDY

Factors which may affect fertility in the
Andes include socioeconomic conditions,
cultural practices, and hypoxia. Socioeconomic conditions and cultural practices
vary both at high and low altitude; the
effects of these factors may therefore be
examined by the analysis of data collected
from nonmigrant populations. By contrast,
the effect of hypoxia will not differ among
the members of a population resident at a
particular altitude. To illustrate the effect
of this variable on fertility, it is necessary
to measure the fertility of subjects exposed
to the stress of hypoxia, and the fertility
of the same subjects, in the absence of the
stress of hypoxia. This requires that the
fertility of migrants from one altitude of
residence to another be measured.

In the Andes, there is a substantial volume of migration from high to low altitude;
thus the effect of the removal of the stress
of hypoxia can be measured. In Peru, there
is also migration from one residence at low
altitude to another at low altitude. This
affords the opportunity to control for the
effects of migration on fertility. The populations in the Andes which may therefore
be used for comparative purposes are as
follows:

A. Nonmigrants, resident at low alti
tude.

B. Nonmigrants, resident at high altitude.

C. Migrants, born at high altitude,
exposed to the risk of pregnancy,
before they migrate.

D. Migrants, born at high altitude,
exposed to the risk of pregnancy,
after migration to low altitude.

E, Migrants, born at low altitude,

Vol. 21, No. 1

exposed to the risk of pregnancy,
before they migrate.

F. Migrants, born at low altitude,
exposed to the risk of pregnancy,
after migration to another low altitude residence.

These populations may be used in diadic
comparisons to show how the hypoxic effect
of high altitude and how migration affect
fertility. These comparisons are of aggregates, and thus they also include some
effects that result from socioeconomic and
cultural effects. However, the factors that
are uncontrolled in the diadic comparisons
may be examined by considering the variation in fertility among individuals within
the populations.

The effect of altitude, including both
hypoxia and sociocultural factors, is shown
by the comparison of the nonmigrant populations (A vs. B). The effect of the removal
of the hypoxic stress is examined by comparing the fertility of the downward migrants before and after migration (C vs.
D), and with the low altitude born nonmigrants (A vs. D). The fact that the
downward migrants, before migration, were
representative of a high altitude population
with respect to fertility may be established
by comparing populations B and C.

The effect of migration on fertility is
shown by two comparisons, E with F, the
change in fertility that occurs with migration, and A with F, the effect of migration
on fertility in migrants after they have
migrated to a new area of residence.

Factors uncontrolled by the above comparisons are examined by considering
intrapopulation variation in fertility. These
include socioeconomic factors, marital
patterns, age at migration, and previous
fertility history. The extent of intrapopuJation variation may also be compared to
interpopulation variation in fertility.

SUBJECTS, SAMPLES, AND MEASURES
OF FERTILITY

The subjects of this study are residents
of the Tambo Valley, living at low altitude
in Peru. The location of the valley is 17°
05’ south of the equator, and 71° 44’ of
longitude. The population is rural, and the
economy of the valley is based on the
commercial production of sugar cane. The
majority of the population are wage earners and some 60 per cent of their food is
obtained from central markets (Riley, unpublished). The communities from which
the subjects were selected were the Cooperative of Chucarapi and the town of
Cocachacra, both in the district of Cocachacra, and from the towns of Arenal and La
Curva in the neighboring district of Dean
Valdivia. All are in the Department of
Arequipa. .

The sample was selected randomly, from
all parts of the study area, and comprises
approximately 10 per cent of the adult
females in these districts. The subjects
were of all ages, which reduces the sample
from which completed fertility can be calculated. However, a measure such as completed fertility, or children ever born, is
not a suitable measure for migrants. For
the purposes of this study, it is necessary
to distinguish between their fertility before
migration, and their fertility after migration. An advantage of the sample is that
bias due to differential mortality of women
surviving to postreproductive age is reduced. Perhaps the more serious limitation
of the sample is its size, which is too small
to take account of individual cohorts of
women.

The data used are retrospective reports
of reproductive life histories. Data were
also collected on migration, contraceptive
practice, and socioeconomic and cultural
characteristics of the subjects. From these
data it is possible to ascertain the altitude
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

16 Abelson, Baker, and Baker

of birthplace of each subject and to distinguish the reproductive experience of each
subject before and after migration. Because
of the known relationships between altitude
and oxygen transport mechanisms in man,
high altitude has been defined as above
3,000 meters; women were defined as migrants if they were born outside the Tambo
Valley. The age at migration was defined
as the age at which a subject first changed
her place of residence.

On the basis of these definitions of high
altitude and migration, the fertility of populations A, C, D, E, and F, described in
the design of the study, may be measured.
The comparisons of the fertility of these
populations and of nonmigrant high altitude populations (B), described by Hoff
(1968) and Cruz Coke (1967), fulfill the
conditions of the experimental design described. .

The measure of fertility used for comparison was the number of children born
in a five-year age interval. For a subject
to contribute an observation to any age
group she must have completed all five
years with the same migrant status. Because the ages of the subjects at the time
of migration and at the time of the survey

Social Biology

did not always coincide with the five-year
age intervals, some information had to be
discarded. However, the use of five-year
age intervals decreases the chance of misclassifying the age of the subject at the
birth of each child.

RESULTS

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF FERTILITY
CHARACTERISTICS AND MATING
PRACTICES

The total sample consisted of 241 subjects, of whom 63 were nonmigrants born
in the Tambo Valley, 57 were migrants to
the valley born at high altitude. The mean
ages of these subjects at the time of the
survey, and at vital events during their
reproductive lives, are given in Table 1.
Those born at low altitude were on the
average somewhat older than those born
at high altitude. However, with respect to
their ages at vital events during reproductive life the three groups show similar
characteristics. For the migrants, the mean
age at migration occurred near the age of
20 years. For this reason, only limited data
are available on the fertility of these subjects before migration. With respect to the
age reported for first pregnancy, the mean

values of all three populations were less
than 0.65 years apart. Age at first live birth
was calculated from the reported age of the
subject and the age of the eldest child if
living. Comparing the age at first pregnancy with age at first parturition, good
agreement is found for the nonmigrants,
and for the downward migrants. For the
migrants born at low altitude, there is some
discrepancy between these ages. Nevertheless this discrepancy is small, and the
figures lie well within the range observed
for the other two groups. This consistency
suggests that the errors in reporting ages
are small and may be Jess than two years.
The reported age at first marriage again
lies within the same range, and the standard errors for all three types of age are
also consistent. It should be noted that
formal marriage very frequently follows
rather than precedes pregnancy in this area.
For the migrants, consistency in reporting
ages at births in different locations could
be checked against their age at migration.
Less than 10 per ‘cent of these ages were
inconsistent by more than two years.
The numbers of marriages, including all

Altitude, Migration, and Fertility

 

17

socially recognized unions, show that there
is an appreciable rate of remarriage in the
populations. This follows the general pattern of serial monogamy found among
peasants in Peru. The rate of remarriage
found in the migrants is rather higher than
among the nonmigrants, but not greatly
different between these two populations.
The type of marriage in the populations
also varied according to migrant status,
but not according to altitude of birthplace.
Twenty-eight per cent of marriages among
nonmigrants were consensual, compared to
38 per cent in the migrants, both from
high and low altitude. In all three populations the proportion of consensual unions
was increased with second unions.

The children born to these unions are
described in Table 2. All subjects except
one low altitude born migrant had given
birth to at least one child. The number of
abortions reported was low, less than 7
per cent of the pregnancies in each population. The rate of abortion was particularly low for the migrants born at high
altitude, before they migrated to low altitude. After migration to low altitude these

migrants reported a greater rate of abortion
than the low altitude born nonmigrants.
Since these data were collected at one time,
this increase in abortion rate does not appear the result of differential reporting.
The downward migrants had the lowest
mean age, and therefore the difference in
reported abortions is not the result of the
older ages of these subjects at low altitude,
or of forgetting abortions that occurred
early in reproductive life.

The secondary sex ratios (SSR) deviate
from expected values of just above 100.
The value for the nonmigrants is rather
low, and the values for the downward migrants, both before and after migration,
are high. Small sample sizes prevent any
firm conclusions from being drawn. Completed fertility is reported only for the
nonmigrants, since migrants are exposed to
the risk of pregnancy in more than one
environment. The value of 8.29 for the low
altitude population is higher than values
reported for high Andean populations by
Hoff (1968) and Cruz Coke (1967).

With respect to births by order of marriage, the majority of births were ascribed
to first unions in all populations, and this
differed little between them.

CONTRACEPTION AND ABORTION

Two hundred women were asked questions about their knowledge of contraception and if they used any form of birth
control. Of these, 57 were nonmigrants,
56 were migrants born at low altitude, and
87 were migrants born at high altitude.
In general, it appears that a proportion
of the population has some knowledge of
birth control methods, but that this knowledge is limited. Of those that are aware
of these methods, only a few use them.

The mean number of offspring desired
by each of the three groups was less than
4, Less than 10 per cent of each population
thought that birth control methods should

 

Social Biology

be used to reduce the number of children
born. More than 50 per cent of those born
at low altitude stated that they had some
knowledge of these methods, compared to
less than 30 per cent of those born at high
altitude. Most of those who had heard of
birth control had heard of the pill, but
not all those who had heard of the pill

_associated it with birth control. This same

discrepancy arose when subjects were asked
if they used the pill and if they used birth
control methods. In addition, many of those
who claimed a knowledge of birth control
methods also maintained belief in folk
methods of contraception.

With respect to the practice of birth
control, the proportion of each population
claiming to apply these methods was under
16 per cent; however, only seven subjects
reported that they had used the pill for
more than three years. Abortion may be
used as a method of birth control, but the
subjects did not distinguish between deliberate and spontaneous abortion.

These data are not reliable in the sense
that an accurate assessment of the use of
birth control methods can be made; but
the lack of understanding of birth control
methods and their recent use by only a
small part of the population suggest that
these methods have not been an important
reason for differential fertility between the
subjects.

COMPARISONS BETWEEN POPULATIONS
Using the number of children born in a
five-year age interval, the fertility of the
subjects in the different populations can
be compared. Summing the rates for all age
groups in each population gives an estimate
of fertility analogous to total fertility.
From these rates of fertility (Table 3), it
is also possible to draw graphs of cumulative fertility (Figures 1 and 2). Interpolation from these figures gives estimates of
ages at each parity from which parity

intervals (Table 4) may be calculated.
The calculation of parity intervals in this
manner makes it possible to compare migrant and nonmigrant populations.

Nonmigrant populations. Table 3 shows
that for the nonmigrants of the Tambo
Valley the greatest rates of fertility occur
between the ages of 20 and 30 years. By
the age of 45, a total fertility of 8.04 is
reached. Comparison of the high and low
altitude nonmigrant populations can be
seen in Figure 1. At age 45, the fertility
of the Nufioa population is 6.0, and the
greatest slope of the curve is between the
ages of 27.5 and 35 years.

Rates of fertility were not available for
the Nunoa population, but the number of
children ever born to these subjects is compared to the low altitude born nonmigrants
and the downward migrants before migration in Figure 1. From this figure it can be
seen that the Nufioa subjects differ from
the downward migrants in the age at which
their reproductive lives begin, but that the
slopes of these curves are similar. The
slopes are determined by the rates at
which births occur, and these rates are
available for the downward migrants.
Using the rates for the downward migrants,
fertility differences are significant for the
age group 15 to 19.9 years (¢ = 2.529,

24.9 years (¢ = 2.929, p = 0.01). Compared over all three age groups using two
factor analysis of variance, the F-ratio for
the difference between the two populations
is 15.874 which is significant at better
than the 0.01 level.

From Table 4 it can be seen that the
low altitude population has shorter intervals between consecutive births. The mean
parity interval of the high altitude population, from the first to sixth birth is almost
twice that of the low altitude population.

Migrants born at low altitude: the effect
of migration. The fertility of migrants born
at low altitude, before migration, was low;
but these rates were not significantly different from those of the same age groups of
the nonmigrant population of the Tambo
Valley. This may simply be the result of
small sample size. The effect of migration
on the fertility of these migrants was to
increase their fertility, and this increase
was significant, by a ¢-test at the 0.05 level,
for the age group 15 to 19 years.

After migration, the migrants born at
low altitude showed slightly lower fertility
than the nonmigrants of the Tambo Valley,
but this difference was not significant for
any age group. There was no relationship
of the fertility of these migrants after

fertility, we see 7.69 is a little lower than
the measure of 8.04 for the nonmigrants.
This lower fertility is reflected in the comparison of the parity intervals. An earlier
start in reproductive life accounts for the

younger ages of the migrants at earlier
parities, but longer parity intervals result
in older ages at each parity for the migrants
from the fourth birth on. It would appear
that an earlier start to reproductive life
compensates for rates of reproduction that
are a little lower for the migrants.

effects of migration and the removal of the
stress of hypoxia. Before migration, the
downward migrants showed fertility rates
that were similar to those of the nonmigrant population of Nufioa. The fertility
of these subjects was greatest in the age
group 25 to 29.9 years. Comparing the
fertility of these migrants before and after
migration, the difference is significant at
the 0.01 level for the age groups 15 to 19.9

and 20 to 24.9 years. After migration, the
fertility of the downward migrants is greatest in the age group 20 to 24.9 years; at
the same time it is interesting to note that
fertility is still high in the age group 30
to 34.9 years.

Compared to the migrants born at low
altitude (Table 4 and Figure 2), the increase in fertility of the downward migrants
exceeds that of the migrants born at low

similar to the migrants born at low altitude
in that their fertility after migration was
unrelated to the number of children born
before migration, and their age at migration.

COMPARISONS WITHIN POPULATIONS

The comparisons made in the previous
section can be used to illustrate the differences in fertility that result from the effects
of hypoxia and migration. In this section
comparisons within the populations are
made in order to examine the extent to
which socioeconomic and cultural factors
and mating practices affect fertility. Characteristics of mating practices have already
been described. The differences in socioeconomic and cultural factors between the
populations at risk to pregnancy in the
Tambo Valley are described in Table 5.

From the data on the altitude of birthplace of the parents of the subjects, it can
be seen that very few of the low altitude
born subjects were of high altitude ancestry. These results are consistent with the
reports of the first language learned by
the subjects. The distribution of the sub

jects in the communities is uneven, in that
a greater proportion of low altitude born
subjects resided in Cocachacra. The communities in Dean Valdivia contained a
higher proportion of migrants, which is
related to the growth of population in this
district in recent years. In general, this
district is much poorer, with fewer urban
facilities than either Cocachacra or Chucarapi.

The literacy and education of the subjects show that those born at low altitude
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

Vol. 21, No. 1

received more education than those born at
high altitude. Nonmigrants were better
educated than migrants born at low altitude. Again these factors are correlated
with the language first learned by the
subject.

With respect to the occupation of the
subject, most were not employed. Of those
that were employed, there was a higher
proportion of migrants than nonmigrants;
considering the type of employment, a
higher proportion of subjects born at high
altitude were employed in manual work
compared to subjects born at low altitude.

With respect to the characteristics of
the migrants before migration, both exposure to different elements of culture at high
and low altitude, and the degree of exposure to urban or rural environments, may
be relevant to their fertility after migration. Concerning their previous residence
background, the proportions of each group
of migrants born in towns of over 10,000
population were close to 40 per cent.

The relationships between these socioeconomic and cultural factors and fertility
were examined using simple correlation,
and multiple correlation and regression
analysis. No significant relationships were
discovered. At the same time, considering
all age groups, the fertility of the downward migrants living in the Tambo Valley
was found to be significantly greater, at
the 0.5 level, than the fertility of the low
altitude born subjects, migrant and nonmigrant, living in the valley.

Summarizing these results, it can be said
that the differences in fertility between
these rural populations living at different
altitudes in the Andes are greater than the
differences in fertility of the populations
living at the same altitude. Secondly, the
downward migrants, who showed the lowest
rates of fertility prior to migration while
living at high altitude, were the most

fertile subjects among those living at low
altitude.

DISCUSSION

The data used in this study were retrospective reports of reproductive life histories. Data of this nature are subject to
error in all societies, and errors in the data
were detected in this study. However, the
errors discovered would not account for the
differences reported for high and low
Andean populations. Although no absolute
check could be made on the numbers of
children reported, there was no obvious
underreporting by those of lower social
class, migrant status, or by altitude of
birthplace. For the subjects of this study,
differential reporting of births at high and
low altitude is not a cause of differences in
the numbers of births reported, because all
data were collected from the subjects at
one interview.

A second potential source of error exists
in the accuracy of the reported ages of
the subjects at vital events during reproductive life. Here there was reasonable
correspondence between the age reported
for first pregnancy, the age estimated for
the subject at first live birth, and age at
first marriage. Some discrepancy was found
for the migrants born at low altitude, but
this was small. In general, the reported
ages were estimated to be accurate to
within two years. For the migrants this
was confirmed by comparing ages at migration with the ages of the subjects at the
birth of children born before and after
migration. These errors are also of the same
order found by Morris (1969) in a study
of a similar nature in the Department of
Lima, Peru. Again, those born at high
altitude were no less accurate than the
low altitude born subjects.

The reproductive life cycle of those
living at high and low altitude, and of
migrants and nonmigrants, in the Andes,

 

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

24: Abelson, Baker, and Baker

follow similar courses. The age at menarche
is later among those living at high altitude
(Sobrevilla, 1967; Cruz Coke, 1967; Frisancho and Baker, 1970), but this does not
appear to affect age at first pregnancy or
age at first marriage. The mean age at
first pregnancy for the Tambo Valley nonmigrants was 19.77 years, compared to
20.00 years for the low altitude population
of Arica, Chile (Cruz Coke, 1967). In this
study, those born at high altitude showed
a later mean age of first pregnancy than
those born at low altitude, but for the high
altitude population of Nufioa, Hoff (1968)
found that the mean age of first pregnancy
was 19.7 years. At Huallatire, this mean
age was younger than for Arica (Cruz
Coke, 1967).

The data on ages at first pregnancy and
first marriage indicate that a subject is
often at risk to pregnancy before a union
is recognized. For this reason it is not possible to define the time at which a woman
is at risk to pregnancy by the time when
she is married. Since the pattern of marriage in Peru is one of serial monogamy
and many of the population remarry, there
is some doubt as to when a woman is at
risk to pregnancy during the course of her
reproductive life. In this study, all but one
of the births were ascribed to a union, but
this does not mean that all were conceived
after the formal recognition of the union.

The rates of remarriage and of consensual unions among the subjects of this
study were greater for the migrants than
for the nonmigrants. The highest rate of
remarriage was observed among low altitude born migrants; but this may simply
reflect the fact that the mean age of this
population was older than that of the migrants born at high altitude. However, the
rates of remarriage and of consensual union
do not appear to be related to fertility.
Migrants born at high altitude were more
fertile than nonmigrants, while the low

Social Biology

altitude born migrants were slightly less
fertile.

Turning to differences in fertility between populations living at high and low
altitude, the Tambo Valley nonmigrants
provide data on the fertility of a low
altitude rural Peruvian population. Their
completed fertility was 8.29. This estimate
is based on a small sample, but agrees
quite well with the estimate of 8.04 for
their total fertility which was derived from
a larger quantity of data. They are more
fertile than the populations of Nufioa and
Huallatire where completed fertilities were
6.7 and 7.3 respectively. The number of
abortions for the Tambo Valley nonmigrants were fewer than the 17 to 30 per
cent of all pregnancies that Cruz Coke
(1967) found for Arica, but higher than
the number reported for Huallatire.

Migrants born at low altitude showed
low rates of fertility before migration.
However, data were only available for the
age groups 15 to 19.9 and 20 to 24.9 years.
After migration, the fertility of the low
altitude born migrants was slightly but not
significantly lower than the nonmigrants.
Among these migrants, fertility increased
with migration, but not to a level greater
than the nonmigrants. These results are
consistent with those of Myers and Morris
(1966) and Macisco et al. (1969). In the
same environment, migrants may be less
fertile than nonmigrants. At the same time,
as Myers (1972) showed, the fertility of
migrants increases with migration.

Migrants born at high altitude also
showed an increase in fertility with migration. However, before migration, the fertility of the downward migrants was similar
to that of the nonmigrant population of
Nufioa. The fertility of these migrants increased not only to a level greater than
that of high altitude populations, but also
to a Jevel greater than that of low altitude
born populations. After migration, these

 
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

 

Vol. 21, No. 1

migrants showed the highest rates of fertility for the ages between 20 and 30 years.
Also, after migration the downward migrants reported abortions in almost the
same frequency as the low altitude born
populations, but the SSR among their offspring remained high.

Considering the changes in the fertility
of the migrants, it is possible to evaluate
some of the factors that have been proposed
to affect fertility in the Andes. These factors include socioeconomic and cultural
factors and the effects of the physical
environment. Although migration is a further variable that may affect fertility, the
results of this study do not suggest that
this factor is important in itself. Before
migration, the downward migrants showed
fertility rates typical of a high Andean
population. Migrants, from one residence
to another in the same environment, did
not differ significantly in their fertility
after migration from nonmigrants. However, migration from high to low altitude is
also accompanied by changes in the sociocultural and physical environment.

Differences in marital patterns and socioeconomic status do not appear to account
for the differences in fertility between the
populations of this study. In aggregate,
migrants had higher rates of remarriage
and consensual unions, but downward migrants living in the Tambo Valley were
more fertile than nonmigrants born at low
altitude. Low altitude born migrants, after
migration, were not. Nor were any significant relationships found between fertility and these factors in the regression
analysis.

Concerning the socioeconomic status of
the downward migrants, this was lower
than that of the low altitude born nonmigrants both before and after migration;
yet before migration the downward migrants were the least fertile population
of all. After migration they were the most

Altitude, Migration, and Fertility

25

fertile. Thus, while socioeconomic conditions may change on migration from high
to low altitude, the changes in these conditions do not appear a major factor in
the changes in fertility.

Another factor accompanying migration
from high to low altitude is acculturation.
However, Mejia (1963) reported that
downward migrants in Peru are poorly
acculturated, and that they are poorly
integrated into the communities to which
they migrate. In addition, Morris (1969)
failed to show any consistent relationship
between his index of acculturation and
fertility.

Two other factors that were suggested
as possible explanations of reduced fertility at high altitude in the Andes were the
greater number of women in the female
labor force and the adult sex ratio (Heer,
1964, 1967). Both of these factors are of
course correlated with altitude. Women
among the downward migrants who participated in the labor force did not show
reduced fertility. Concerning the adult sex
ratio, this is low in areas of emigration,
and high in areas of immigration. In the
Andes most migration is from high to low
altitude.

The results of this study are consistent
with the hypothesis that hypoxia acts to
reduce fertility. This is supported by the
fact that changes in fertility occurred as
soon as migration from high to low altitude
occurred and did not appear to be related
to previous fertility experience. In studies
where sociocultural factors have been the
main factors influencing fertility in migrants, some time has elapsed before
changes were seen in the fertility of the
migrants (Goldberg, 1959; Iutaka et al.,
1971). With respect to the reproductive
performance of the downward migrants,
the change in the number of abortions reported may be further evidence that
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:34 08 December 2015

26 Abelson, Baker, and Baker

hypoxia acts directly on the fertility of
the migrants.

Finally, the SSR of the offspring born
to downward migrants may be a factor
distinguishing these subjects. High SSRs
have been reported for high Andean populations. This was found for the downward
migrants, not only before migration, but
also after migration. The significance of
this observation is not clear, and similar
findings have not been reported for other
high altitude populations,

SUMMARY

In this study, a population comparison
technique was applied to assess the effect
of altitude on fertility. The effect of the
removal of the stress of hypoxia has been
illustrated by the comparison of the reproductive performance of nonmigrants
resident at high and low altitudes, and of
migrants to low altitude from birthplaces
at both high and low altitude.

The data used were retrospective reports
of reproductive life histories. While these
data are not precise, they may be used to
compare the fertility of populations, using
the number of children born in a five-year
age interval as a measure of fertility. The
accuracy of the responses to the questionnaires is described, and it was found that
those born at high altitude were no less
accurate in their replies than those born
at low altitude.

The reproductive life cycles of the migrants and the nonmigrants, and of those
born at high and low altitude were similar;
but the migrants showed higher rates of
remarriage and consensual unions. Rate of
remarriage and type of union were not
related to differential fertility between the
populations.

The low altitude born nonmigrant popu
Social Biology

lation showed high fertility, typical of a
peasant population that does not practice
contraception. Their total fertility was
8.04, and their highest rates of fertility
were in the third decade of life. Migrants
born at low altitude showed low fertility
rates prior to migration. After migration,
the fertility rates of these migrants were
slightly but not significantly lower than the
rates of the low altitude born nonmigrants.

Before migration, the downward migrants showed fertility rates similar to the
high altitude population of Nufoa. At this
stage of their lives they reported few abortions. After migration to low altitude these
migrants reported rates of fertility slightly
higher than the nonmigrants of the Tambo
Valley, and approximately the same frequency of abortions.

Several possible explanations which
might account for the increase in fertility
of the downward migrants on migration
from high to low altitude were considered.
These included migration, socioeconomic
factors, acculturation, seasonal male emigration from high altitude, and the removal
of the stress of hypoxia. Of these factors,
altitude appears to be the most significant.
