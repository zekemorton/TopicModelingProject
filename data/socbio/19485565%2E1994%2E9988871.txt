ABSTRACT: There are few studies of the interrelationships among breastfeeding, child spacing, and child mortality in traditional societies that incorporate extensive controls for social and demographic characteristics of the mother and child. In this paper, we investigate the impact of breastfeeding and the length of the preceding birth interval on early child mortality (defined as a death in the first two years of life) using data from a traditional society of India. Multivariate hazards models are used to analyze the data. Most prior analyses related the impact of breastfeeding duration to the duration of child survivability by taking breastfeeding as a fixed covariate. The present study has a methodological focus in the sense that breastfeeding information from retrospective survey data is treated as a time-dependent covariate both as a status variate as well as a duration--with empirical findings compared across the two specifications. The effects of postpartum amenorrhoea and various other demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of mother and child are also studied. The results suggest that breastfeeding duration has a strong impact in reducing the relative risk of early child mortality; but it does not explain the effect of the length of the preceding birth interval on early child mortality.

Both high infant mortality and high fertility rates are major concerns for policy makers in developing countries like India, Nepal, and Bangladesh. Breastfeeding and birth spacing are closely interrelated with each to some extent, affecting the other. The study of the effects of both breastfeeding and birth spacing on child mortality has long been plagued by problems of spuriousness and simultaneity (Millman, 1985; Millman and Palloni, 1984; Palloni and Tienda, 1986).
Most review articles on studies of the link between breastfeeding and child health and survival provide convincing evidence of the health benefits of breastfeeding (Feachem and Koblinski, 1984; Jason et al., 1984; Anderson et al., 1984; WHO, 1989). It also is now well established that short intervals between births are detrimental to

the health of both the mother and of the children born at both ends of the interval. Both pregnancy and lactation require supplementation of the mother's normal diet, and a short birth interval does not give sufficient time for the mother to recuperate from the birth and to replenish her stores of nutrients used during pregnancy. Repetitive short cycles of pregnancy and lactation lead to progressively higher risks of low-birth-weight babies who have lower chances of survival in the early years. In addition, births spaced too quickly pose constraints for the mother in caring for and rearing the children.
The pernicious effects of rapid childbearing on child-survival chances have been the subject of research for at least seventy years. Indeed, 1923 saw the publication of two of the earliest known studies in the area (Stevenson,

1923; Hughes, 1923). A complicating factor is that the interaction between lactation, child mortality, and fertility varies not only from country to country but also from one segment of the population to another within the same country (Hobcraft et al., 1983, 1984; Lantz et al., 1992; Miller et al., 1992; Palloni and Millman, 1986; Retherford et al., 1989; Rustin, 1983). We do not have adequate information on this interaction in different situations. Further, the causal relationship among breastfeeding, birth spacing, and child mortality becomes complicated in the presence of a number of other explanatory variables like age of mother, sex of the child, birth order, and socioeconomic status. Some prior studies are limited by treating the duration of breastfeeding as either a categorical or a current status covariate. This treatment may affect the empirical results obtained. More research efforts are needed to isolate the role of breastfeeding from the other confounding factors as well as to overcome these methodological limitations.
In the present paper, the relationships of early child mortality, defined as a death in the first two years of life, to the pace of childbearing and breastfeeding are studied through multivariate hazards modelling in a traditional Indian Society. Breastfeeding is universal and lengthy in India, especially in rural areas. Aside from its contraceptive effect, breastfeeding provides protection against malnutrition and infectious diseases that is very important for child survival, especially in rural areas where access to modern medical facilities is quite limited. Breastfeeding provides protection against morbidity and mortality, especially during the

first year of life (Habicht, et al., 1986; Cunningham, 1988); even partial breastfeeding has been found to be beneficial (Habicht et al., 1988). However, relatively few rigorous studies of all three variables--birth spacing, breastfeeding, and child survivability --simultaneously and in the presence of controls for other variables have been done in contemporary India.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
DATA AND ITS CHARACTERISTICS
Data for the research presented here come from the retrospective survey, "A Study on Effects of SocioEconomic Factors on Fertility among Scheduled Caste Population in the Rural Areas of Karimganj District, Assam" conducted during 1988-89 (the reference date for survey questions was June 15, 1988) under the auspices of University Grants Commission (UGC), New Delhi.
The survey was confined to only the scheduled caste population--the backward and economically deprived class of the Indian population. They are in the lowest class of Hindu society--a caste system of social organization found in old India and continuing to the present day. Membership in a caste is hereditary and is fixed for life. A couple was defined as eligible for the present study if both the partners were alive on the reference date of the survey and the age of the female spouse was less than 50 years. Information on the status of the women--menstruating, pregnant, amenorrheic, or menopausal--on the reference date was obtained, and those who had reached menopause were excluded.

The Karimganj district of Southern Assam is predominantly a Bengalispeaking area, where a large number of villages are identified as scheduled caste villages. If at least 10 per cent of the village population belongs to the scheduled castes, the village is considered to be a scheduled caste village by the Directorate of Economics and Statistics, Assam. From the list of scheduled caste villages of the district, a sample of 39 villages was selected by simple random sampling. Then, all scheduled caste households were enumerated. The survey comprises 1,805 scheduled caste households from the selected villages.
The objectives of this survey were to obtain reliable data relating to fertility, to study the socioeconomic and behavioral factors affecting fertility, and to estimate biocultural parameters of human reproduction in traditional societies. In addition to other information, data were collected on age at marriage, total number of children ever born and surviving, including details about duration variables--lactation, postpartum amenorrhea (PPA), timing of birth, timing of child death, etc.--for all births occurring within the last seven years for each married, eligible female in the household.
Life history events were dated to the year and month through the use of a calendar of local events, such as notable ceremonies like Annaprasan (introduction of rice as solid food for the first time), festivals like Durga Puja, Holi, Dipavali, Makar Sankranti, severe drought, eclipse, and administrative or political events. The limitations of retrospective information based upon mother's recollections to provide reliable information on duration of

breastfeeding and life history events must be acknowledged and interpretations of substantive results of the analyses reported below suitably qualified. Nonetheless, short of prospective panel data (which are nonexistent for traditional Assam populations), this method is the only manner such information can be obtained. To address the substantive questions raised in the introduction to this paper, we report analyses of this unique set of data.
Only those eligible couples who did not practice any method of family planning to space and limit birth and for which husband and wife were normal residents of the village were considered. As the survey was restricted to the scheduled caste population, a grouping of subcastes was done for the present analysis, each group having its own distinct social organization and culture. Educational attainment among these groups of people is very low, and most of them are still engaged in traditional occupations like agriculture, fishing, cloth washing, hair cutting, cane works, pot-making, and basket-making. Only a small number of persons were employed in government or nontraditional private sector jobs.
In the present analysis, the impacts of eight independent variables on the duration of child survival up to the age of 24 months are examined. These covariates are (/) mother's age the birth of a child, (ii) length of preceding birth interval, (Hi)parity of mother, (iv) sex of child, (v) mother's education, (vi) subcaste, (vii) PPA, and (viii) breastfeeding. A woman's age at the birth of a child is known to be an important determinant in analyzing the risk of infant death. To investigate the effect of

age, mothers were categorized according to their age at the birth of a child as: (/) < 25 years, (//) 25-35 years, and (///) 35-43 years. The length of the preceding birth intervals were defined as (/) <15 months, (//) 15-27 months, and (///) > 27 months. Mothers were categorized according to level of education as (i) those who had no schooling or elementary schooling (1-5 years of schooling), and («) middle schooling and beyond (6 or more years of schooling). In countries such as India, where a preference for male children exists, it is believed that breastfeeding patterns depend on the infant's sex. Thus, we examine the roles of both mother's age and child's sex on the interval of interest.
ANALYTICAL METHODS
A major problem in using interval data (e.g., birth intervals, duration of child survival, duration of breastfeeding, etc.) from a retrospective survey is the incompleteness of the maternity histories of the women, except for the oldest cohort. The incompleteness generally creates two types of problems, viz., censoring and selectivity, which are difficult to tackle both statistically and substantially. Censoring occurs when intervals are interrupted by the interview itself. Open intervals are biased toward long intervals, and closed intervals are biased toward short intervals. The problem of censoring can be handled through the application of life table techniques (Namboodiri and Suchindran, 1989) or the incorporation of the life table approach into a multivariate procedure (Cox, 1972). The selectivity problem is that the intervals available for analysis may be only a selected subset of the uni-

verse of interest. While it may at first seem natural to analyze all the intervals reported by retrospective histories, to do so biases the analysis toward younger ages at initiation, toward the experience of older birth cohorts, and toward the experience of most recent time periods.
The selection bias in demographic studies arising from retrospective surveys has been addressed by several authors (Rodriguez and Hobcraft, 1980; Rindfuss et al., 1982; Vaupel and Yashin, 1985; Heckman and Walker, 1990; Rogers, 1992). Rindfuss et al. (1982) suggested a method to overcome selectivity bias while analyzing interval data from a retrospective survey. Following the guidelines of Rindfuss et al., we have selected a subset of the available set of retrospective data for analysis--that which is bounded by current (at survey date) ages 12 and 43 and which occurred in the six years ending a year before survey as indicated (shaded area) in the Lexis diagram shown in Figure 1.
For the present study, the duration of child survival is measured by the interval between date of birth and time of death if it occurs on or before 24 months, which is an uncensored observation. No account is taken of multiple births. Censored observations may occur in two ways: (/) if a child survives at least 24 months prior to reference date of survey, and (ii) if the interval between birth and the reference date of survey is less than 24 months and the child survives up to the reference date. In the following models, the probability of death depends on the duration of child survival and on a set of independent variables which describe characteristics of the mother and

sion coefficients to be estimated. The breastfeeding variables were examined in two separate specifications in order to ease interpretational difficulties of time-dependent covariates and to reduce computer costs.
The first model specifies the hazard for child mortality up to t months as follows:

/; z) =

+ (2)

where I(t) is an indicator variable assuming a value 1 if the mother is breastfeeding t months after birth of the child and 0 if she is not breastfeeding. The p2and P3 are unknown regression coefficients. Note that the indicator variable I(t) simply examines whether or not breastfeeding status (current status) influences the risk of death at failure time. Also, by interacting a particular independent variable and I(t) variable, one can examine the question of whether the effect of current breastfeeding status on the rate of death varies among subgroups of the population defined by the variable. However, such a categorical specification of breastfeeding does not account for effects of the duration of breastfeeding if it has stopped prior to the time point at which the hazard is estimated. To include the duration of breastfeeding, the following specification of the model was used:

h(t; z) =

(3)

where BD(t) = minimum (t, duration of breastfeeding). Note that for mothers who have stopped breastfeeding before t, BD(t) will be the duration of breastfeeding, and for those still continuing breastfeeding, BD(t) will be the time point of consideration. Again, limitations of these definitions must be

acknowledged. For instance, the retrospective survey data available to us do not permit distinctions between full and partial (supplemented) breastfeeding.
The hazard functions in Models I, II, and III allow estimation of relative risks of other groups in relation to specific baseline groups by the exponent of the regression coefficient exp(-). Each element of the coefficients exp(.) represents the effect of covariates on the hazards function for a given group as compared to the reference group. When covariates are present, the exp(.) term reduces to unity. Values greater than unity indicates the relative risk of giving birth is greater for this group, compared with the reference group, whereas values less than unity indicate a decrease in the risk.
RESULTS
This analysis is based on 4,020 censored and 618 uncensored observations. Results under six different specifications--by excluding and including some of the variables involved --of hazards modelling are presented in Tables 1, 2, and 3. Model estimates under these different specifications are exhibited so that empirical results may be compared and studied for trends and robustness.
Model I in Table 1 estimates the effects of preceding birth intervals and different sociocultural and biological variables excluding breastfeeding and PPA. The results indicate that preceding birth intervals of length s 2 7 months, parity of mother, sex of child, mother's education, and subcaste have significant effects on early child mortality.

Model II expands on Model I by introducing PPA into the model. The objective is to see whether the estimates in Model I will change if this control factor is included. It is observed that with the introduction of PPA as control variable, the effect of parity of mother and "other subcastes" become insignificant, but age of mother attains statistical significance.
Models III and IV in Table 2 expand on Model I by including the key factor of breastfeeding as a status- and as a duration-variable respectively. The effects of biological covariates, save age of mother, and of sociocultural factors

are attenuated following the inclusion of breastfeeding as a control variable. When breastfeeding is included as a duration variable, the effects of both categorical values of the length of the preceding birth interval (15-27 months and s 27 months) reach significance and the effect of one of the categories for age of mother becomes insignificant. Finally, Models V and VI in Table 3 further expand on Models III and IV by introducing PPA. Inclusion of PPA as a control variable reduces the strength of the breastfeeding variable observed in Models III and IV; but the patterns of association remain

unaltered for the other covariates under study.
It appears that estimates of regression coefficients provided by the multivariate hazards model, where both PPA and breastfeeding are considered under the same setup, show excellent and meaningful results (see Table 3). In Table 3, under Model VI, we find variations in mortality among children with the specified birth intervals are statistically significant. Babies born to mothers who do not have sufficient re-

covery times following a birth before next pregnancy have lower survival chances. Children born between 15-27 months and on or after 27 months from the preceding birth are 25 per cent and 72 per cent less likely respectively, to die in the first 24 months of their lives as compared to children born after less than 15 months from the preceding birth.
The risk of death for children relative to mother's age at the birth is higher for mother's age less than 25

years and lower for mother's age between 25 and 35 years compared to mother's age of 35 years or more. When all other covariates are" controlled, higher parity children are more likely to die within the first 24 months of their lives. For every increase in parity, the risk of death is increased by 1.085 times (Model I). But when PPA or/and breastfeeding are considered in the model specification (Models II to

VI), the effects of parity become insignificant. The relative risk of death of a male child as compared to female child is approximately 0.4.
With regards to mother's education, the results follow the expected direction. Mother's education has direct influences on both child care and living standard, and thus it is a good indicator of child life circumstances. The results indicate that education is negatively

Vol. 41, No. 3-4

related to early child mortality. Children belonging to the illiterate/ nominal education group of mothers have significantly higher (1.327 times in Model VI) hazards of death than those born to educated mothers. Significant variation in the early child mortality rate also is observed among different subcaste groups. The relative rates of early child mortality are low for children belonging to both Kaibarta and other subcastes as compared to the Namasudra subcaste. For every additional month of PPA duration of a mother, the risk of death of a child is decreased by 2 to 7.34 per cent under three different model specifications.
After controlling for sociocultural and demographic factors, breastfeeding has a strong significant influence on the risk of child death. The estimated regression coefficients for breastfeeding show that at any given point, the risk of early childhood mortality is reduced by 75 (39) per cent under Model
III (V) if the mother is breastfeeding at that time, compared to the risk among women not breastfeeding at that time.
Results from the model specifying breastfeeding duration with selected sociocultural and demographic factors appear in Tables 2 (Model IV) and 3 (Model VI). Results from these models show breastfeeding duration has highly significant negative effects on the rate of early child mortality--about a 6.5 (5.6) per cent reduction under Model
IV (VI) for every additional month of breastfeeding. Thus, under Model VI, if a child is breastfed for six months, the relative risk of dying in the first 24 months of life is 0.71 (exp[-0.0560x 6]) compared to a child who is never breastfed. Further, it is estimated and found that the interactions of breast-

feeding status/durations and other covariates are not statistically significant (not shown in the table).
DISCUSSION
Breastfeeding practices in traditional Indian Society are consistent with child rearing practices in most traditional societies in which breastfeeding is seen not only as a way of delaying the next birth but also as a cheap source of nutrition for the survival of the child. In rural areas of India, women continue to breastfeed their children exclusively for up to eight months and in some cases even for twelve months (Khan, 1990). Nath et al. (1993) reported that the life table median duration of breastfeeding of the Assam survey is 16 months. Demand feeding is the rule, and infants are fed between eight to fourteen times during 24 hours of a day in poor segments of the population of India (WHO, 1981). With demand feeding the rule, it is extremely difficult to collect information on the impact of supplementary feeding on the frequency or the duration of suckling. In particular, the data analyzed here do not provide any information to differentiate between full and partial breastfeeding.
One obvious mechanism causing poor survival chances--which cannot be fully dealt with in the present study because of data limitations--is the maternal health depletion syndrome. A mother with repeated pregnancies and especially short birth intervals does not have sufficient time for recovery, both physically and nutritionally, and is more likely to have low-birth-weight babies. There is much evidence that

178

Nath et al.

low-birth-weight babies have poor survival chances, even into early childhood. Thus, the preceding birth interval often shows up as a significant determinant of early child mortality. This is the case in the results reported above--which indicate that there is a negative relationship between the length of time between the birth of the index child and the preceding birth and early child mortality, so that the longer the interval, the lower the risk of child death. In this traditional society, we find that children born to mothers following birth intervals of less than 15 months have higher risks of death during early childhood--a finding that survives and even grows stronger when controls for PPA and breastfeeding, especially breastfeeding duration, are introduced into the hazards models. Children born to the youngest ( < 25 years) birth cohort mothers also are more susceptible to death within first two years of their lives.
As long as the child is on the breast, it receives assured nourishment independent of the socioeconomic status of the family. But when the child is weaned, its health depends on nourishment apart from breastmilk, and the availability and quality of such nourishment is influenced by the socioeconomic status of the family. Mother's education represents household socioeconomic status in the present study. As expected, children born to illiterate or nominally educated women have higher risks of death. Mother's education shows up as a strong predictor of early child mortality. Indian society also is known for its preference for sons. The estimated lower risk of male deaths measures this sex bias against the female child. Birth order also has

substantial effects on early child mortality before the introduction of breastfeeding as an explanatory variable.
Examination of the relationship between breastfeeding and duration of child survivability needs special techniques because a child can change from a breastfeeding status to nonbreastfeeding status during the survivability interval of a survey. Previous investigations of the impact of breastfeeding on child mortality have related duration of survivability to breastfeeding as a categorical variable. However, since in such specifications, breastfeeding may be longer than the duration of child survival, estimates of the effects of breastfeeding in these studies may be biased. We deal with this problem using the only calculable values available in this survey of traditional Indian society--through a specification of hazard regression models in which breastfeeding is constructed in a timedependent setting.
Our results show that breastfeeding, whether measured as a current status covariate or as a duration variable, consistently reduces the risk of early child mortality--even in the presence of controls for several other demographic and socioeconomic status variables. This finding appears to contradict the results of Palloni and Millman's (1986) study of data from 12 Latin American countries in which breastfeeding did little to explain child survivability. But it is consistent with findings from Miller et al.'s (1992) study of data from Bangladesh and the Philippines and Retherford et al.'s (1989) findings based on Nepal World Fertility Data. They also concluded that breastfeeding has important effects in reducing early child mortality
