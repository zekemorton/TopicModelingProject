ABSTRACT: The relationship between fertility of parents and children has been designated as "weak" by most investigators. This paper reviews the evidence over the past century and argues that, even allowing for problems with available data sources, the relationship was probably close to zero for pre-transitional populations. However, over time, the relationship has tended to become more substantial and is now of a similar order of magnitude in developed countries as other widely used explanatory variables. Possible mechanisms for the observed relationship are discussed, especially the roles of socialization and inherited factors. The types of data used are compared to the scientific questions posed, and the limitations of the common comparison of married-mother/married-daughter pairs are considered. Finally, some evidence from recent large-scale surveys in Britain and the United States is presented to show changes over recent periods and the relative effects of sibship size of fathers and mothers.

The association of fertility between parents and their children has been a subject of continuing scientific interest for a century. Pearson et al. (1899)' investigated the extent of fertility correlations among branches of the British upper classes, largely arising from Pearson's interest in its effect on population biology. Pearson (p. 260) pointed out that "intellectual and emotional characters [that are] . . . ultimately a result of physical conformation . . . will be inherited according to the same law as that which holds for physically measurable organs." He argued

that fertility and fecundity are part of the former group. However, the possibility that preferences for a particular number of children in a given environment may be similarly transmitted is also examined in this review. Pearson considered the number of children of different dyads, including father-son, mother-daughter, and paternal grandmother-granddaughter pairs, although they note that for the older generation the term "parent" is equally suitable. As might be anticipated, Pearson product moment correlation coefficients are the most common form of summary measure used, and they remain so today.2

1This paper is comprised of three parts with different authors. The first part, pages 258 to 278, by Pearson is a theoretical discussion of the measurement of heritable factors; the second by Pearson and Lee, pages 279 to 290 and 316 to 323, is concerned with the heritability of human fertility; and the third by Pearson with the assistance of Bramley-Moore, pages 290 to 315 and 324 to 330, deals with inherited fecundability by thoroughbred mares. The biological emphasis is therefore apparent.

2Values were calculated for "weighted" and "unweighted" cases. In the former case with a family containing n children, each mother will be included n times, as compared to the latter case where each mother appears only once. Studies which use random samples of parents as the unit of analysis (i.e., collect information about number of own sibs and of children) use the

Pearson and Lee (p. 277) were careful to distinguish between intergenerational correlations that could arise because of transmission of fertility between parents and children and spurious ones due to the mixing of heterogeneous populations. Subsequently, investigations have attempted to control for such heterogeneity, for example, by breaking general populations into more homogenous units or confining analysis to particular sub-populations. However, multivariate analysis is increasingly the method of choice for implementing such controls.
PRE-TWENTIETH-CENTURY POPULATIONS
Among the relationships and groups studied (Figure 1), Pearson et al. found a maximum correlation coefficient of 0.2130 between the fertility of 1,000 mother-daughter pairs from the peerage and baronetage, both of whom had marriages that had lasted for at least 15 years. The standard errors are based on the assumption of independent random samples which will underestimate values in some cases. The lowest reported correlation coefficient between female pairs was 0.0418 for 4,418 pairs from a mixture of upperclass groups with the only restriction that
latter approach, whereas designs such as record linkage that collect information on all children in families (i.e., collect information about number of parent's sibs and own sibs) may use the former approach. Some studies collect information from children on their parents' number of sibs, but this cannot provide information on those members of the older generation who remain childless. Simulation shows that the correlation coefficients for fertility of successive generations computed from these two designs are very similar in practice, although Pearson and Lee's study shows different values for unclear reasons. If the sample design involves collection of data from siblings, the nonindependence of the responses would mean that the standard errors would be greater than for a random sample.

the daughter should have been married for 15 years or her spouse had died before 15 years. These data were weighted, and the possibility of excluding some infant deaths was acknowledged. Pearson attributed the low value in part to the particular characteristics of this population. Although heterogeneity would usually be expected to inflate correlations, Pearson and Lee argued that the female landed gentry were often heiresses, who in a system of largely impartible inheritance were more likely to have come from smaller families.
Father/son analysis was based on 1,000 pairs. The male figure for the peerage corresponding to the female value of 0.2130 above was 0.0656 (but no restriction was placed on the length of the fathers' marriage), and the figure for landed gentry was higher at 0.1161, but included a restriction that the father's marriage should also have lasted for 15 years.
Essentially the same male data used by Pearson and Lee were reanalyzed by Williams and Williams (1974) with almost identical numerical results, but with a different interpretation. Pearson and Lee implicitly assume a population who make no deliberate attempt to limit fertility, although they do note this possibility as a factor which would tend to depress correlations (p. 279). A consequence of this natural fertility assumption is that there is assumed to be little, if any, correlation between the fertility of fathers and sons, since the only male mechanism considered is inherited male subfecundity. Pearson and Lee interpret the fact that the correlation between fertility of fathers and sons is higher if the analysis is restricted to marriages of more than 15 years duration as evidence of the "exhaustion" of male fertility (p. 288).

Fio. 1.--Intergenerational fertility correlation coefficients from Pearson et al. (1899).

A number of studies of more recent populations have subsequently taken place, but studies of general pre-transitional historical populations have been more rare. Langford and Wilson (1985) used 10,931 evermarried mother-daughter pairs (with the daughter as the unit of analysis so mothers could be included more than once), from reconstitution data from the Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Social Structure over the period between the mid-sixteenth to mid-nineteenth centuries. They concluded that there was no association between the fecundity of mothers and daughters. Although they computed a small but nominally statistically significant correlation coefficient of 0.0206, their chi-square test showed no statistically significant relationship and their small correlation coeffi-

cient was heavily influenced by a positive relationship in a single parish of the 14 parishes included.
These data, however, are inevitably subject to considerable error. Langford and Wilson draw attention to the fact that 35 per cent of second-generation married women were recorded as childless as evidence of this error factor. Fewer than 10 per cent of these records had complete information on both mothers and daughters, but when these 939 complete records were used, the correlation coefficient increased only slightly to 0.0330, and the value was not statistically significant. Moreover, the value of the correlation coefficient is more than halved if the outlier parish of Earsdon in Northumberland is removed.

To the extent that the populations from different parishes are heterogeneous, combining them might be expected to generate a positive correlation coefficient. However, of the 14 individual parishes, 6 actually have negative, albeit small, values for the correlation coefficient of fertility of mothers and daughters. In contrast, there is a correlation coefficient of 0.0968 between the ages of marriage of mothers and daughters in the overall sample, although essentially none with time spent in the married state before age 50. Since there is a positive relationship between family size and early age at marriage, and between the ages at marriage of mothers and daughters, some association between fertility of mothers and married daughters would be expected, although this would be reduced because of the lack of relationship with duration of exposure. These data cannot show whether women from large families were less likely to marry, only that those who did so married earlier on average.
This finding of a positive link between ages of marriage in successive generations was partially replicated in Levine's (1982) analysis of the village of Shepshed in Leicestershire. He looked at parent/child correlations in age at marriage and found that for those married between ages 18 to 30, ages chosen to reduce the undue influence of marriages outside the prime ages, the father-son correlation was actually negative at --0.1313 for sons marrying in the period 1825-49 (described as "remarkably low," p. 263), and -0.115 for the middle of the eighteenth century. Mother-daughter pairs showed a different pattern with the corresponding values of -0.0012 and 0.1253, respectively.
Neel and Schull (1972, p. 345) computed correlations of 0.09 and 0.07 be-

tween the fertility of a group of Amish couples who married in the period 1820-79 in Ohio and Indiana and the sibship sizes of wives and husbands. These values were described as "small" even though birth control was not used, suggesting that the relationship was only expected to be observed among noncontraceptors.
Bocquet-Appel and Jakobi (1993) studied the correlations between various kin groups, including parents and their children in the village of Arthez d'Asson in the French Department of Pyrenees Atlantiques. The population was based on once-married women in successive generations with intact marriages at age 45 for both partners, and the older generation was born between 1744 and 1789 to ensure that the whole period covered was pre-transitional (the fertility of the younger generation was centered about 1830). The formal path analytic model is concerned with wider aspects of intergenerational transmission of fertility. However, they found a very small correlation (0.015; N = 257) for fertility of parents and children (sexes were not disaggregated), whereas the value for sibs (0.185; N = 200) was much larger and statistically significant. They note that the emphasis on mother-daughter pairs in previous work may be misplaced, and they reject a mechanism of intergenerational transmission of fertility in this pre-transitional period, not only on empirical grounds, but also on the theoretical arguments of Jacquard (1977, 1983).
The period from the mid-nineteenth century has been investigated by Wise and Condie (1975) and Anderton et al. (1987). Both used data from the Mormon Genealogical Library, the former following an initial sample of 402 families with

the wife born between 1825 and 1850, whose youngest and oldest married children were followed up for the next three generations, producing samples of 329, 248, and 89 families respectively. Persons who married more than once in the childbearing phase were excluded from the analysis. Thus, the sample yielded about 100 marriages in each decade since 1840. They found that the correlation between number of children of the marriage and the size of mothers' family of orientation was higher than that for fathers in four of the five cohorts in the period 1861-70 to 1901-10. However, since that date, fathers' size of family of orientation was found to exert a greater influence than that of mothers (see Figure 2 constructed from Wise and Condie's Table 3).
The overall correlations between fertility in the first and second generations was 0.213 and 0.234 with fathers' and mothers' families; 0.171 and 0.242 for the second and third generations; but --0.028 and -0.147 for the third and fourth generations. They conclude that there was a "definite shift toward the tendency for those from large families to bear small families and vice versa" (p. 148). This negative relationship is not replicated in any other study, apart from two rural Japanese communities discussed later, and the interpretation of these results is complicated for a number of reasons. Over the study period, the composition of this population changed from predominantly non-Mormon to Mormon; the number of observations per decade is relatively small; and the population is selected, being the oldest or youngest child for a number of generations in a population with large family sizes. No separate coefficients are given for parents with youngest or oldest children. The fact that

only 89 families in the fourth generation are available, less than 25 per cent of the full sample expected from the original 402 families, means that they are likely to be very disproportionately drawn from the first-born group generation-by-generation. If the first birth was at age 20 and the last at 40, there would be very few last-born descendants of any generation in the sample. As will be discussed later, birth order is a variable of considerable significance in the analysis of the intergenerational transmission of fertility. I would therefore give little weight to the later results of Wise and Condie (1975), especially since they are out of line with a number of more representative studies covering the same period.
The study by Anderton et al. (1987) was based on a similar population to that of Wise and Condie (1975), although only one generation was studied: women born in the period 1830 to 1870 who married in the age range 10-24, who had uninterrupted nonpolygamous marriages up to age 45, and who had at least one daughter. Similar marriage restrictions were placed on their daughters. Thus, the comparison is of the fertility of the older generation occurring in a broad band around 1880, with that of the younger generation occurring in an even broader band around 1910. However, the basic sample size consisting of 5,668 mothers and 8,058 daughters was much larger than that of Wise and Condie. For some analyses, the age at marriage restriction was removed, but full dating of events was required. Daughters had to have between 2 and 13 children, which gave a sample of 5,638 linked mother-daughter pairs.
In this study, the youngest cohort was childbearing around the 1890's, and their

daughters were doing so around the 1920's. Therefore it does provide some information on the apparent turn-around for births occurring in the period 1921-30, among which Wise and Condie found that the correlation coefficient between mothers' and children's family sizes became negative. Although they do not present correlation coefficients, Anderton et al. (1987) confirmed the positive intergenerational association in the earlier period and concluded that the relationship of mothers' to daughters' fertility is likely to have arisen mainly through correlated ages at marriage. Gam (1980) noted that there is a genetic correlation of 0.2 to 0.3 between ages of menarche of mothers and daughters.

Anderton et al.'s fertility results (1987, Table 2) are presented in the form of cross-tabulations of a three-fold category, high, medium, and low, for mothers and daughters. For the earliest 1830-39 cohort of mothers, the X2 value of this 3X3 table was 10.65 (4 d.f., based on a total sample size of 837). For the latest 1860-69 cohort, the corresponding value was 57.98 (N = 3,445).3 Allowing for the sample size differences, such as using Pearson's B statistic, Vp^/iV) (Bishop et al., 1975, p. 380-87), there is a strengthening of the relationship over the period.
3Thesecalculations are not affected by the fact that the rows and columns of these tables should be reversed. See the correction in Demography 25(3), p. 475.

A crude measure, but one which permits more direct comparison with other studies, is the correlation coefficient based on the assumption that the high, medium, and low groups form an interval scale (Pearson's B is identical to the standard correlation coefficient for a 2X2 table). The correlation coefficients in these two cases are 0.058 and 0.118, respectively. Thus, there is clear evidence that the relationship between fertility of mothers and daughters actually becomes stronger over this period, although this fact was not noted in the paper. Indeed, in a later proportional hazards model, they stated that "birth cohorts are excluded from the model to avoid their artificially accounting for variation in other proximate fertility determinants" (p. 477).
EARLY PART OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY
Although they do not refer to work by Pearson et al. (1899), "reproductive selection" underpinned Huestis and Maxwell's (1932) analysis of the number of sibs and mother's number of sibs of 638 white female students at the University of Oregon. Their study involved a generally higher status U.S. population and compared two generations which practiced increasing family limitation. The correlation coefficients for the separate urban/rural and total populations were very similar: rural, 0.104; urban, 0.111; total, 0.124." They conclude that the "environment," which they appear to define as the wider socioeconomic situation rather than, for exam-

ple, how the parents treated their children, is the key determinant of average fertility levels, with biological factors being weak. Pearl (1939), reviewing these two studies, called the correlations unimpressive and argued that unmeasured factors mean that "a cautious person will find it impossible to accept this evidence for the inheritance of human fertility at prima facie valuation" (p. 36).
Bresard's (1950) analysis is noteworthy as the first "modern" study using a contemporary representative sample, although only of males. The study was based on a much larger sample than many later sources, collecting information on 45,000 people in France from 3,000 male respondents aged 18 to 50 in 1948. The main focus was on intergenerational occupational mobility, but some information was presented on the association between respondents' number of sibs and the number of fathers' and mothers' sibs (collected as number of children of father and both grandfathers). This study shows the relationship of childbearing which took place in the early part of the century with that of childbearing a generation earlier, centered on the decade of the 1880's. For the group of farmers and peasants (cultivateurs exploitants) accounting for 34 per cent of the sample and regarded as one with little intergenerational occupational change, the correlation coefficients were 0.265 (N = 1,035) for paternal and 0.237 (N = 1,036) for maternal grandfather's number of children with the respondent's number of sibs.5 These father-son correlations were

4There appears to be an error in Table 1; thefigures for mothers and daughters in city families seem to have been transposed. This error has the effect of considerably reducing population heterogeneity.

5Thesefigureswere calculated from Bresard, 1950, Table XXVI, p. 557.1 assumed that the average family size of 4- or 5-child families was 4.5, and 6.5 for 6-ormore child families. The results are insensitive to the exact choice.

much higher than those of Pearson et al. (1899) and also show no clear differential for the effect of number of mothers' and fathers' sibs on family size. The relationship was even more clear-cut at the extremes of the distribution. For fathers whose father was an only child, 28 per cent had only one child (who had to be a son because of the sample design) and 4 per cent had 6 or more children. For fathers whose father was from a family of size 6 or more, only 9 per cent had a single son, but 23 per cent had 6 or more children. Unfortunately, these data cannot be controlled for age, and it is not possible to calculate correlations for other groups or for the overall population. On the other hand, Moberg (1950) found no clear relationship between the fertility and sibship sizes of men who matriculated in 1910 and 1920 in Sweden, but this study had data problems in that respondents appeared unclear whether or not they should include themselves in the number of brothers and sisters.
For a slightly later period of childbearing of the second generation, around the 1920's and 1930's, there were studies in Britain (Berent, 1953) and the United States (Kantner and Potter, 1954). Both were based on sample surveys, although neither was completely random. Berent's (1953) results were based on LewisFanning's 1946-47 hospital-based survey undertaken for the Royal Commission on Population of 1,377 couples who were in their first marriage which was of at least 15 years duration. Kantner and Potter (1954) used an almost identical sample size from the \9A\-M Indianapolis study of 1,444 white, native, Protestant, elementary-school-graduate couples who married in the period 1927-29, with wife below age 30 and husband below age 40,

and who had lived the majority of their married lives in a large city. Berent found that there was a positive correlation between both husbands' and wives' families of orientation and their number of children, and the effect was larger for wives than for husbands. The overall value of the correlation coefficient was 0.187, which Berent referred to as small. Because both social and biological mechanisms for the relationship had been proposed, he undertook separate analyses for birth-controllers and non-birth-controllers. He found that the correlation was slightly higher for the former group (0.199) as compared to the latter (0.174). He also broke the sample down into three social classes and found the correlation was somewhat higher (0.219) in the middle social status of skilled manual workers than for non-manual workers (r = 0.154) or semi-skilled/unskilled manual workers (r = 0.143), although none of the differences were statistically significant. Thus, the major impression was of similarity, rather than difference, between groups.
In what appears to have been a direct response to Berent (1953), Kantner and Potter (1954) strongly emphasized the weakness of the relationship (p. 308-309): " . . . the data [from the Indianapolis study] in some respects are consistent with the hypothesis that the wife's family of origin exerts a stronger influence on a couple's fertility than the husband's family of origin, but the influence in both cases is so minor as to make the comparison fairly meaningless." They do not refer to the much more substantial values reported by Bresard (1950). It should be noted, however, that their sample was highly selected and had not yet fully completed childbearing since the interviews took place about 13 years after

130

marriage, although they claimed that only minor changes in family size were likely to occur. They found a substantial relationship only for families where the number of sibs of husbands and wives were the same. In this case, the correlation coefficient with children was 0.21 compared with the overall figure of 0.11. However, with sample sizes of around 1,400 in both of these studies there is only a marginally statistically significant difference between the overall correlation coefficients of the two studies (p < 0.05, p > 0.01). Given the selected nature of the Indianapolis sample, the existence of similar overall magnitudes in the two countries is plausible. In their conclusions, Kantner and Potter draw attention to a number of reasons why their findings are likely to be atypical, such as the divergence in urban/rural and educational backgrounds of parents and children and the very unusual 1927-41 study period. Nevertheless, they conclude (p. 311) that "while there are definite reasons for expecting the hypothesis [about a positive relationship between generations] to have more limited significance among Indianapolis couples than it has had elsewhere, this does not diminish the importance of the conclusion that for a group such as the one studied here, the paternal generation exercises very slight influence on the size of their children's families." It is open to argument that these caveats do diminish the significance of this study. There are other points in the paper that should be noted. When separate analyses were performed, the correlation coefficient for the fertility of efficient family planners with parents' fertility was 0.09 (also 0.09 with the wife's family size, but -0.05 with the husband's), whereas values for inefficient family planners were

described as "negligible," although the values were 0.08 and 0.07 for wives and husbands, respectively (p. 304, Table 8). There was a negative rather than a positive relationship for large first generation families, those with 4 or more sibs.
RECENT POPULATIONS
Pearson et al. assumed that the mechanism of transmission was biological rather than social. They devoted considerable discussion to the population dynamics implications of differential fertility.6 They assumed that biological inheritance must come through the female line (although they argued that it could be passed from grandmothers to granddaughters, through fathers). The correlation for 1,000 granddaughters and their paternal grandmothers for members of the peerage, both of whom had been married for at least 15 years, was 0.1123 (Figure 1). Pearson et al. argued that this finding reflected transmission through the intervening (male) generation, although the correlation between fathers and sons was much weaker than this value, and that on theoretical grounds the correlation between paternal grandmothers and granddaughters should be half of the value for mothers and daughters. They concluded that this finding was confirmed by their data. Pearson et al.'s paper was presented two years before Mendel's clas-
6Unfortunately, he failed to consider the effects of the proportion of those who do not marry. The considerable attention to the possible assumed harmful effects of differential fertility in the eugenics and policy debates of the early part of the twentieth century was substantially distorted by failure to consider the effect of differential nonreproduction. It is interesting to speculate what might have happened if Pearson had emphasized the importance of looking at those who do not marry, rather than appearing to dismiss it in a simple footnote stating he found no relationship between family size and propensity to marry.

sic 1865 paper came to the attention of the wider scientific community through the work of Hugo de Vries, Car Correns, and Erik von Tschermah, and it was much later before Mendel's work was put onto a modern footing. The relationship between fathers and sons was partly interpreted as reflecting an attenuated mother-son effect, since it was actually a parent-son relationship. Pearson et al. did not look at the joint relationship between fathers and mothers and their children, nor did Williams and Williams (1974). The lack of attention to social factors means that some possible issues cannot be addressed. For example, noble families may have a strong interest in having a male heir in order to perpetuate the lineage. Therefore, at the margin, some differentials might be expected.
Fisher (1930) estimated the genetic component of fertility using Pearson's correlation coefficient of 0.2096 for mothers and daughters, although alternative pairs would have given him much lower values (Figure 1). For a wholly genetically determined trait, this covariance would be half of the variance, giving a figure of 42 per cent. In addition, the estimate based on grandmother/granddaughter correlation suggested a value of 39 per cent (Williams and Williams, 1974).
Williams and Williams (1974) only computed correlation coefficients for fatherson pairs of different generations. These coefficients fell from 0.168 to 0.036 to 0.021 over the three generations studied, which were based on the grandparental generation born in the period 1740 to 1800. This time period was chosen to ensure that the great majority of the grandsons would have completed their fertility by the 1880's in order to maximize comparability with Pearson and Lee's study. Thus, over time they found that the rela-

tionship between sibship size and fertility became less important. However, the overall value for fathers and sons, 0.059, was almost identical to Pearson's value of 0.066. Clearly, use of the father-son rather than mother-daughter data leads to considerably smaller estimated heritability effects. Williams and Williams argued that previous studies, including Pearson et al. (1899), which had attempted to estimate such parameters, were either flawed or produced nonsignificant results, a finding they attributed to the fact that the social environment was the overwhelming determinant. They cited as evidence the fact that correlations often become attenuated when controls are made for socioeconomic variables, and they attributed the reduced correlation over time in their study to the fact that the environment was becoming more changeable in the later period.
A genetic interest underpinned Imaizumi et al.'s (1970) study of about 1,000 families in the rural Japanese community of Uto in Kumamoto Prefecture which used record linkage of the official koseki records. The fertility of five cohorts of women born between 1881-90 and 1921-30 was compared with the sibship sizes of their mothers and fathers. The study included women who were childbearing up to 1966. Imaizumi et al. did not state whether only married women were included, but it appears likely. The data were acknowledged to be incomplete, especially for females, and the widespread practice of adoption could bias results, especially in the earlier period. However, the correlations with father's sibship size were generally small and, if anything, negative (Figure 3). The values from the related studies of Neel and Schull (1972) and Bocquet-Appel and Jakobi (1993) are also shown in Figure 3.

Bresard (1950) also emphasized the role of preferences but did not find the intergeneration fertility relationship a main topic of interest. Berent (1953) argued that if there was a transmission of a predisposition to have a particular number of children, the result would be seen among successful family planners. However, the relationship for ever-users and neverusers of contraception within every social class was very similar. He interpreted the never-user data as confirming a biological hereditary component and the ever-user data as confirming the inheritance of "family building habits," but he identified these correlation coefficients as showing a "rather small" effect (p. 47).
Kantner and Potter (1954, p. 295) argued that intergenerational transmission in modern populations was largely determined by the older generation shaping ideas or instilling preferences about family formation in the younger generation. This approach reflected the emerging concentration on child socialization as a primary mechanism of transmission of behavior. However, a major focus of the paper was to emphasize the weakness of the relationship. They suggest that for populations such as their sample, the socioeconomic characteristics of the parents and children were very different in terms of rural/urban residence and education and that this difference might affect the strength of transmission mechanisms. They also argued that with less variation in fertility levels, such effects would be likely to die away (even though they found the relationship to be strong only for small family sizes in the first generation and actually negative for large family sizes). We argue later and elsewhere (Murphy and Wang, 1998) that the reverse is actually the case.
In the period around the 1960's in the United States, there was considerable at-

tention paid to the relationship between parental family size and their children's fertility intentions and attitudes, especially to the extent to which the findings of a positive association remained after various socioeconomic controls were included in the multivariate approach which has come to dominate quantitative research. If intentions' data were accurate predictors, they would permit much more up-to-date analysis of intergenerational relationships because these opinions could be used as a proxy for later fertility. This review will not emphasize such hypotheses, since their validity for this purpose is unestablished. Indeed, paradoxically, there is evidence that some intergenerationally transmitted genetic effects are more likely to be observed later in life (McGue et al., 1993). Moreover, the samples and methods used make it difficult to compare actual results with expectations data. What is valuable from such studies is their ability to generate hypotheses that may be tested with more suitable data.
Westoff et al.'s (1961) analysis of the 1,165 eligible couples in the 1957 Family Growth in Metropolitan America study had similar restrictions to those in the Indianapolis study. In addition, their study was confined to women of at least parity two. This further restriction makes comparisons with other sources problematic. Nonetheless, Westoff et al. (1961, pp. 287-292) found correlation coefficients of 0.11 and 0.10 for number of children desired and number of sibs for husbands and wives, respectively (N = 938). They concluded that the relationship was likely to be stronger if the woman had experienced satisfactory childhood experiences, a theme that was to become of major interest. When this sample was reinterviewed later in 1960, there were positive

134

correlations of 0.08 and 0.04 between number of sibs and of wife and husband and number of pregnancies since the second birth (Westoff et al., 1963, p. 204). The sample was reinterviewed in 196266, and the regression coefficient for completed parity on wife's number of sibs was 0.04, but increased to 0.06 after controlling for education and age at marriage (Bumpass and Westoff, 1970, p. 91).
Duncan et al. (1965) included information about expected family size from 2,713 white wives aged 18-39 living with their husbands from the Growth of American Families (GAF) 1955 Survey and also their live births by survey date together with 8,300 wives aged 27-46 with the same characteristics, and a further 4,000 wives aged 47-61 in 1962 from the Current Population Survey (CPS). They found a positive linear relationship between successive generations' fertility, but no differences in the effect of fathers and mothers or suggestions of a curvilinear relationship. The relationship was stronger for the older CPS cohort, but the younger group is affected by censoring of experience. They presented regression coefficients, rather than correlation coefficients, and since the variance in parent's sibship size is larger than that of children's fertility, correlation coefficients will be larger than the regression coefficients.7 For the older cohort, the simple regression coefficients are 0.111 for wives' number of siblings and 0.101 for husbands' siblings. For the younger cohort,
7Thesimple linear regression coefficient is given by ry/x. In practice, the standard deviation is similar to the corresponding mean, so a reasonable approximation is to use the ratio of numbers of sibs and children. For the 27-47 year-old CPS sample, the value computed from Table 2 is 1.61, and the regression coefficient is 0.099.

the values were 0.061 and 0.070, respectively. In their samples, inclusion of educational level, farm background, and duration of marriage reduces the magnitude of the sibling regression coefficient by about half for the older cohort and twothirds for the younger group (where they noted that this will also reflect timing influences). While there are arguments for controlling for educational level and farm background, the assumption that duration of marriage is somehow independent of "fertility" is questionable. If there is a propensity for fertility to be transmitted intergenerationally, difference in marriage is the primary mechanism through which it would be expected to operate as Anderton et al. (1987) noted. While Duncan et al. (1965, p. 514) acknowledged the possibility that intergenerational transmission could involve "physical inheritance of some trait associated with low fecundity (e.g., blood type)", socialization mechanisms were emphasized, and they suggested that intergenerational stability was necessary for such mechanisms to operate. While they reported that the relationship was stronger than average among "fecund planners," the implications of this finding for how the relationship might evolve over time is not explored.
Hendershot (1969) followed up Duncan et al.'s (1965) hypothesis that socialization was the key mechanism for transferring fertility through generations. He argued that this pattern was more likely to be observed in children who were "satisfied" with their upbringing and who were "conformist." The sample was highly selected, 389 freshmen women in Midwest liberal arts colleges, a largely upper middle-class group. He concluded that attitudes to family size were positively related to parent's family size, but

also that this relationship was stronger among women who felt closer to their families and was stronger for first-born women. Westoff and Potvin's (1967) survey of 15,000 freshmen and senior women in U.S. colleges, which showed that for all religious groups, especially Catholics, there was a direct linear relationship between number of siblings and desired family size, reinforced this conclusion. One interesting aspect of Hendershot's study was that conformism was assumed to be more common among first-born women and the relationship was found to be stronger among first-born women. However, McAllister et al. (1974), using a sample of 635 tenth-graders (male and female) from four Southern counties (a generally lower socioeconomic status group), found no relationship between size of family of orientation or a special role for first-borns. They were able to replicate Hendershot's results only for the comparable group of white females who expected to attend college. Thus, they concluded that such continuities are likely to be found only in selected groups where little change in lifestyle is anticipated.
Johnson and Stokes' (1976) analysis, based on 901 women who had been followed up since being sophomores in rural Pennsylvania high schools in 1947, deserves special attention. They were oncemarried and living with their husbands in 1971, and almost all were aged 40 to 44 years. Information had been collected on number of sibs in 1947 which was related to the number of their own children (including those who were childless). Analyses were presented mainly in the form of regression models, but the standardized regression coefficients were simple Pearson product moment correlation coefficients that may be compared

with other studies. The overall correlation coefficient was 0.140, and number of sibs was described as "weakly related to marital fertility, particularly when compared to the influences of other variables" (p. 181), although no other coefficients were presented. In part, this conclusion was based on the fact that the regression coefficient was 40 per cent lower than the correlation coefficient. However, this finding simply reflected the ratio of standard deviations of the distribution of fertility of the two generations (Murphy and Wang, 1998).
This study population had many advantages: the number with completed fertility was large; the population was relatively homogeneous, but not at the extremes of the socio-economic continuum; and longitudinal information was available. Johnson and Stokes provided both theoretical arguments and empirical evidence that the relationship was stronger for three particular groups: firstborns, for whom the correlation coefficient was 0.256 compared with 0.132 for later-borns; those with similar lifestyles to their parents (operationalized as the closeness of number of years of schooling) for whom the correlation was 0.218 compared with 0.118 for the change group; and those who had expressed satisfaction with their family life at age 16 (r = 0.175 compared with 0.022 for the dissatisfied). For first-borns without a change in lifestyle, the correlation coefficient was 0.419. However, while less than one-quarter had no change in lifestyle, over 80 per cent expressed themselves as satisfied. The link between size of family of orientation and fertility was once more confirmed, at least for women, and the "sociological" explanation that satisfaction with life as a child is the key mechanism which

136

underpins the relationship was consistent with many of the more general theories of the importance of the socialization of children.
Since the primary focus in this review is on demographic factors, attention will be concentrated on the birth order variable. The fact that the reported correlation coefficient for first-born women is twice the value for later-born women is striking. The theoretical justification is based on the greater conformity associated with first-born children (Schachter, 1964; see also Sulloway, 1996). However, these comparisons do not control size of family. For Johnson and Stokes' study population the average number of sibs of those who are first-born (just over two) is only half the number of sibs of the laterborn. All of those from one-child families are first-born, but only one-in-ten of those in a ten-child family. For a laterborn child, none are from a one-child family, and there is a 90 per cent chance that a child from a 10-child family will be later-born. Thus, the interpretation of a birth order effect will tend to be confounded with family size unless the relationship is linear across all birth orders. This point is also relevant to the interpretation of Wise and Condie's (1975) results, in addition to the over-representation of first-borns discussed earlier.
The pervasive influences of economic models at this time was also evident, especially the Easterlin approach which appears to give a particular emphasis to the childhood environment as an influence on subsequent behavior. Ben-Porath (1975) used this framework as the basis for investigating the relationship between generations, particularly the role of income. The data source was the 1968-70 files of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics

(PSID). The analysis was based mainly on 973 white non-Catholic wives aged 35 and over. Catholics and Blacks were rejected because it was stated that their fertility could not be regarded as approximately completed (no controls for age were included in the analysis), although they also appear to conform less well to the economic rationality model proposed. The correlation coefficient between number of wife's siblings and children was 0.177 (very similar in absolute magnitude to the correlation coefficients for husband's and wife's education and number of children of -0.194 and of -0.159, respectively). Although the first sentence of the paper's abstract states that the predicted income of the husband's father is inversely related to the family's number of children, the f-statistic for this variable is only 0.96 (p = 0.34) when farm background is included in the paper's final analysis (Table 6), a very weak relationship. However, the number of wife's siblings variable remains much stronger (f = 1.89, p = 0.059). Thus, on the basis of this empirical analysis, the role of economic factors would appear to be inconsequential compared with number of sibs.8
Duncan et al. (1965) had suggested that stability of lifestyle might promote intergenerational transmission of fertility. Anderton et al. (1987) accepted the socialization framework, but noted that the role of the family appeared to be more important than external influences and that the key factor was relative rather than absolute fertility (i.e., if the mother had below average fertility compared
8The model does not allow for the fact that the number of children will also affect the child's standard of living. Easterlin assumes that it is the children's experience, not their parents', which is relevant.

with her peers, then her daughter was also likely to do so). They reflect the dismissive attitude to biological mechanisms stating that "Early studies . . . even attributed transmission of fertility norms and preferences to heredity." Kantner and Potter (1954) were quoted to show the negligible relationship compared with Berent's "weak" results. However, as argued earlier, these values probably do not differ significantly at the 1 per cent level. In their review of contemporary studies, Anderton et al. (1987, p. 468) used "weak" four times, "modest" twice, and "negligible" once to categorize the nature of the relationship, with nothing to suggest the existence of any substantial effect. In a systematic investigation of relative explanatory power of different types of variables, Murphy (1987) considered 15 aspects of family formation for women aged 30-39 and 40-49 in the 1976 British Family Formation Survey (Dunnell, 1979). The variable of number of wife's and husband's sibs combined was found to be statistically significantly related to 63 per cent (N = 19) of these women. A series of 17 variables measuring various aspects of socioeconomic status, educational level and employment experiences were constructed, and 15 of these 17 had lower scores than the sibs variable. The two with higher values referred to the current (i.e., post-reproductive) status of the woman.
However, even if variables related to socialization factors, including stability of lifestyle and childhood satisfaction, are related to subsequent fertility, this finding would not mean that the causal role of socialization had been confirmed, unless it can be shown how socialization is correlated to the genetic and environmental backgrounds of the "biological" and "sociological" parents. The only de-

signs that would provide discrimination between such factors do not lie in evermore detailed replications of panel or longitudinal studies, but rather designs such as those of twin and adoption studies that permit the relative contribution of genes, environment, and their interaction to be determined. A recent study based on Danish twins born in the period 1900-23 suggests a substantial genetic component to fertility (Kohler et al., 1999).
More recently, attention has been given to this topic as an aspect of intergenerational relations and social policy aspects of an aging society. Pullum and Wolf (1991) present data on correlations between living sibs and children for Canada, using the 1985 General Social Survey for 5-year age groups from 55-59 to 85+ based on sample sizes of about 400 in each age group. The largest correlation coefficients, about 0.32, are for those around age 60, with values declining at older ages. However, since these figures are based on living sibs, death of siblings will increasingly affect values. U.S. data from the Longitudinal Study of Aging are for sisters and daughters only, with correlation coefficients typically just under 0.1 and therefore not comparable with other data discussed here. Pullum and Wolf also present correlation coefficients from the 1981-82 German Life History Survey for ever-born siblings and children for cohorts born 1949-51 (who will not have completed childbearing) of 0.2127 for the 1939-41 cohort (N = 727) and 0.1552 for the 1929-31 cohort (N = 709). They also quote a 1974 study from Israel of women aged 35 and over for whom the correlation coefficient is 0.286 (N = 708). However, over one-third of this sample was of Asian or African ancestry with much higher average levels of fertility than the others

which is likely to inflate correlation coefficients (Danziger and Neuman, 1989).
Two additional sets of results will now be presented. Table 1 shows data from the 1976 British Family Formation, giving the relationship of the fertility of women with the number of their own and their partner's sibs, and the number of sibs for all women regardless of their marital status. The influences of husbands' and wives' family sizes are essentially equal, and there is no evidence of change in the strength of the relationship over time. However, correlation coefficients are considerably larger if the average of husbands' and wives' sibs is used rather than each taken separately. This finding holds true even when the number of sibs is different. Perhaps surprisingly, the correlation for all women is slightly larger than for women with a partner (the great majority of whom were husbands).
Table 2 shows correlations from the 1987-88 U.S. National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH) for number of children and number of sibs with whom the respondent lived while growing up. This table shows an increase in the correlation coefficient value for younger cohorts, the value for the youngest cohort being twice that for the oldest one shown. For these two recent data sources, the correlation coefficients are mostly in the range 0.15 to 0.20.
CONCLUSIONS
Figure 4 and Table 3 show the trend in reported correlations between number of siblings and children for the majority of studies discussed earlier. There is a clear tendency for the value to increase steadily over time.
Thus, for parental generations born in a band about the middle of the nineteenth

century and for a second generation born around the turn of the century, a large number of studies based on different data sources report correlation coefficients between numbers of parents and children. These dates are approximate, in that, for example, children bora about 1900 are assumed to have parents born around 1870. In the case of broad age coverage such as the Berent (1953) study, women covered the age range from about 35 in 1946, and it is assumed that their birth dates were around 1900 on average. Taken as a whole, these data show a high level of consistency with values of about 0.15 for countries such as the United States and Britain, but higher values for the particular French population, and similar values for those bearing children up to the 1940's. However, for the 1960's, values around 0.2 are more typical. The largest reported values are from France, Canada, and Israel, and values appear to be increasing over recent periods.
This paper has summarized the demographic and related literature over the past hundred years on the topic of the correlation of fertility between parents and children and highlighted a number of issues that will be summarized here.
TRENDS OVER TIME
No definitive answer can be given about the strength of the relationship in pre-transitional historical populations since there is some doubt about the quality of the reconstitution data such as those used by Langford and Wilson (1985), but both empirical evidence and theoretical arguments suggest that the value was close to zero. Occasional studies have reported a decline in the strength of the relationship with time (Williams and Williams, 1974; Wise and Condie,

1975). Virtually none have reported a stronger relationship, either on the basis of comparisons of different studies or from individual studies. Moreover, although a number of studies find the relationship is stronger, or no weaker, for more "modern" groups such as family planners compared with more "traditional" groups, the conclusion that the relationship may become more substantial as the proportion of "modern" groups increases has not been drawn. However, I argue that both com-

parative analysis, such as shown in Figure 4, and generalizable individual studies such as those of Anderton et al. (1987), of Imaizumi et al. (1970), and of NSFH data show that this relationship is becoming stronger through time.

than of fathers, although full investigations of their joint influences are rare. However, Pearson et al.'s differentials between males and females are so out of line with other studies as to suggest either a very highly selected population or some systematic bias in their data. The suggestion by Kantner and Potter (1954) that there appears to be an interaction term when fathers and mothers come from the same size families remains an untested hypothesis. Such considerations raise the more general point of the role of homogamy on population dynamics. Effects tend to be greater in cases where the children's characteristics do not differ substantially from their parents, such as children who have broadly similar levels of education to their parents (and an addi-

tional hypothesis is that this would be even stronger if the parents themselves were alike in their characteristics). Intergenerational similarity of lifestyle tends to increase the strength of the observed relationship, but whether the relationship can be explained in terms of a particular proximate determinant such as intergenerational continuities in age at start of childbearing remains unclear. Only relatively few studies have considered the role of marriage, but Anderton et al. (1987) suggest that observed correlations in fertility between generations are largely a consequence of similarity in ages at marriage. Most "biological" analyses have implicitly assumed that fecundability is the key parameter, with the role of other intermediate fertility variables not considered.

OTHER SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC INFLUENCES
Work on birth order effects provides further insights into possible mechanisms at work (Johnson and Stokes, 1976). The particular time period over which the analysis was undertaken and the possible specialized nature of the population used raises the question of how far these findings hold in the wider context. One topic that has not been addressed is the pattern of nonmarriage according to size of family of orientation. In some of the historical populations considered here, perhaps a third of women may never have married, and in the early twentieth century only one-half may have had more than a single

child. If mother-daughter correlations were thought to be relevant to discussion of population dynamics, then inclusion of nonbreeders would be important. Most studies have confined the second generation to married couples, usually those in intact first marriages, but such restrictions are no longer tenable within the fluid lifestyles experienced today.
The relationship is becoming stronger in developed societies, but this conclusion is mainly based on comparing completed fertility of the younger generation with that of their parents, rather than analysis of contemporary childbearing. Younger generations are now more likely to adopt an individualistic approach to

demographic decisions. Moreover, the pace of socioeconomic change would be expected to attenuate any intergenerational trends (Lesthaeghe and Meekers, 1986). On the other hand, the a la carte menu of this epoch following the Second Demographic Transition, and the wider set of options available, could provide an extended social space for such patterns to manifest themselves.

Little attention has been given to the relationship of fertility between sibs, apart from the genetically-orientated studies of Imaizumi et al. (1970) and BocquetAppel and Jakobi (1993). However, if a mechanism generates similarities between parents and children, then it should also generate a correlation between sibs. The literature on birth order tends to assume that differences are due to socialization in that, for example, first-born girls from large families in the past may have been reluctant to follow their mother's footsteps because they had to undertake childcare responsibilities, With smaller families, this factor may be less relevant.
One key issue that has still not been satisfactorily addressed is the hypothesis dismissed by Huestis and Maxwell (1932) that there may be an inherited (i.e., genetic) propensity to have a given family size (p. 77): " . . . there are probably genetic differences in the desire for children as well as the ability to have them, comparable to differences in height, body build and the like." In contrast to earlier work which assumed that any relationship was likely to be found only in noncontracepting populations, it is plausible that it will be manifested in post-transitional ones and that any genetic mechanism will be behavioral rather than physiological.

However, none of the studies considered so far, including longitudinal ones, apart from Kohler and Christensen, are able to distinguish between genetic and socialization factors and their interactions. One possible way to address this issue, in addition to the classic twin and adoption studies, would be to look at the outcomes for sibs of different levels of genetic similarity if there are sufficient numbers who are brought up in different environments. The most obvious group to study might be the children of men who have children by more than one partner.
For contemporary industrialized populations, biological ability (or fecundability) is relevant as a topic of study only in interaction with behavioral factors, such as the reduced ability of women who choose to start childbearing at older ages to be able to do so. Age at first marriage has been found to be an important proximate determinant of the correlation between generations9 as has familial satisfaction. One is a proximate and the other a remote determinant, and their relationship could be clarified. However, early age at marriage is also associated with parental divorce. In developed countries such as Britain, more couples now divorce than have three or more children, so that partnership behavior itself may be a major confounding factor.
SCIENTIFIC CONTEXT
The attention and explanations given to the relationship between fertility of successive generations mirrors the prevailing scientific orthodoxies of the pe-
9As with most fertility studies, the proximate determinants framework is a natural one to adopt. To do so might clarify many of the issues raised in the literature discussed here.

riod. Pearson et al. were interested in biological inheritance at a time when eugenic issues were emphasized. In the 1940's and 1950's, interest in family planning led to work on differences between users and nonusers of contraception, with an assumption that the analysis of these groups separately would lead to differentiation of "biological" and "social" influences. There was also a move to downplay intergenerational differences. However, intergenerational fertility transmission was later absorbed within the boundaries of socialization theory, and rather than being interpreted as a biological phenomenon, it was used as evidence to show that early socialization of children tended to be repeated in the following generation. Indeed, size of family of orientation appeared sometimes to be considered only a noisy proxy indicator for the parents' norms and attitudes that were passed down through their children.
The repeated tendency for authors to refer to the small value of the intergenerational effect has already been discussed. Nonetheless, Berent (1953) shows that the average number of children for women in the highest sibship group (14 per cent of the sample) had an average of 4.41 children, compared with 2.63 for those in the smallest group (12 per cent of the sample). Any classification which found such differences between broad groups would usually be described as substantial in the context of contemporary fertility studies. However, the differences arise from an underlying relationship that in itself is described as small. The reason may be that those researchers undertook most analysis from tabular material where differences between groups were discussed. Microlevel calculations were rarely undertaken (Pearson refers to having spent a week

with a colleague to calculate two correlation coefficients!), and the fact that apparently small micro-level differences lead to large differences in tabulated data was insufficiently appreciated.
Kincade Oppenheimer (1994) has pointed out that part of the popularity of variables such as female employment and education in current demographic analysis is that they are seen as positive in themselves and compatible with other desirable outcomes such as female autonomy. The stress on the weakness of the relationship contrasts with most other areas where researchers are anxious to emphasize the strength of the relationships found, suggesting a preference in many cases for alternative explanations. Most social scientists have been traditionally suspicious of biological and genetic explanations. Even analysis of intergenerational socialization factors, such as the effects of children's experiences on subsequent behavior, is largely confined to groups defined as "problematic," such as teenage and single mothers whose life is assumed to be determined by their backgrounds. I suspect that relatively few people (including this author) would subscribe to hypotheses about intergenerational fertility behavior such as that of Potts (1997, p. 5): " . . . we know that hundreds of millions of people . . . have chosen to have fewer than two children. It would not be implausible to argue that such people are genetically different with respect to wanting children from, say, Nigerians who have six children."
Relatively little attention has been given to the role of transmission of fertility from the viewpoint of evolutionary biology, which has been useful in showing the impact of biological factors in core demographic areas of interest such as mortality (Christensen and Vaupel, 1996)
