ABSTRACT: Data on the prevalence of divorce and separation among parents of children with cystic fibrosis and other chronic diseases indicate that marital breakdown is no more prevalent among these couples than it is in a general population. For couples who attended genetic counseling clinics or had children with spina bifida or leukemia, the divorce rate is lower than the United States national average. For parents of children with cystic fibrosis, the divorce rate is the same as the national average. The high recurrence risk for cystic fibrosis may deter many parents from further reproduction. We speculate that the inability to plan more children may be the factor responsible for the higher prevalence of divorce among these parents compared to those of children with other chronic diseases.

Many members of the medical community share the opinion that couples who come for genetic counseling have a higher prevalence of divorce than do couples in the general population. This viewpoint was reinforced when Sorenson (1972), in reviewing the data of Carter and colleagues (1971), reported that the rate of divorce for genetic counseling couples in general was normal, but that it was three times the national average for those couples who reported that genetic counseling had changed their reproductive expectations. In an attempt to verify this statement, a thorough search of the medical literature was undertaken. Although a number of authors have briefly discussed the incidence of divorce among parents of children with chronic diseases and among couples receiving genetic counseling, there are no publications specifically directed to the problem of divorce in these families.
The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the prevalence of divorce among couples

who have brought their children to the Cystic Fibrosis Clinic at The Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri, and to collect and analyze the data of those authors who have briefly discussed the incidence of divorce in their clinics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The sample studied was limited to the parents of 34 children currently followed in the Cystic Fibrosis Clinic of The Children's Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri. All of the parents were interviewed by Michael Begleiter and were asked to complete a one-page questionnaire designed to evaluate marital status and whether the burden of raising a child with cystic fibrosis had altered the marital relationship.
The experiences of others (Allan et al., 1974; Carter et al., 1971; Emery et al., 1973; Freeston, 1971; Friedman et al., 1963; Gluckson et al., 1975; Hamovitch, 1964; Hare et al., 1966; McCollum and

Gibson, 1970; McCrae et al., 1973; Oakley and Patterson, 1966; Reynolds etal., 1974; Stehbens and Lascari, 1974; and Walker et al., 1971) were used to determine the prevalence of divorce and separation among parents of children with chronic diseases and among couples receiving genetic counseling. Although some of these studies were of populations outside the United States, divorce and separation data were pooled with United States samples and compared with the divorce statistics for the general population of the United States. With the limited data available in the literature, our goal was simply to ascertain whether the rate of marital breakdown was unusually high in these families as compared to that in a general population. The 1970 United States census (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1970) was the source of divorce statistics for the general population.
RESULTS
Forty parents representing 31 families were interviewed. In 9 instances, both the mother and father were available for interviewing. In 3 families, there were 2 affected children. The parents ranged in age from 18 to 43 years with a mean age of 30 years. They were interviewed from 3 months to 16 years after the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (CF) had been made, with the mean length of time elapsed since the diagnosis being 4.4 years. In 2 families, divorce had occurred prior to the birth of the CF child; these families were excluded from the study.
There were Sdivorces in the 29 families, giving a prevalance of divorce of 17.2 per cent. In all families where divorce had occurred, the parents felt that the problems associated with raising a child with CF were not the cause of the divorce. In addition, they did not feel that the CF child had been a contributing factor in the

dissolution of their marriage. Two additional families had experienced a breakdown in communication regarding important family issues which created the "web of silence" described by Turk (1964). When asked if caring for the affected child had brought the couple closer together, 5 parents felt it had not, 22 felt that it had, and 6 saw no change in their relationship with their spouses.
DISCUSSION
The prevalence of divorce in our CF clinic families was 17.2 per cent. These data are tabulated with those from other cystic fibrosis clinics (Table 1) in the United States and abroad. Divorces and separations have been pooled for analysis of marital breakdown. The proportion of marital breakdown among the various groups is homogeneous, as the heterogeneity chi-square is 8.90 with S degrees of freedom. The pooled prevalence of marital breakdown is 13.4 per cent, representing 45 instances of divorce or separation in a sample of 33S couples.
For comparison, a similar analysis was done from reviews of the literature on divorce or separation of couples who attended genetic counseling clinics (Table 2). There were 20 instances of marital breakdown in 652 families (3.1 per cent). These data were also homogeneous with respect to rate among the sources (heterogeneity chi-square = 2.19 with 2 degrees of freedom). This low figure is derived from families with disorders of both low and high recurrence risk. Data for a low recurrence risk disorder, spina bifida, are also available (Table 3). In 312 families, there were 9 divorces and no separations, or a prevalence of 2.9 per cent. The pooled data are also homogeneous (chi-square = 0.20 with 2 degrees of freedom).

marital breakdown has to be considered. Four smaller studies of children with acute leukemia are shown in Table 4. Two divorces and two separations occurred in only one study of twenty families. A larger study had no marital breakdowns. Pooling these studies may not be legitimate, but the number in the one study reporting family dissolution is of the same order of magnitude as that in the cystic fibrosis data.
The impression that families with genetic disease have a higher risk of divorce or separation than the general population is clearly mistaken. According to the 1970 census (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1970), 14 per cent of men and 14.4 per cent of women are known to have been divorced. In the age group 25-35 years, the most common age group of couples receiving genetic counseling, the divorce rates are 11.9 per cent for men and 15.5 per cent for women. The sample size of the pooled data for cystic fibrosis parents is such that there is no difference between the divorce rate for these couples and the United States national average. The rates for couples who have children with spina bifida or who have attended genetics clinics are significantly lower.
The reason for this difference is not apparent. If one assumes that couples who have received genetic counseling for a disease with a high risk of recurrence, like CF, have a 13 per cent risk of marital dissolution (Table 1) and couples with a low risk disorder, like spina bifida, have a 3 per cent risk (Table 3), the projected number of marital breakdowns for couples in genetic counseling clinics (Table 2) would be much higher in the British studies (Carter et al., 1971; Emery et al., 1973) but the same in the American study (Reynolds et al., 1974). However, the shift would be significant only if applied to Carter's data.
