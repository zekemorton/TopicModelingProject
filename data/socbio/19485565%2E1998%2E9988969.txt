ABSTRACT: In order to evaluate the role of conditions at conception in the risk of miscarriage, we sent 234 women with at least two consecutive miscarriages after conceptions from the same partner a short questionnaire asking for the birth dates of their mothers and their live or stillborn siblings and the occurrence of any maternal miscarriages. Complete information was provided by 186 respondents. Using matched logistic regression, we investigated whether these women were born more often than their siblings (total n=578) to young ( 19 years) or relatively old ( 40 years) mothers or shortly after a preceding pregnancy (born within 1 year). We also evaluated whether they showed a different month-of-birth distribution. No increased odds ratios were found for young or advanced maternal age, or for short preceding birth intervals. However, relative to their siblings, cases showed a deviant month-of-birth distribution (p=0.08) with a peak in (late) winter. These results indicate that low and high maternal age and short preceding birth intervals are not determinants of the risk of miscarriage in the daughter. They also suggest that there may be seasonally varying factors that prenatally influence the risk of miscarriage.

Knowledge of the etiology of recurrent miscarriage is still fragmentary and at many points uncertain (Stirrat, 1990). One category of putative causes are disorders of reproductive endocrinology. Women with multiple miscarriages have been reported more frequently to have irregular cycles (Quenby and Farquharson, 1993), luteal phase defects (Fritz, 1988), polycystic ovaries (Sagle et al., 1988), and early or late menarche (Bracken et al., 1985). It is possible that (some of) these conditions share a common causal factor.
In the present study, a candidate for such a factor is investigated. Because hormonal disorders may be caused by dysfunction of the ovaries, factors that affect ovarian development may eventually be responsible for multiple miscarriage during later life. In an earlier report, the hy-

pothesis was put forward that ovarian maldevelopment may be a consequence of (preovulatory) overripeness of the oocyte from which the individual originates (Smits et al., 1995). Preovulatory overripeness of the oocyte, being a result of irregularity of the menstrual cycle, is supposed to occur more often at the extremes of the female reproductive period and during the first menstrual cycle(s) after a pregnancy. Presumably, its occurrence also varies across the year. On this basis, we have investigated whether women suffering multiple miscarriages have been born more often to mothers of either young (<19 years) or advanced (>40 years) age, or shortly after a preceding pregnancy (born within 1 year), or show a deviant month-of-birth distribution (i.e., a distribution that differs from

expectation on the basis of normal birth curves).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A short questionnaire was mailed to 234 women participating in a clinical study on unexplained recurrent early pregnancy loss at the University Hospital Nijmegen St. Radboud, The Netherlands, between May 1991 and January 1995 (Wouters et al., 1993). The questionnaire contained questions about the birth dates of their mother and siblings (alive or dead) and the occurrence of any maternal spontaneous abortions. All women had suffered at least two consecutive spontaneous abortions after conceptions from the same partner. Spontaneous abortion was defined as pregnancy loss within 16 weeks of menstrual age, not including ectopic pregnancy and elective abortion. Two reminders were sent out one and four weeks after the initial mailing. Information thus gathered was linked to existing patient information for explorative analyses of etiologically meaningful subgroups.
As comparison data, we used the birth dates of the cases' (female and male) siblings sharing the same biological mother. In using this comparison group, we implicitly matched for possible confounders, such as maternal reproductive behavior and genetic factors. As this matching could introduce bias (the exposure status of cases and siblings is not independent), matched analyses were carried out (Goldstein et al., 1989). It was possible to include male siblings in the reference series, as differences between the distribution of the determinants by sex, if existent, were assumed to be negligible.
Cases who did not have any siblings were excluded from analysis. Case/sib-

ling data was considered amenable for analysis only if all relevant birth dates within one family were complete. Comparison of preceding birth intervals was only feasible where both the case and at least one of the siblings were not a firstborn child.
Distributions of maternal age and preceding birth interval were compared by means of conditional ("matched") logistic regression (Breslow and Day, 1980). To compare month-of-birth distributions of cases and controls, we assumed that if the distributions would differ, they would differ according to a sinusoid form with a period of 1 year (assuming that the influence of the seasonal causal factor would oscillate harmonically with a period of 1 year). By use of the maximum likelihood method, we determined the amplitude and shift of the sinusoid function that fitted best through the calculated deviations (Roger, 1977). Factors referable to amplitude and shift were processed in conditional logistic regression. The difference in --2 log likelihood between a model with and a model without these factors follows, under the (null) hypothesis that the distribution of birth months of the cases is not different from that of the controls, a Chi-square distribution with 2 df.
RESULTS
After two postal reminders, 212 respondents (91 per cent) had returned completed questionnaires. The high response rate may be due to a (proven) motivation to participate in research and to the brevity and simplicity of the questionnaire (maximum eight questions concerning mainly birth dates). Respondents were 18-41 (median 29) years of age at the first one of their successive miscar-

riages. Seventy-nine per cent of the cases had suffered three or more consecutive miscarriages, with a maximum of 10. Maternal birth date was unknown in 1 respondent; birth dates of siblings of 7 cases were incomplete, as were dates of maternal miscarriages in 14 cases. Five cases did not have any siblings, and the median number of siblings was 3. In the end, data of 186 cases and 578 siblings were fit for analysis, among which 101 and 333, respectively, for analysis of preceding birth interval.
Siblings showed a larger standard deviation in year of birth than cases (6.9 vs 4.3 years) and were somewhat more often born before 1960, the median year of birth. Because year of birth may be associated with maternal reproductive behavior within the same mother, we introduced two extra factors into the multivariate analyses, one factor representing the distance of the subject's birth year from 1960 (in years2) and one factor indicating that the subject was born before or after 1960. As comparison of birth interval distribution was possible only in a limited subgroup, multivariate analysis was carried out twice, once excluding and once including birth interval, with the former variant yielding better power.
Table 1 presents summary results. No increased odds ratios (OR's) were observed for low (19 years and under) or advanced (40 years and over) maternal age at birth, or for small (<12 months) preceding birth interval. Figures for low maternal age appeared to be unstable as a result of the small number of observations in this category (3 cases and 7 siblings).
Maternal age and preceding birth interval did not statistically interact. The OR for advanced maternal age, however, appeared to be increased if a subject's

birth followed upon a maternal miscarriage, which was true both for maternal age 35-39 and for age 40 and over (OR's: 3.99 [0.72-21.87] and 4.24 [0.84-21.69], respectively). Birth interval and preceding miscarriage did not show any interaction. In all, there were 17 cases and 53 siblings who had been conceived after a maternal miscarriage.
As opposed to siblings, cases were born more often during late winter, with its zenith at the beginning of March (p=0.08). With a presumed gestation length of 9 months, this would correspond to a relative excess of conceptions leading to cases around the beginning of June. The odds for recurrent miscarriage at the zenith of the fitted sinoid function was nearly two times (1.79) the odds at the trough (at the onset of September). We have examined whether the addition of a sinoid function with a period of 0.5 year to the model would increase its explanatory force, but it did not.
To check whether the observed relative birth seasonality was the result of an association between the month of birth of the case and that of the immediately preceding or following sibling, we carried out three additional analyses: one including the case and the preceding sibling, one including the case and the next sibling, and one excluding the preceding and the next sibling. These analyses resulted in a change in the peak of the sinoid function of a maximum of a half month. Therefore we concluded that no such association was relevant.
We also explored if there were any subgroups of cases for which the determinants under study might be explanatory. Separate analyses were carried out for cases who first miscarried before age 35, who had or did not have a history of

In 20 out of the 186 patients, factors were demonstrable that possibly underlay their recurrent miscarriage. These factors included chromosomal rearrangements in the male («=6) or female (n=7), thyroid disease (n=2), and anticardiolipin antibodies (n=5). Exclusion of these patients and their siblings from analysis did not essentially change the results.
DISCUSSION
The results of this study indicate that women with recurrent miscarriage are more likely to have been born in (late)

winter. They do not seem to have been born more often after short birth intervals or to mothers of young or advanced age.
Our study has some limitations which may have affected the validity and precision of our estimates. First, we did not have any information on the reproductive history of individual siblings. Cases had been asked whether they had any siblings who had suffered two or more spontaneous abortions, but if so, it was not further investigated whether these abortions were successive and from conceptions from the same partner. Nine female siblings were reported to have suffered 2 or more miscarriages. It is difficult to assess whether this figure is representative for the cases' source population. If it is too high, our estimates may be somewhat diluted. A second limitation is that the

numbers of exposed among cases and siblings are small. This led to OR's with broad confidence intervals, especially for low maternal age. Therefore, it is possible that some existing relationship has remained unnoticed. Despite the above reservations, there is no indication that our estimates are strongly biased.
An unanticipated finding in the present study was the increased risk associated with the combination of advanced maternal age and preceding maternal miscarriage. It is not evident how this effect, present in both maternal age 35-39 years and age 40 and over, should be interpreted. One explanation would be that, with increasing maternal age, oocytes have had longer exposure to (environmental) agents that may cause chromosomal anomalies such as translocations; a miscarriage preceding the subject's birth would be a reflection of such chromosomal anomalies, and the woman herself would also run higher risk of carrying a (balanced) translocation, and, as a consequence, higher risk of miscarriage. However, exclusion of 7 women with chromosomal rearrangements did not fully depress the OR's: 2.61 [0.38-17.83] for 35-39 years and 4.05 [0.80-20.63] for 40 years and over. Another explanation, which is in line with our hypothesis, would be that the combination of a preceding miscarriage and advancing maternal age reflects an increasing maternal proneness to preovulatory overripeness. Because the exact maternal age at the time of the preceding miscarriage was often not available, the above explanations cannot be further scrutinized with our data.
The hypothesis underlying this study was that preovulatory overripeness of the oocyte is a cause of ovarian maldevelopment in the conceptus. The resulting ovar-

ian dysfunction would lead to a variety of gynaecologic abnormalities during later life, among them an increased risk of early pregnancy loss. This study is the first in a series of studies in which predictions based on this hypothesis is tested.
At this point, it is difficult to draw any final conclusions about the tenability of the hypothesis itself. One difficulty is that our results do not consistently confirm or falsify the predictions based on the hypothesis. On the one hand, this finding could be the result of a sub-optimum translation of the hypothesis into testable predictions. A general problem in testing this hypothesis is the limited feasibility of measuring exposure to preovulatory overripeness. Inevitably, there has been a large degree of misclassification in this respect. The defined categories (low or advanced maternal age, short birth interval) only designate a higher risk of exposure, not the exposure itself. Furthermore, in using birth intervals of <12 months as an approach of short pregnancy intervals, we inevitably included a number of subjects born pre-term after interpregnancy intervals greater than 3 months (Metcalf, 1979; Wunsch and Termote, 1978), thereby including subjects with lower risk of exposure. As mentioned before, because of the small numbers of observations, it may have been impossible to discern any weak associations. On the other hand, the inconsistence of the results with regard to the hypothesis may equally well reflect a situation in which the hypothesis is false, and the observed effects have resulted from some other mechanism.
A second condition that limits the conclusive force of the results toward the hypothesis is the fact that it was not specified, in advance, that there might be any high-risk months or period(s) for

preovulatory overripeness. The presumption that high risk periods would be the transitional periods from those seasons with the most conceptions to those seasons with fewer conceptions (according to birth statistics) and vice versa, as proposed by Jongbloet (1992), needs further substantiation and was not included here. Further studies addressing this hypothesis should make clear whether the winter birth excess observed here is consistent over new study populations and over other manifestations of ovarian dysfunction. To our knowledge, this study is the first in which an association is found between month of birth and habitual miscarriage. Associations with month-of-birth have been described, though, for a great variety of features, among them several reproductive features such as early menarche (Jongbloet et al., 1994), menstrual disorders (Jongbloet et al., 1994), mean menstrual cycle length (Nakamura et al., 1987), twin proneness (Miura et al., 1984; Nonaka et al., 1993), and early and late menopause (Jongbloet et al., 1994).

In conclusion, this study did not demonstrate independent associations between low and high maternal age or short birth intervals on the one hand, and recurrent miscarriage in the daughter on the other hand. If the deviations in month-of-birth, as observed in this study, are real, this finding indicates that there may be(nongenetic) factors in early life, i.e., around conception or birth, that play a role inthe etiology of recurrent early pregnancy loss. Further investigations could shed more light on the role and nature of such early conditions.
