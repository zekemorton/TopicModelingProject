ABSTRACT: Accidents, injuries, and outcomes from adverse effects have been identified as the second leading cause of death for American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). However, no studies have been done which analyze violent deaths (homicides, suicides, and other accidents) for this population with a focus on time trends. For this study, overall and gender-specific mortality rates due to violent deaths were computed for 1973-88. The results indicate that overall and gender-specific mortality rates for violent deaths in AI/AN have been decreasing on average per year: homicide, 4.3%; suicide, 2.7%; other accidents, 5.6%. Similarly, age-adjusted rates have been declining, and at faster rates than those of the U.S. general population: homicide, 4.5% vs. 1.4%; suicide, 2.5% vs. 0.6%; other accidents, 6.2% vs. 2.6%. However, the male-female ratio for homicides and other accidents has remained unchanged, and the ratio for suicide has been increasing. While the gap between age-adjusted rates have been narrowing, the age-adjusted rates for AI/AN have remained consistently above those of the U.S. general population.

Violence-related mortality, and violence in general, has been identified as a major public health problem for the U.S. population (Koop and Lundber, 1992). Considerable effort has gone into establishing recommendations and guidelines to create an awareness of the possibilities for understanding and dealing with violence as a public health issue from a multidisciplinary approach (Surgeon General of the U.S., 1985).
While this issue concerns every member of our society, the professional literature has focused largely on mortality studies dealing with urban adolescents and black-white comparisons (Fingerhut et al., 1992a, 19926; Greenberg and Schneider, 1992). Little attention has focused on violent deaths within another U.S. minority

population, American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN). In general, the AI/AN population is younger than the U.S. general population, experiences an overall rate of unemployment at least 1.6 times greater than the general population, and AI/AN households are 2.3 times more likely to be at or below the poverty level (U.S. Dept of Interior, 1986).
Accidents, injuries, and outcomes from adverse effects has been identified as the second leading cause of death among this minority population, and for adolescents/young adults as the leading cause of mortality. Published reports have focused on an aggregate of accident and injury mortality (U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, 1992), or on specific accident mortality, such as motor vehicle accidents, or

on suicide and suicide attempts at a tribal or community level (Shore, 1975; May, 1990).
This study was undertaken to supplement existing knowledge on accidents and injuries for the AI/AN population, with a focus on violent deaths. Violent deaths were examined first by an evaluation of the overall and gender-specific mortality rates and then by a comparison of the ageadjusted mortality rates for the AI/AN population to the U.S. general population. The period under study covered the years 1973-1988 and violent deaths will refer to deaths resulting from homicide, suicide, or other accidents.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data used in this study were for the complete population and not samples, and mortality rates were utilized, not just numbers of deaths. The respective mortality rates for homicide, suicide, and other accidental deaths were computed from a subset of data from the National Mortality Detail File (NMDF) for 1973-88. This subset consisted of individuals who at the time of death were identified racially as either American Indian or Alaska Native.
Overall and gender-specific mortality rates were calculated for homicides (E950-E959), suicides (E960-E969) and other accidents (E800-E949, E970-E998). The numerator values were based upon mortality due to the external cause of injury and poisoning codes (E-codes), a subset of the International Classification of Disease, Clinical Modification (ICD-CM) coding system. The E-coding system classifies the environmental events, cir-

cumstances, intentionality, and conditions that cause injury, poisoning, and other adverse effects. Given the time period of the study, 1973-88, both the eighth revision (ICD-8-CM) and ninth revision (ICD-9-CM) were utilized. Concerning the issue of comparability between the two coding schemes, prior work looked at this issue in depth and concluded that for the three categories of mortality being studied there were no major problems associated with the transition from the ICD-8-CM to the ICD-9-CM (Holinger and Klemen, 1982).
The denominator data for the estimated mortality rates were the annual population estimates of AI/AN based upon the 1970 and 1980 decennial U.S. census. These yearly projections were available from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Indian Health Service (IHS), Office of Program Statistics. The population estimates reflect AI/AN living on and off reservations and are projected through linear regression techniques using birth and death data provided to the IHS from the National Center for Health Statistics.
To analyze trends across the observed mortality rates, linear regression was done on both the estimated annual mortality rates and the natural logarithm of the annual mortality rates relative to a time-trend index (Sokal and Rohlf, 1969). This technique allows for evaluating both the average absolute change and the average yearly percentage change in mortality rates. This methodology was applied to both the overall rates and the genderspecific rates.
Lastly, estimated annual overall mortality rates for homicide, suicide,

and other accidents for AI/AN were compared to the rates for the U.S. general population. For purposes of comparison, rates were age-adjusted to the U.S. population enumerated in 1940 and simplified by expressing the 1940 U.S. population on a standard million basis (National Center for Health Statistics). In addition, estimated rates for both groups were analyzed using linear regression techniques to assess both the average absolute change and the average yearly percentage change in age-adjusted mortality rates.
RESULTS
OVERALL AND GENDER-SPECIFIC RATES
Figures 1, 2, and 3 present a graphical overview of the observed behavior of the three categories of mortality. Table 1 summarizes the findings of the trend analysis done on these respective time-series. Specifically, the overall homicide mortality rates for the AI/AN population have been declining by 4.3 per cent per year on average, with males experiencing an absolute decline in rates on average by approximately 1.16 per 100,000 population per year. For both males and females, the percentage rate of decline on average per year has been comparable--4.2 per cent and 4.6 per cent respectively. Similarly, for the period under study, the overall suicide mortality rates have been declining by 2.7 per cent per year on average. For this category of mortality, females experienced a percentage rate of decline twice that of males, 4.6 per cent vs. 2.3 per cent. However, in absolute terms, the decline in the suicide mortality rate of males was twice that of females--a decline of 0.63

verses 0.31 per 100,000 population per year. Regarding the behavior of the overall mortality rates due to the allother-accidents category, there has been a decline on average by approximately 5.6 per cent per year. This decline was comparable across both genders. In the absolute change in rates on average per year, the rate of decline for males was almost three times as large as that observed for females.
Lastly, while the overall and gender-specific mortality rates for the three categories have been declining on average per year, a similar trend was not observed in the behavior of the male-to-female (M/F) ratio. Figure 4 presents a graphical representation of the observed M/F ratios for the sixteen years investigated. For the period under study, the M/F ratio for mortality due to both homicide and the all-otheraccidents category has not seen significant changes either in the absolute value or in the percentage rate of change in the value. For homicide mortality, the M/F ratio has been about 3.2 with a standard deviation of 0.51; for the all-other-accidents category, the ratio has been approximately 2.8 with a standard deviation of 0.17.
However, for suicide mortality, there has been an observed increase in the M/F ratio. Specifically, the ratio has been increasing by approximately 2 per cent on average. In absolute terms, this increase in the ratio converts to approximately 0.09 per year on average.

to violent episodes (Griffen and Bell, 1989; Baker, 1990), AI/AN are experiencing the opposite. However, while overall and gender-specific rates have been dropping and the gap has been narrowing between the age-adjusted rates, the rates for AI/AN are still consistently above the benchmark of the All U.S. population. It has been argued that the consistently higher rates in AI/AN are a unique sociological phenomenon centered around acculturation stress, potential weak family ties, and inadequate social support systems (Shore, 1975). Similarly, it could be argued that the higher rates are largely due to the AI/AN overall economic situation. Given that AI/AN are generally less educated and have higher unemployment rates, and that AI/AN households are more likely to be below the poverty level than those of the general population, AI/AN will

be more sensitive to the life stresses of economic fluctuations (Brenner, 1979) which may result in more episodes of violent behavior leading to death.
However, no matter which paradigm is used in addressing this phenomenon, the observed declining rates for AI/AN should raise questions about what is being observed. Are AI/AN becoming being more risk adverse in their behaviors or have specific programmatic changes occurred? Such inquiries can only be addressed through additional investigation and study. While most studies of the health status and conditions of AI/AN find increasing mortality and morbidity relative to the general population (U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, 1992; Newman et al., 1990; Rhoades, 1990), the results from this study go against this trend.
