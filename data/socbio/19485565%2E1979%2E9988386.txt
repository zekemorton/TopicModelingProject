ABSTRACT: Periodic regression analysis was applied to data from Fulton County, Georgia, 196777, to test for a relationship between social status and season of birth in two population groups, whites and all other races. Results suggest that for both groups seasonal variation in births tends to increase with lower social status. Proportionately more births to lower status women, especially in the all-other-races group, occured during August. Due to timing of birth, these children have a young age at entry into school which has been shown to result in poor early academic performance.

The seasonal cycle of births in the
United States has been described as a bimodal pattern with a minor peak in January-February and a major peak in AugustSeptember (Rosenberg, 1966). However, there is little information on the timing of births and social status. In other words, is the seasonal variation in births related to social status?
The answer to this question is important because Warren (1978, ms.) has shown from national survey data that children born during the major peak (August-September) have poor early academic performance relative to children born in other months because of a younger age at entry into school. Becoming aware of the potential negative effects of births in these months would be especially important for members of any social status group with a pronounced AugustSeptember peak in births.
The study reported here expands infor-

mation from previous research (Pasamanick et al., 1960; Zelnik, 1969; Chaudhury, 1972) on an association between social status and season of birth in three ways:
1. Season of birth patterns are analyzed for social status classifications within racial groups.
2. The time period is a continuous eleven year period, 1967-77.
3. The statistical technique used (periodic regression analysis) allows for significance testing of the seasonal pattern and testing for changes in the pattern over time (peak or trough shifts).

RESEARCH METHOD
In most of the reported research describing seasonal variation in live births, one of two indexing procedures was used: (1) a number index, with the

average monthly number of births fora year equaling 100.0 (Rosenberg, 1966); or (2) a percentage index with the average monthly percentage ofbirths equaling8.3 percent (Pasamanick etal., 1960;Zelnik, 1969; Chaudhury, 1972). Both methods characterize the monthly fluctuations in births as the deviation of the observed from the expected values (100.0 or8.3 per cent). Because the index methods are computed either for individual years or for summed groups ofyears, pattern changes over replicate years cannot be tested.

Also, since the data in the Baltimore studies represented a summary total over a number of years, the consistency of the pattern for each individual year was not analyzed. Therefore, some of the differences found in the studies by Pasamanick et al. (1960), Zelnik, (1969) and Chaudhury (1972) could result from an undetected year-to-year change in seasonality.

(Cowgill, 1966) compared the monthly variation in births in adjacent portions of Mexico and the United States and found different seasonal patterns.
Biological explanations are not sufficient to explain either the fact that seasonality is found in human reproduction or the differences in seasonality that occur among human population groups. In discussing the human female, Parkes (1968) has stated that he does "not know of any reliable evidence that the overt es-
