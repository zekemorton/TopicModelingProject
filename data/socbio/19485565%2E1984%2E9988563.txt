ABSTRACT: Parent-child and spouse correlations were studied in a sample of 935 Jerusalem Jewish families consisting of 935 children aged 17-18 years and their parents. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were adjusted by regression for sex, age, weight, height, and seasonality. Mother-child correlations for SBP (0.16) and DBP (0.15) were higher than those of father-child (SBP = 0.13; DBP = 0.09). Mid parent-child correlations were 0.20 for SBP and 0.14 for DBP. All parent-child correlations were statistically significant. A test for heterogeneity of parent-child correlations among the four ethnic origin groups (Europe/ America; Asia; North Africa; Israel), was not significant. Parent-child correlations for SBP and DBP were highest in the European and Asian groups, lowest in the North Africans, and intermediate in the Israeli group. Spouse correlations both for SBP and DBP were statistically not different from zero. There was no significant ethnic heterogeneity. Familial aggregation of BP was further assessed within subgroups of families according to a measure of religiosity of the head of the family. The spouse correlation for SBP differed significantly (P < 0.05) according to level of religiosity. The highest spouse correlation (0.23) was observed if the husband had five or more years of religious education, compared with correlations of 0.01 and -0.06 for 1-4 and zeroyears of religious education respectively. Spouse correlation for DBP as well as mid parentchild correlations showed a similar trend although less marked. The significantly higher spouse correlation in the religious group may be due to assortative mating, shared environmental factors (e.g. diet, smoking, exercise), shared psychosocial attributes, or a combination of these explanations. This finding requires confirmation and more detailed investigation.

The central role of blood pressure (BP) as a predictor of mortality in the Israel population (Holtzman et al., 1983; Kark et al., 1982) and elsewhere (Tyroler, 1980) has motivated study of the determinants of population blood pressure levels. Familial aggregation of blood pressure defined as the occurrence of greater similarity among relatives than among unrelated people has been frequently demonstrated (Havlik et al., 1979; Johnson et al., 1979; Hayes et al., 1971; Tyroler, 1977). Heredity, as well as common household environment, play a role in determining this familial

aggregation. Studies which compare correlation coefficients of blood pressure among first degree relatives with those who share the common family environment but are not genetically related may provide insight into the determinants of this association.
The Jerusalem Lipid Research Clinic (LRC) study provided an opportunity to examine family aggregation of blood pressure in a large sample of Jerusalem families. The adult Jewish population of Jerusalem is heterogeneous; most immigrated from numerous countries over the past 35 years. Previous studies in Is-

rael have shown that, despite marked differences among the origin groups with regard to genetic characteristics, culture, and lifestyle, no overt ethnic differences in blood pressure were observed among adults (Sive, et al., 1971).
Other than a study of familial aggregation of BP in a highly inbred Arab Population in Israel (Hurwich et al., 1982) and a study in seven-year-old siblings in Jerusalem (Palti et al., 1982),we are unaware of studies of the familial aggregation of BP in Israel. The objective of the present study was to assess the familial aggregation of blood pressure in the Jewish population of Jerusalem according to country of origin and degree of religiosity. For some origin groups, migration entailed integration into a new, Western-oriented society with changes in culture patterns reflected in diet and other health-relevant behaviors and in the quality of family relationships and traditional social functions. There are striking differences in religious observance among the Jewish population of the city accompanied by differences in social functioning and lifestyle.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The Jerusalem LRC population from which the data were obtained has been previously described (Slater et al., 1982). Briefly, 8,646 youngsters aged 17 were screened upon reporting for their medical examination prior to military service. At this initial study examination (Visit I), basic demographic information was obtained as well as data on the current use of drugs and oral contraceptive agents. A fasting blood sample was taken for determination of plasma cholesterol, triglyceride, and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (Halfon et al., 1980). No blood pressure

measurements were taken at the initial examination (Visit I) of the youngsters.
Subjects with lipid values above a certain age-specific level were invited for a second examination (Visit II) as was a 20 per cent random sample of all participants. Seventy-five per cent of eligible youngsters attended Visit II. A comparison of characteristics of those attending Visit II with nonattenders showed homogeneity of origin groups, level of education, and measurements of weight and height (Slater et al., 1982). At the Visit II examination, anthropometric measurements were made and blood pressure and pulse rate were measured. Blood pressure was measured on the right arm four times, after the participant had been sitting quietly for five minutes, twice by ordinary mercury sphygmomanometer and twice with a zero muddler according to the standard protocol used by the Lipid Research Clinics Program (1974). Systolic (SBP) and fifth phase diastolic (DBP) readings were taken. Lipids and liproproteins as well as other biochemical values were determined.
The parents of an approximately 60 per cent random sample from the Visit I youngster participants were invited for examinations (Slater etal., 1982). In all, 6,952 parents, or 72 per cent of those invited, participated. Demographic data, blood pressure, and anthropometric measurements as well as lipid determinations are available for 3,267 fathers and 3,685 mothers. A single blood pressure measurement was taken at this visit, after the participant had rested five minutes, on the right arm in the sitting position using an ordinary mercury sphygmomanometer. The present analysis is based on this reading in adults (Visit I) and for reasons of comparability, on the first measurement in young-

sters, using the ordinary mercury instrument of Visit II.
Analysis was also undertaken using the mean values of multiple readings in the youngsters to examine whether the familial correlations would be affected. Use of more than a single reading may reduce intraindividual variance and thus enhance correlations. The current analysis is confined to families consisting of at least oneparent whowasexamined at Visit I and one child whoparticipated in the Visit II examinations. Data from a total of 935 families were analyzed, 653 of which were nuclear families consisting of both parents and one offspring and 282families with one parent only.
Over 80 per cent of the examined youngsters were born in Israel. Their parents immigrated from many countries which were grouped as follows:
a) Both parents were born in Europe or in countries of emigration from Europe.
b) Both parents were born in Asia. c) Both parents were born in North Af-
rica. d) Both parents were born in Israel or
each parent in a different continent.
For families in which one of the parents was born in Israel, we used the country of origin of the grandparents in order to obtain a more refined classification of the family's origin. Groups a, b, and c tend to be more ethnically homogeneous while Group d tends to heterogeneity. Our operational definition of the degree of religiosity of the family was the number of years of religious education (Yeshiva) received by the head of *he family in addition to his formal schooling. No other information on religious observance was available. This measure was not validated against other measures of religious observance and practice, but does have high face validity.

Analyses were performed on unadjusted and adjusted blood pressure values. Variables included in analysis in addition to sex, age, origin, and years of religious education were height, weight, and an index of body mass (weight/ height2), social class (based on the occupation of the head of the family) (Slater et al., 1982), and seasonality (denned as the number of months elapsed from the first month of the year to the month of the examination on a scale ranging from 0 to 2 TT and introduced into the analyses as sine and cosine terms).
DESCRIPTION OF THE SAMPLE
Table 1presents data on age, weight, height, body mass index, and blood pressure as measured in our families. Analysis of variance indicated that fathers had significantly higher blood pressure than the mothers. Statistical testing of the variances in Table 1 showed no significant heterogeneity among parents except for Quetelet index. Boys had significantly higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) than girls. Diastolic blood pressure (DBP) did not differ significantly between boys and girls. Boys had significantly greater variance than girls for weight, Quetelet's index, and SBP.
ADJUSTMENTS AND TRANSFORMATIONS
Blood pressure levels were adjusted for known determinants. We used the multiple linear regression of blood pressure on sex, age, weight, height, and the terms modelling seasonality separately for parents and children. Regressions were performed first by fitting sex and age (for parents only); and then fitting sex, age, weight and height together; and, last, seasonality effects were also included in the regression equation. The two variables, weight and height, were

better predictors of blood pressure than Quetelet's index and were preferred in analysis. The results are summarized in Table 2. It is notable that in parents, both for SBP and DBP, the coefficient for sex was not significantly different from zero. The age effect was predominantly linear for SBP, but for DBP the quadratic term (age2) was significant, Age accounted for more than 50 per cent of the explained variance in blood pressure ascribable to all variables in the regression. The effects of weight and height were statistically significant in parents both for SBP and DBP. Season was significant for DBP only. The total contribution of these variables to the ex-

plained variability in parents was 18.2 per cent in SBP and 18.3 per cent in DBP. The effect of sex was statistically significant in children for SBP. Weight and height contributed 67per cent of the explained variance (i?2) in SBP and over 80 per cent in DBP. As found previously in parents, seasonality had a significant effect on DBP only. We used the appropriate estimated partial regression coefficients in order to adjust blood pressure values for these independent variables prior to the next step in the analyses. The adjusted SBP and DBP values were then rescaled using the logarithmic transformation in order to normalize the distributions.

We next tested the hypothesis that the coefficients for age, weight, height, and seasonal effects were similar in both sex groups. In general, the set of these coefficients was found to be homogeneous across the sex groups. However, since single independent variables were different, we undertook a sex-specific adjustment by running the multiple linear regression separately for males and for females (sex-specific adjustment). Once the best regression was determined, the residual was standardized in each sex generation group to have a mean value of zero and standard deviation of one. This standardization was achieved by subtracting the mean predicted value of the appropriate sex and generation group from the observed value and then dividing by the standard deviation of that group. A logarithmic transformation was then applied.
Table 3 presents estimates for variances, skewness, and kurtosis for adjusted values of SBP and DBP before and after the transformation. In parents most of the departure from normality

was removed, although in some cases the estimated skewness and kurtosis parameters were still significantly different from zero. In children the log,, transformation removed the skewness and the kurtosis from SBP distribution. For DBP in youngsters, untransformed values approximated the normal distribution more than the transformed and were used in analysis.
RESULTS
The simple spouse correlations for unadjusted SBP and DBP were 0.002, statistically not different from zero (Table 4). The correlations for adjusted SBP and DBP remained close to zero.
Parent-child correlations are presented in Table 4. The unadjusted correlation coefficients between mother and child for SBP (0.15) and DBP (0.13) were higher than those between father and child (0.09). Upon adjustment, both father-child and mother-child correlations for SBP and mother-child correlations for DBP showed slightly

higher values as compared with the unadjusted correlation coefficients. The father-child correlations for DBP were somewhat reduced upon adjustment, suggesting that part of the association in DBP was due to father-child similarity in height and weight. Mother-child correlations for SBP and DBP were consistently higher than those of father-child, yet these differences were not statistically significant.
The mid parent-offspring correlation for nonadjusted SBP was 0.16 and 0.20 after adjustment for the major factors.

In DBP the mid parent-offspring correlation was about 0.14 for the unadjusted as well as the adjusted values. Similar results were obtained when all these correlations were performed on transformed sex-specific adjusted values (see methods) (Table 4). Mid parent-son correlation coefficients were similar to those for mid parent-daughter after controlling for the correlated factors (Table 5).
The father-son correlation for DBP was higher than the father-daughter correlation, and the difference was en-

hanced after controlling for age, height, weight, and seasonality. The same trend was noted for mother-child associations on unadjusted data, but was reversed upon adjustment. None of these sex differences in the correlation coefficient reached conventional levels of statistical significance.
When analysis was limited to families in whom the child belonged to the random sample invited to Visit II the results were almost identical. Thus addition of the high lipid group did not bias the familial blood pressure correlations on the one hand and served to increase the sample size on the other. The analyses were repeated using the mean of the two standard mercury sphygmomanometer measurements. The observed correlations were almost identical to those based on the first reading only and described in Table 4. The father-child correlation for unadjusted SBP was 0.093, mother-child r = 0.157, and for unadjusted DBP the father-child correlations were 0.094 and the mother-child were 0.133.
When mean blood pressure values were analyzed according to the origin of the parents, European fathers tended to have the highest SBP (126.8) and DBP (82.1) levels while the lowest mean levels were recorded in the North African group (SBP, 123.5; DBP, 79.8). Asian mothers showed the highest mean values both for SBP (122.5) and DBP (78.6), but differences were less marked among the "homogeneous" origin groups. The North African male youngsters were similar to their fathers in showing the lowest mean values both for SBP (110.7) and DBP (70.9) while the highest mean values were recorded in the Israeli group (SBP, 115.8; DBP, 72.1). The rank order of mean blood pressure levels for the daughters was

similar to that of their mothers but the differences among the origin group was relatively small.
Spouse, parent-child, and mid parent-child correlations by ethnic origin are presented in Table 6. Spouse correlations for unadjusted SBP were significantly different from zero for those who were born in Europe or in Asia (0.13-0.14). After adjustment, these correlations were reduced, particularly in Europeans, and were not significantly different from zero. For DBP, spouse correlations were almost zero with unadjusted measures, and none were significant after adjustment. Both for adjusted SBP and DBP the highest positive spouse correlations were observed in the Asian group (0.09-0.10) and the greatest negative correlation coefficients were in the North African group (-0.14 to -0.16). Nevertheless a test for heterogeneity in spouse correlations among the four origin groups revealed no significant differences (xfo -- 4.16 for SBP and 4.05 for DBP).
The parent-child correlations for adjusted blood pressure demonstrated the following pattern within the origin groups. In each of the European and the Asian groups three out of the four parent-child correlations (mother-child, father-child for SBP and DBP) were relatively high (r = 0.20). In the North African group the opposite was observed, and three out of four parentchild correlation coefficients were relatively small (0.03-0.10). The Israeli group showed intermediate results, with one small, one relatively high, and two modest parent-child correlations in the range of 0.10-0.13. These ethnic differences in associations were not statistically significant.

ial aggregation of blood pressure, spouse andmidparent-child correlations were assessed within three subgroups of families according to the years of religious education of the head of the family before and after controlling for thecorrelated variables (Table 7). The SBP spouse correlation in families whose fathers have had 5 years or more of religious education was 0.30, compared

with correlation of 0.03 in a group of families in which the head of the family had 1-4 years of religious education and 0.02 in families with fathers whodid not have any religious education. This difference remained significant (*2(2) = 6.15) even after controlling for potentially confounding variables, which tended to reduce spouse correlations in the three groups. The spouse correla-

Ward et al., 1979). Only a small fraction of the association in blood pressure appeared to be caused by similarity or dissimilarity in age, height, weight, and seasonality. Results from a study on familial aggregation in a highly inbred Arab community near Jerusalem (Abu Gosh) revealed father-child SBP and DBP correlations ranging from 0.12 to 0.15, similar to those observed by us (Hurwich et al., 1982). However, their mother-child correlation was smaller than ours and statistically not different from zero.
Our significant parent-child correlation which appears to be uniform in the various sex combinations (except for father-daughter DBP correlation), after the correction for the known blood pressure correlates available in our data set, suggests either an independent genetic effect or the effect of undefined additional shared environmental factors. Different studies, using various methods, attempted to quantify the relative importance of the genetic component of variation in blood pressure. Focusing upon twin and sib similarities and the difference between (positive) parentchild correlations and (absent) spousespouse blood pressure associations, their results are consistent with a genetic contribution to the aggregation of blood pressure among biologic relatives.
In many studies the relationship between spouses has been examined since they share the same household environment but generally are not genetically related. Several studies have suggested that some environmental factors are reflected in blood pressure correlation since spouse correlation was found to be a function of duration of marriage (Hayes et al., 1971; Chazan and Winkelstein, 1964; Winkelstein et al., 1966). Many other studies showed conflicting

results (Gearing et al., 1962;Miall et al., 1967; Schull et al., 1977). Sackett (1975), while reviewing this controversy, suggested that spouse concordance in blood pressure does exist, since in many cross-sectional studies the observed low correlation attained statistical significance. Further evaluation of spouse correlations of blood pressure revealed that after adjustment for age, weight, and other correlates only a small correlation remained (Feinleib et al., 1970). Data on spouse longitudinal relationship of blood pressure have shown no major changes over time (Sackett et al., 1975), and the explanation for the small correlation in spouses is attributable more to assortative mating and less to shared household environment.
Our data failed to detect evidence of spouse aggregation in SBP and DBP, even prior to adjustment for age, weight, and other correlates, except in the most religious group. Since no data were available with regard to the duration of marriage, and the children of the couples were at least 17years old, we assumed that the length of marriage in our population is positively associated with the age of the mother; no consistent changes in spouse correlation were observed with increasing age of mother. Simple comparison of the low but consistent correlation between biologic relatives with the lack of association between spouses suggests that genetic factors may be of greater importance than shared environment in this population. Others, who utilized more appropriate models, estimated the fraction of the phenotypic variability attributable to genetic factors between 0.24 and 0.34 for SBP and 0.18-0.30 for DBP (Ward et al., 1979; Annest et al., 1979; Morton et al., 1980). Nonconclusive results emerged when the relative fraction of

Previous studies of blood pressure pattern in the adult Israeli population revealed no definite ethnic differences (Sive et al., 1971). However, in youngsters (Kark 1977; Epstein et al., 1981; Lewis et al., 1982), including the Jerusalem LRC data, ethnic differences are evident. In other populations differences
