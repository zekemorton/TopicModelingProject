ABSTRACT: The five leading causes of death for Navajo males and females are analyzed by life table methods. Navajo male and female life expectancy at birth were 58.8 and 71.8 years, respectively. The greatest increase in Navajo male life expectancy would result from the elimination of motor vehicle accidents (5.17 years at birth, and 3.11 years for working ages 15-65). The life expectancy of Navajo females would be lengthened the most (3.70 years) by elimination of circulatory system disease. For working-ages gains for both sexes, however, the greatest benefit would result from elimination of motor vehicle accidents. The implications of the results are discussed in relation to the various public health programs and health planning efforts for the Navajo Nation.

The Navajo Nation is an American Indian tribe whose reservation is located in the states of Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. They are the largest tribe, and as such their mortality experience may be used to estimate the experience of other tribes. The purpose of this study is to ascertain the effect of leading causes of death on Navajo male and female life expectancy.
The territory which the Navajo tribe commands comprises approximately 25,000 square miles or one-fifth of all Indian lands and is comparable in size to the state of West Virginia. Additional land under Navajo control includes the Checkerboard area of New Mexico, a patchwork of deeded land in San Juan and McKinley counties. The Navajo Reservation is situated on the high semiarid Colorado plateau with an average elevation of 6,000 feet. Much of the land is inaccessible, except by foot or horseback, and weather conditions frequently make unimproved roads impassable. Of the reservation's approximately 5,000 miles of

road, only 1,500 are paved (only 40 per cent as much surfaced road per square mile as the rest of the Southwest). There is no public transportation system.
The mortality experience of the Navajos in modern times is molded in great part by the actions of the U.S. federal government. Beginning with interactions with U.S. cavalry and settlers in the early nineteenth century and continuing with the Bureau of Indian Affairs into the first half of this century, the Navajos have not advanced as far as their nonreservation counterparts in lengthening life expectancy or lessening the effects of disease. Significant gains, however, have occurred since 19SS when the Indian Health Service took over health care delivery on the reservation. The crude death rate for all Indians dropped from 927.2/100,000 in 19SS to 771.7 in 1971 (Indian Health Service, 1974). In many ways the Navajo Reservation is similar to a developing country. The population is young (the median age is 17 years) and still in the throes of the demographic transition to lower

RESULTS
The life tables developed for the Navajo male and female populations showed a marked difference in life expectancy between the two groups. Male life expectancy at birth and at age one were 58.8 years and 59.6 years, respectively, while the values for Navajo females were 71.8 years and 72.4 years. Comparison of these figures with other U.S. population groups is made in Table 1. Life expectancy for Navajo males is appreciably lower than for all other groups at both ages, while that for Navajo females exceeds all but that of the U.S. white female at these ages. This difference is consistent with the marked male/female difference in mortality rates. The male crude death rate was 7.5 in 1974 compared with the female rate of 3.6 (Indian Health Service, 1976).
When the entire Navajo population is considered, the life expectancy (64.9 years at birth) is not significantly different from that for all Indians combined, including Alaska natives, in 1970. This finding would indicate that the method and basic

data used are reasonable to reflect the general consistency, recognizing that the Navajo, as the largest Indian tribe, contribute significantly to the all-Indian figure. The minor inconsistency may be due to the difference in population characteristics. The Navajo population is predominantly rural and is younger than the all-Indian population which includes a substantial number of urban Indians. It is, of course, assumed that significant improvements or decrements in Navajo health or health care delivery did not occur in the interim (1970-73).
The median length of life, as derived from the life tables, shows that the Navajo male and the U.S. nonwhite male have the lowest median length of life (62.1 and 66.4 years, respectively), while the Navajo female has a median length of life intermediate between the U.S. white and nonwhite females. The Navajo male has only a 46 per cent probability of surviving at age 70, half that of the U.S. white female and three-fourths that of the U.S. white male. Similar patterns are reflected in life expectancy figures.

al., 1976). Clearly then, the Navajos do not present a mortality and survivorship picture typical of the modernized Western world.
DISCUSSION
The Navajo population presents an age structure and mortality experience markedly different from that of the remainder of the U.S. population, resembling in many ways that of a developing country. Most striking among the evidence presented here was the difference in male and female mortality and the resultant effect upon survivorship. Navajo male life expectancy is approximately that of the white male in 1928-31 (National Center for Health Statistics, 1976) which represents a lag of 45 years. The Navajo female is experiencing a life expectancy similar to that of the white female of 25 years ago

(1949-51). Contributing significantly to the lowered life expectancy for both males and females are motor vehicle accidents, especially for working ages, and cardiovascular disease. The crude death rate from motor vehicle accidents rose from 50.3 (per 100,000) in 1966-67 (Brown et al., 1970) to 115.8 in 1974 (Indian Health Service, 1976). Intervention strategies aimed at reducing mortality due to auto accidents should include: a mass media campaign on the hazards of speed and driving while intoxicated; a reservationwide automobile safety inspection program (the state of Arizona has such a program but not on the reservation); improvement of the emergency medical system; and various health and safety education programs.
Auto accidents and alcoholism are examples of manifestations that are primarily behaviorally related. Certainly the

286

prevalence of alcohol-related deaths reflects a need for alcoholism programs. Paradoxically, the effects of alcoholism and alcohol abuse may be addressed by legislation of alcohol on the reservation. The high proportion of alcohol-related deaths and alcoholism indicates that prohibition has had little or no beneficial effect on morbidity or mortality. Previous studies on other reservations have shown that once use of alcohol can be socially accepted and managed, alcohol abuse will drop (May, 1976). Certainly, alcohol legalization can affect arrests, which can be viewed as indicative of social ills (May, 1975). An added incentive is the tax revenue which the tribe could receive and use to fund alcoholism and behavioral health programs.
The infective and parasitic diseases still play an important role in Navajo female mortality. Although this category of diseases does not appear in the five leading causes for Navajo males, it is still playing an important role (seventh leading cause). Contributing factors to this category of diseases may include sanitation (perhaps the single most important factor relating to infectious disease), poor housing, malnutrition, and behavior. The coupling of poor overcrowded housing with a lack of sanitation facilities, running water, and electricity plays a dominant role in the prevalence of environmentally related disease. Malnutrition exacerbates conditions not normally fatal in the U.S. general population. Over a four-year period (1972-75), 46 per cent of all malnutrition cases diagnosed were in the 0-4 age group, which also experienced a high infectious disease mortality rate (Kaltenbach, 1976).
Existence of the U.S. circulatory system disease pattern is primarily due to lack of awareness of currently recognized risk factors (smoking, hypertension, diet) and could be affected by proper health education and screening procedures. Prevention

of rheumatic heart disease by streptococcal disease surveillance is presently being attempted by the Tribal Streptococcal Disease Control Program. Mortality due to all other accidents could be reduced by providing quicker emergency services, although the shift of the male population from isolated rural occupations to concentrated "urban" ones should have a beneficial effect. Cancer mortality could be reduced by increasing public awareness of the importance of early diagnosis and treatment, of the signs and symptoms of cancer, and by the provision of detection, treatment, and follow-up services. The need most common to the majority of these intervention approaches is an extended health education program. Difficulties which must be overcome in the provision of health education to this population are that many persons do not read English or Navajo (until recently only a spoken language) and a significant number do not speak more than a few words of basic English.
In health planning, it is important to consider the effect of population age composition and its interrelationship with mortality because funds available for intervention are limited. Consideration of the differing effects of causes of death on measures of survivorship can provide additional information in the planning of and the assigning of priorities to health services. The study has shown that data of uncertain accuracy can provide valuable information on the mortality experience of a population if used with reference to previous studies and only until reliable data is available.
