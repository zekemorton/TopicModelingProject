ABSTRACT:Violent crimes committed during two to three consecutive years in sixteen different locations in the United States were examined for annual rhythms using the cosinor method of analysis. Annual changes in rapes and in the more numerous aggravated assaults were highly significant in the majority of locations. They were closely related to each other in time and showed maxima generally between July and August. The data suggest that rape may comprise a subpopulation of assaultive behavior. In contrast, there were seasonal rhythms for robbery in only five locations with maxima between November and December. There was a virtual absence of any seasonal changes in murder. A close statistical association was established between annual assault and rape rhythms and annual temperature fluctuations in the different locations. This finding suggested that certain aspects of human violence may be influenced by exteroceptive factors.

seasonal effects on plasma androgen levels and sexual activity in men (Smals et al., 1976; Reinberg and Lagoguey, 1978). Other seasonal effects include those on conceptions (Ronnike, 1981), births (James, 1971; Parker, 1978; Sandahl, 1978; Warren and Tyler, 1979; Kenny and Ritter, 1981), menarche (Brundtland and Liestol, 1982), menstrual cycle length (Sundararaj et al., 1978), the diurnal timing of the ovulatory LH surge (Testart, Frydman and Roger, 1982), and on affective disorders (Meares, Mendelsohn and Milgromfriedman, 1981; Parker and Walter, 1982).
However, it is the data base provided by the criminal statistics of nineteenthcentury pre-industrial Europe that gives the clearest indication of seasonal effects on human aggressive and sexual behavior. In the 1840's, Adolphe Quetelet, the father of "moral statistics," wrote to the Grand Duke of SaxeCoburg and Gotha:
Who does not know that the severities of winter, by multiplying wants, cause insociety a greater number of crimes against property, while they deaden the passions, which again wake with more ardour and danger at the return of the spring, and during the heats of summer? It is then that we see acts of violence break out, that revolt is organized and spread with more rapidity--that our intelligence, too ready to exalt itself, overleaps the last limits of reason.
The studies of Quetelet and of other nineteenth century authorities (Quetelet, 1849; Aschaffenburg, 1913; Ferri, 1917; Lombroso, 1918) led to the formulation of the "thermic law of crime," which held that crimes against the person (e.g., murder, assault, rape, rebellion) increased, while crimes against property (e.g., robbery, burglary, theft, larceny) decreased, with seasonal and

geographical increases in temperature. Then and now, opinions have been divided as to whether seasonal factors act directly, for example, by increasing peoples' "irritability" and "vitality," or indirectly, for example, by changing the frequency of social interactions (work and vacation schedules, employment levels, clothing) and the intensity of economic hardship.
Either way, in view of the profound technological, demographic, and economic changes that have occurred in the last hundred years, it might be expected that seasonal influences on crime would either be considerably reduced or entirely obliterated in the modern United States. In fact, law enforcement and rape crisis center personnel are acutely aware of the summer increases in assaults and rapes, and more recent publications have made similar comments (von Hentig, 1948; Falk, 1952; Amir, 1971; Hayman et al., 1972).
However, these studies have used few sample areas and either failed to test the significance of any annual changes in crime rates or found none. Hence, it has not been possible to make a valid assessment of the relationship between crime rates and differences in exteroceptive factors in different geographical locations. The present study was therefore undertaken to assess the significance of seasonal changes in assaults, rapes, robberies, and murders in a number of different locations in the United States and to relate them both to each other and to seasonal and geographical differences in temperature and photoperiod.

mean (amplitude). For the purpose of generating calendar dates, mean monthly data were assumed to originate from the middle of each month. The computer program (Dixon, 1974) gave information about several other parameters, including changes in the annual means, amplitudes, and acrophases, but these are not reported here. Monthly temperature means were also analyzed by the cosinor method for each of the sixteen locations using the same computer program. The Spearman rank order correlation coefficient one-tailed, using both raw data and those generated by the cosine curves, was employed to test the significance of relationships between different crimes of violence, latitude, and temperature. Certain relationships were further examined by calculating regressions using the method of least squares.
RESULTS
DATA FROM NINETEENTH CENTURY
EUROPE
Some examples of the data from nineteenth-century criminal statistics which led to the formulation of the "thermic law of crime" are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. Figure 1 gives the percentage changes about the annual mean for two categories of crime against the person (left panels) and for two categories of crime against property (right panels) listed in the "Statistics of the German Empire" as reported by Aschaffenburg (1913). Data are from the years 1883-92, and results are corrected for inequalities in the lengths of different months.
Both assaults and rapes showed wellmarked annual rhythms. There were

gradual increases to peaks in July (rapes) and August (assaults), which were between 36 per cent (assaults) and 50 per cent (rapes) higher than the annual means, followed by a gradual decline to winter minima. In contrast, fraud and petit larceny remained lower than average throughout spring, summer, and autumn but rose to about 20 per cent above the annual mean between November and February. Not only were the patterns for these latter crimes less sinusoidal in shape and of lower amplitude, but the annual peaks occurred about 4-5 months later than those in assaults and rapes.
Figure 2 gives data for rapes during 1834-56 in England and during 1829-60 in France as reported by Lombroso (1918), and for sexual crimes against adults and against children in France during 1827-69 as reported by Aschaffenburg (1913). Here a monthly mean was expressed as a percentage of the annual total. In every case, there were marked annual rhythms with maxima between June-July. The annual rape peak in England was rather lower (about 25 per cent above average) than sexual crime peaks in both France (more than 50 per cent above average) and Germany (Fig. 1).
Because these old data are not given in a form suitable for rhythm analysis, namely, as monthly totals for individual years, it is not possible to evaluate probability levels. However, there can be little doubt that these highly consistent seasonal rhythms in assaults, rapes, and sexual crimes, with annual fluctuations often in excess of 100per cent, are statistically significant. It was therefore of considerable interest to us to examine if crimes of violence in the modern United States showed any statistically significant annual rhythms, and to relate

a significant F ratio for scatter indicated that the cosine curve did not adequately describe the data. This reduces the number of significant rhythms to 5 of 16locations. The maxima in robberies occurred between November and December. The annual rhythm in murder was significant in only 1 of 16 locations. Thus, in the majority of these locations in the modern United States, there was a much greater probability of aggravated assaults and rapes occurring in the summer than in the winter, and this was dif-

ferent from the situation for robbery and murder.
Relationships Between the Different Types of Violence
The rhythm-adjusted maxima for assaults and rapes generally occurred within an eight-week period between July 7 and September 8. Although it is well-recognized that the occurrence of rapes is frequently under-reported, it is unlikely this would vary systematically

with season. In contrast, robberies tended to peak within a seven-week period between November 2 and December 22, while maxima for murders were scattered throughout the year. The close temporal relation between the changes in aggravated assaults and rapes became more clear when the rhythm-adjusted

maxima (amplitudes), expressed as percentage changes with respect to the annual means, were plotted against the dates on which they occurred (acrophases) (Fig. 3).
Using the data from all 16 locations, regardless of the significance or otherwise of the rhythms, we found a positive

correlation between the dates of the maxima for assaults and rapes (acrophases) (Spearman rank order correlation coefficient, rj = 0.58, p < 0.025). Thus, in a location where assaults peaked earlier rather than later in the summer, rapes were likely to do the same; indeed, the maxima in assaults preceded those in rapes in 11 of 16 locations (Table 1). There was also a positive correlation between the amplitudes of the annualfluctuationsin assaults and rapes (^ = 0.71, p < 0.005). Thus, the greater the magnitude of the annual change in assaults, the greater the magnitude of the annual change in rapes. Because of the close temporal relationships between the maxima in assaults and rapes, and in the magnitude of the annual fluctuations, together with the fact that rapes are invariably less numer-

ous than assaults, we postulate that rapes comprise a sub-population of assaultive behavior.
Relationships Between HumanViolence and Annual Temperature Rhythms
The summer maxima for assaults and rapes suggested the possible influence of exteroceptive factors, particularly because these characteristics were not shared by the two other types of violence. Table 2 gives for each location the annual mean temperature, the date of the temperature maximum, and the percentage increase over the mean annual temperature; again, these data are generated by the cosine functions. Annual temperature rhythms were highly significant (p < 0.001) in all locations, and there were positive associations between the annual temperature rhythms

There were no similar relations between temperature and robbery or murder. These associations appeared to indicate that the timing and magnitude of the annual changes in as-

saults and rapes in the modern United States, but not those in robberies and murders, are influenced by the annual temperature rhythms (or the behavior and temperature changes are influenced by some common factor), since it would be difficult to conceptualize a mechanism by which the behavioral changes could influence temperature.

The highly significant slope for assault on temperature (0.30 ± 0.06) was almost identical to that for rape on temperature (0.32 ± 0.08). Thus, locations with larger annual temperature changes have larger annual changes in assaults and rapes. There were no comparable associations between temperature and either robbery or murder.

acrophase doe not, of course, imply any causality.
No effect of photoperiod could be demonstrated, but significant positive correlations emerged between both the timing and the magnitude of the annual changes in temperature and those in assaults and rapes. These associations held within the majority of individual locations and also when comparisons were made between locations. Thus, the relation between behavior and temperature is on a rather firm basis. Since the changes in photoperiod and temperature tend to covary, it is difficult to separate their effects, and the effect due to temperature may have obscured that due to photoperiod.
It is generally assumed that, as summer approaches, there are increased opportunities for social interactions and that, as a consequence, crimes against the person will inevitably increase. This view received support from the fact that assaults and rapes were maximal in the summer months, but not from the finding that assault and rape rates, corrected for population, showed no increases with increasing annual mean temperatures as one proceeds south. In contrast, murder exhibited no summer maxima, yet murder rate was significantly and positively corelated with annual mean temperature, indicating that murders, when corrected for population, tend to be more frequent in warmer than in colder climates. Human violence in the modern United States does not therefore conform strictly to the "thermic law of crime."
Despite the profound technological, demographic, religious, and economic changes that have taken place since the nineteenth-century in Europe, assaults and rapes continue to show highly significant seasonal rhythms, from which we adduce that the mechanisms respon-

sible may depend as much on biological factors as on social or cultural ones. This hypothesis, namely, that exteroceptive factors may act via neuroendocrine pathways in the human to exert an influence on behavior is consistent with their known role in socially-living nonhuman primates (Van Horn, 1980) that show increased aggressivity at the start of the mating season (Henzi and Lucas, 1980; Eaton et al., 1981; Michael and Zumpe, 1981a, 1981&). It is not necessary to make any assumptions about homologies between sexual aggression by male monkeys and rape by men (they are clearly different phenomena) in order to appreciate the relevance of comparative studies on the timing of longterm behavioral rhythms.
In several nonhuman primate species, the seasonal changes in behavior are associated with increased testicular size and elevated testosterone levels (Coe and Rosenblum, 1978; Glick, 1979; Nigi et al., 1980), and evidence is now accumulating for annual rhythms in endocrine function and behavior in the human. To our knowledge, the possibility of there being larger seasonal changes in the plasma testosterone of violent and assaultive men has not as yet been investigated. The data reported here raise the fascinating possibility that neuroendocrine mechanisms may play a role in certain aspects of the social (and anti-social) behavior of our own species.
