It has been shown that maternal mental illness, in particular, schizophrenia, increases the risk of mental illness in the children (Rieder, 1973; Garmezy, 1974a, 19746). One explanation for this greater risk (Rosenthai, 1971) is that schizophrenic mothers have greater difficulty with pregnancy and childbirth, so that their children encounter a greater number of perinatal complications, including lower birth weight, factors which are related to the subsequent development of neurological deficits (Corah, 1965; Pasamanick and Knobloch, 1966; Knobloch and Pasamanick, 1962; Sameroff and Zax, 19736) as well as to the subsequent development of psychiatric disorders (Lilienfield et al., 1955; Pollack and Woerner, 1966; Woerner et al., 1973; Pollin and Stabenau, 1968; Mednick et al., 1971). The present paper reviews the current status of this hypothesis concerning an

association between maternal mental illness and the presence of pregnancy and birth complications (PBCs)1 and reports additional data relevant to this hypothesis, based on groups of schizophrenic, depressed, and well mothers and their children.
Using a design in which mothers of newborn children and their offspring are contrasted with nonschizophrenic (well) mothers and infants, conflicting results have been reported concerning the role of maternal mental illness in determining PBCs. On the one hand, using largely Black lower lower-class groups of mothers and infants, Wiedorn (1954) reports a significantly greater amount of pre-eclampsia and eclampsia among schizophrenic mothers, while Schacter (quoted in Garmezy, 19746), also using lower lower-class Black schizo-

phrenic and nonschizophrenic control groups, reports a significantly greater number of PBCs among the infants of schizophrenic mothers.
Paffenbarger et al. (1961), Paffenbarger and McCabe (1966), and Mednick and Schulsinger (1968) had reported a greater number of PBCs among schizophrenic mothers and their infants than among control mother-infant pairs. However, subsequent study by Mednick et al. (1971, 1973) of a larger sample of schizophrenic and well mothers and infants did not show this group difference. Mednick (1970) and his colleagues do report that in considering PBCs among schizophrenic mothers and their now adolescent offspring (approximately half of whom had also developed mental illness), they found 70 per cent of the schizophrenic mother-disturbed offspring pairs had earlier been characterized as having at least one PBC, as contrasted with IS per cent of the schizophrenic mother-well offspring pairs and 33 per cent of the well mother-well offspring pairs. This finding suggests that PBCs are among the factors contributing to increased vulnerability among those children of mentally ill mothers who themselves also eventually succumb to mental illness.
Other research (Maura, 1971; McNeil and Kaij, 1973, 1974; Sameroff and Zax, 1973a), typically comparing the number of PBCs shown by schizophrenic motherinfant pairs as contrasted with those shown by mentally ill but not schizophrenic mother-child pairs and well mother-child pairs, has shown little relationship between maternal mental illness and the presence of PBCs. Sameroff and Zax's study (1973a) does suggest that, within patient groups, the more severe (chronic) the mother's disturbance, the greater the number of PBCs. These authors suggest that the greater anxiety and decreased personal competence which characterize chronically

psychotic mothers, regardless of diagnostic category, interfere with such normal biological processes as childbirth.
While most studies have used the number of PBCs as a measure of the extent to which childbirth was hazardous for the child, several studies have also employed birth weight as a measure. Kallmann (1938), Sobel (1961), Paffenbarger and McCabe (1966), and Mednick et al. (1971, 1973) have all reported that the birth weight of children born to schizophrenic (psychotic) mothers was lower than that of controls. Lane and Albee (1970) examined the birth weight of several hundred infants born to schizophrenic and normal parents and reported that no such group differences in birth weight were found. Similar negative results have been reported by McNeil and Kaij (1973).
In addition to the results reported by Mednick's research group (1968, 1970), Reider et al. (1975) report a significantly greater number of fetal and neonatal deaths among offspring of schizophrenic mothers as contrasted with offspring of well controls. Since much of the interest at present is in the role of schizophrenia as a determinant of PBCs, the most appropriate comparative design is that employing matched groups of schizophrenic, psychotic but not schizophrenic, and well mothers and their children.
Since maternal age, sex of offspring2, and number of previous pregnancies have all been shown to be positively associated with a greater number of PBCs (Pasamanick and Knobloch, 1966; Maura, 1971), it is important that patient and nonpatient groups be equated on such factors. Only the recent report of McNeil and Kaij (1974) appears to employ such a design. In addition, when considering differences within the several diagnostic groups, it is

important to separate the effects due to chronicity or severity of illness from diagnosis and to determine the extent to which there is an interaction between these factors in the report of a greater number of PBCs. This interaction has not been examined systematically in prior research on PBCs.
Based on this review of the literature, we can formulate two specific hypotheses for empirical study: (1) There will be no group differences either in the number of PBCs or in the birth weight of the children of schizophrenic, depressed, or well mothers. (2) Within the patient group, there will be an interaction between diagnosis and chronicity of disturbance in determining the number of PBCs, with chronic schizophrenic mother-child pairs experiencing the greater number of PBCs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
THE GROUPS
The data were taken from a larger study in which intensive nursing aftercare was provided for psychotic mothers with young children following the mother's discharge from a psychiatric hospital (Grunebaum et al., 1971, 1974; Hartman et al, 1973). The goal of the intervention study was to help these mothers to function more effectively in their adult role and to prevent rehospitalization by providing supportive home treatment.
Women hospitalized for mental illness following childbirth were originally referred to the aftercare project by state or private mental hospitals in the greater Boston area. Over the course of two years, forty-two mothers were recruited for the present study, comprising nearly all those referrals who were married, with intact families, who had a diagnosis of psychosis, at least one child below age five, and information available regarding all previous pregnancies and deliveries. These former patients may be described as a group of chronically inade-

quate women with a poor premorbid history, numerous prior hospitalizations, and extended periods of stay during each hospitalization. According to the formal diagnosis, approximately two-thirds of these patients showed schizophrenic or schizoaffective psychoses, with one-third showing manic-depressive or depressive psychoses.
The forty-four nonhospitalized well women were recruited by means of newspaper advertisements. Previous research with this means of obtaining a sample (Cohler et al., 1968) has shown that relatively few differences appear between subjects volunteering in this manner and other samples of young adult women. Initially, mentally ill mothers were matched with nonpsychiatric controls on the basis of the husband's occupation, wife's occupation, age, parity, religion (Catholic vs. nonCatholic) , and age and sex of the youngest child. In the later stages of the study, when it proved difficult to obtain individually matched controls, well mothers were selected in order to equate the groups overall on these social background variables.
Demographically, these two groups are quite homogeneous. The typical husband in each group has at least some education beyond high school and works either as a clerk or salesman (patients), or as a clerk, small businessman, or lower-echelon professional (controls). On the basis of occupation and education, these men can be described as middle class. The typical wife also had some additional schooling beyond high school.
Most of the families in each group included at least two other children. At the time the children were tested, their ages ranged between fifty-nine and seventyeight months. The "index" child was identified at the beginning of the study as the child whose birth preceded the mother's most recent hospitalization.

THE MEASURES
Measurement of pregnancy and birth complications.--Following a mother's permission for us to obtain medical records, photocopies of hospital charts were collected for the deliveries of the index child and all brothers and sisters. These photocopies of the obstetrical charts were then coded using a four-point scale described by Mednick et al. (1971). Data recorded for subsequent analysis included the number of PBCs recorded for each birth, the sum

of the rating on the four-point scale of the
severity of each complication, and the
highest rating or most serious complication
reported for that birth. The child's birth weight was also recorded.3 The rating scale
is presented in Table 1. The measures se-
lected for final analysis included the mean
3 While, as Maura (1971) notes, it is advisable to distinguish between complications associated with pregnancy and delivery and those associated with the child's neonatal status, the very small number of total pregnancy and birth complications among all mother-infant pairs in the study made is impossible to make this distinction.

MATERNAL PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSIS
Each of the formerly hospitalized mothers was seen individually by two psychiatrists who determined the patient's diagnosis and evaluated her probable prognosis for recovery.4 After determining that a former patient had experienced a psychotic disturbance, the exact psychiatric diagnosis was established. It was particularly important that the denning characteristics of schizophrenia be clearly specified. The diagnostic classification scheme devised by Wender in Kety et al. (1968) was used for this purpose with a two-stage process involving the differentiation between other psychotic disturbances and schizophrenia and, within the group of mothers classified as schizophrenic, differentiation between acute and chronic schizophrenia. On the basis of previous work by Vaillant (1962, 1964) and Nuttall and Solomon (1965), ratings were also made on a number of dichotomous variables that had been shown to be related to good prognosis and a total prognosis score was obtained. These variables included: presence of depressive heredity, evidence of depressive symptoms at the time of hospitalization, evidence of discrete life events precipitating the illness, onset of symptoms within six months immediately prior to hospitalization, absence of a withdrawn-schizoid adjustment prior to hospitalization, and evidence of cognitive confusion at the time of hospitalization.
Data was also obtained from the patient and from hospital records regarding other aspects of treatment, including the number of hospitalizations and the number of days

ever hospitalized. On the basis of this interview and record information, each patient was rated on the overall chronicity of her illness. Interjudge agreement of at least 91 per cent was obtained between two independent clinicians for each of these ratings, and discrepancies between the two independent raters were resolved by conference.
REQUESTS AND DISCUSSION
The first step in the analysis was to determine the relationship between the measures of PBCs employed in the study. The correlations among these measures and between these measures and demographic factors are presented separately for patients and controls in Table 2. For mentally ill mothers, these dimensions are relatively independent of each other, and demographic factors are associated only with PBCs related to previous pregnancies. However, for the well controls, significant correlations are found between the presence of PBCs for both previous and present pregnancies and, as was true for patients, there is a relationship between the number of prior pregnancies and the number of PBCs during these pregnancies.
COMPARISON OF MENTALLY ILL AND WELL GROUPS
The first hypothesis states that patient and nonpatient groups will not differ in the mean number of PBCs recorded, either for previous pregnancies or for that of the index offspring. Data concerning this hypothesis are presented in Table 3. In contrast to other studies of birth complications among patient and nonpatient groups, which typically employ t-test comparisons among all possible groups and thereby inflate the probability of finding group differences, the present report employs the more conservative one-way analysis of variance. Using this procedure, it is appropriate to examine

intergroup differences only for those variables where overall differences have been found at conventional levels of statistical significance.
Using this more conservative statistical test, the two patient and the nonpatient groups are well equated on the three demographic factors that are related to the development of PBCs and the three groups do not differ on the number of PBCs.

It is possible that, within each of these three groups, those children who subsequently show psychiatric symptoms may be found to differ from their well counterparts in terms of a greater number of PBCs. However, based on "blind" independent psychiatric evaluations, among the group of forty-two psychotic mothers and their children for whom there is relevant data, only two (4 per cent) show some

psychiatric symptoms, and only three of the forty-four index children of nonhospitalized controls (7 per cent) show psychiatric symptoms; at the present time, these few disturbed young children cannot be differentiated from their peers on the basis of PBCs.
The data in Table 2, while based on a small number of cases, indicate that maternal mental illness does not appear to lead to an increase in the number of PBCs. However, there is an additional way of examining this question. Mednick (1970) reanalyzed his earlier birth complication data (Mednick and Schlusinger, 1968), using the criterion of one or more PBCs as an index of difficulty in childbirth. Using this index, Mednick found that 70 per cent of the children in his group of mentally ill youngsters of schizophrenic mothers experienced difficulty during pregnancy and delivery, as contrasted with IS per cent of the well children of schizophrenic mothers and 33 per cent of the children of normal mothers. Using this criterion for determining birth difficulty, our data show that, considering all prior pregnancies, 37 per cent of schizophrenic mother-child pairs had experienced PBCs as contrasted with 28 per cent of psychotic depressed motherchild pairs and 22 per cent of well motherchild pairs. The association between diagnostic group and presence of PBCs does not begin to approach significance (chisquare equals 1.83 with 6 degrees of freedom) showing that there is no greater risk of PBCs among schizophrenic mothers than among depressed or normal mothers.
Similar findings emerge when considering the number of PBCs recorded for the index child. Among index children of schizophrenic mothers, 37 per cent experienced one or more PBCs as compared with 21 per cent of the index children of depressed mothers and 27 per cent of the index children of nonhospitalized controls. The association between diagnostic group

and presence of birth complications for the index child was not significant (chi-square equals 1.2S with 6 degrees of freedom). On the basis of the criterion of one or more PBCs, it is again clear that, overall, mentally ill mother-child pairs are no more likely than well pairs to show PBCs.
DIAGNOSIS, CHRONICITY, AND PREGNANCY AND BIRTH COMPLICATIONS
The second hypothesis predicts an interaction between diagnostic group and chronicity of the mother's disturbance in determining the number of PBCs. Specifically, it is expected that the greatest number of PBCs would be found among chronic schizophrenic mother-child pairs. While the number of mothers within each group was rather small, it was possible to employ a two-way analysis of variance, with diagnostic group (schizophrenic vs. depressed) and chronicity (acute vs. chronic) as the independent variables.5 It should be noted that there is little association between these two variables (chi-square equals 0.01 with 6 degrees of freedom). Since there was an interaction effect for the number of prior pregnancies significant at close to the conventional 0.05 significance level, with the acute depressed mothers having had a somewhat larger number of pregnancies, the analysis-of-variance employed a covariance adjustment for number of prior births. This data is presented in Table 4.
Even when adjusted for number of previous births, there is an interaction between chronicity of illness and diagnostic category in the number of PBCs, but in the opposite direction from that which we had expected. For all prior births excluding the present (index) child's birth, acutely depressed mothers show the greatest mean number of PBCs. However, considering the index child, it is the acute schizophrenic motherinfant pairs who show the greatest number
5 Diagnostic information on one mother was incomplete; thus, only 41 of the 42 mentally ill mothers are included in the analysis.

of PBCs. These results suggest that, in the case of both present and past births, it is the children of acute rather than chronic mothers who are at greatest risk. Since the number of patients and their children within three of the four diagnostic groups is quite small, our results must be viewed with caution. However, these results suggests that when controlling for number of prior births (a measure of increased exposure of risk of PBCs), and including both chronic and acute patients within each diagnostic category, the results are contrary to what might be expected.
CONCLUSION
Consistent with other recent research comparing mentally ill and well motherchild pairs, the results of the present research suggest that maternal psychiatric disturbance, as such, has little impact on the development of pregnancy and birth complications. The children of mentally ill women do not appear to be at greater risk than the children of well women for such perinatal complications simply as a result of their mothers' psychiatric illness. In the present study, we have not considered pregnancy and birth complications among women already ill at the time of their most recent pregnancy, as contrasted with women well at the time of pregnancy and delivery who developed their psychiatric illness first during the period after childbirth. However, our results suggest that problems encountered during pregnancy and childbirth may aggravate the mother's disturbance;

the number of reported PBCs was greater among women with acute rather than chronic disturbance.
Perhaps a more profitable direction for future research would be the identification of factors such as the nature and extent of maternal life-event stress or anxiety which are likely to affect the course of pregnancy and childbirth (see Garmezy, 19746). It would be much more useful to isolate the psychological factors involved in the development of PBCs than to use rather imprecise diagnostic categories, the psychological meanings of which are still unclear. It is also possible that the particular pregnancy and childbirth complications tabulated in this and other studies have little relevance for the larger goal of isolating the factors which are associated with the quality of the child's subsequent adjustment, but that other factors, not currently measured, might be more appropriate predictors. Information regarding this latter possibility is not yet available, although longitudinal research such as that reported by Sameroff and Zax (1973a) may eventually be able to provide such information. I t is particularly important that we be able to identify those children who subsequently show psychopathology and to determine which events from prenatal life to adulthood are associated with the development of such psychopathology.
