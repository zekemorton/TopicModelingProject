ABSTRACT:The count of American Indians in the 1980 census was over 70 per cent larger than the 1970 census count. An assessment of the demographic basis for this change shows that the cohorts from ages 10 to 74 in 1980 increased by substantial amounts, reaching 35 per cent for many ages. Increases of this nature in the absence of immigration are demographically impossible--an indication that the changes in response patterns identified by Passel (1976) between the 1970 and 1960 censuses persisted in 1980, possibly at even greater levels.
In addition to presenting demographic analyses of the American Indian data at the national level, this paper includes an analysis of geographic variation of implied birth, death, and migration rates at the state level. States which historically have had large American Indian populations in general had high birth and death rates with reasonable migration rates. Many other states, however, had anomalously low birth and death rates with extraordinarily high implied migration rates. This pattern suggests that the changes in response may have occurred primarily in the latter areas.
Several other anomalies in the American Indian data are reported here. The sample figure for American Indians from the 1980 census exceeds the complete count by more than 8 per cent at the national level. Increases occurred in most states, but the amount of increase varied substantially. Also, the increases tend to occur outside American Indian areas (reservations, tribal trust lands, etc.). Such differences are, for the most part, outside of expected sample variability. Furthermore, differences in the number of persons reporting American Indian race and American Indian ancestry were substantial. Some of the causes of these differences are investigated here. The paper concludes with an overall assessment of the quality and utility of these census data for various types of analysis.

The count of American Indians, Eskimos, Aleuts1 in the 1980 census was 1,420,400. This figure represents an increase more than 70 per cent over the corresponding 1970 census count of * 827,268. Since there is almost no immigration of American Indians into the
1Most of the data in this paper are for the combination of American Indians, Eskimos, and Aleuts. We will use the terms "American Indian" and "Indian" to refer to this combined group. When data are for American Indians only and do not include Eskimos and Aleuts, the fact will be noted in the text and the term used to refer to the group will be marked by an asterisk, i.e., American Indian*.

United States, the increase could only come from natural increase (the excess of births over deaths) if the sole source of the increase were demographic. However, since increases of this magnitude are demographically impossible over a sustained period, there must be a nondemographic explanation for the almost 7 per cent average annual growth of the American Indian population during the 1970's.
Further confirmation of the unusual nature of the change in the numbers of American Indians is found in the patterns of cohort change over 1970-80.

can explain only a very small portion of the error of closure. The births have been corrected already by 2.6 per cent or about 8,000 births.2 Very much higher underregistration of American Indian births in the 1970's is extremely unlikely. Overregistration of deaths is almost never alikely explanation. In any
2Estimates of completeness of birth registration for American Indians for 1950-70 are from Passel (1976). For 1970-80, estimates are derived by assuming that the rate of improvement in registration completeness for 1970-80 was the same as for 1960-70. The per cent of American Indian births registered for 1970 is estimated as 96.2 per cent; for 1980, the estimate is 98.5 per cent. For the 1970-80 decade, the estimated completeness of registration is 97.4 per cent. All of these figures are consistent with the correction factors used for the other races, population in national estimates of census undercount (Passel and Robinson, 1984).

case, the deaths amount to only 63,000 and the error of closure is almost 358,000. The remaining demographic component, international immigration of American Indians, accounts for only a fewpeople; there were 38,190 foreignborn American Indians in the 1980 census. Thus, immigration could not possibly make up the difference between the estimate andthe census figure.
One other possibility is that the 1970 census figure was grossly understated. Two major factors argue against thisexplanation. First, the amount of understatement in 1970 required to explain the error of closure would imply anundercount of almost 30 per cent. This level of undercount for anentire population group has never been encountered in any recent U.S. census (Passel and

Robinson, 1984). Second, the study by Passel (1976) shows that many age groups and, indeed, possibly the entire American Indian population were greatly overstated in the 1970 census.
The one remaining explanation for the large error of closure is the same as that offered byPassel for the 1960-70error of closure--inconsistency in the identification of individuals as American Indians between the latter census (1980), on the one hand, and vital statistics and the earlier census (1970), on the other hand. Individuals must be identifying themselves as American Indian in the 1980census whowere not identified as American Indian in the 1970 census or in the vital statistics system. The changing self-identification which occurred in the 1960's has apparently continued (and increased) in the 1970s.3
INTERCENSAL COHORT CHANGES
The error of closure identified in the preceding section can be further broken down to age and sex groups. The calculation shown in Table 2 starts from the 1970 census count of American Indians by age4 and births during the intercensal period, corrected for underregistration. Immigration from abroad and emigra-
3One other possibility for the excess in the American Indian population is that persons from India mayhave misread or misunderstood the race question and responded erroneously as "American Indian" rather than "Asian Indian." We have found no evidence to suggest that such misreporting was a significant factor contributing to the large American Indian count. Specifically, the counts for Asian Indians correspond very well to data on immigration from India.
·"Detailed age-sex data for the American Indian population in 1970were derived by adjusting single year of age figures from the sample data to complete count figures for 5-year age groups by sex. Data byage andsex corresponding toTables 2 and 3 are available on request from the senior author.

tion are both assumed to be negligible for all ages in this calculation. Then, deaths by cohort5 are subtracted from the initial populations to yield an estimated population for 1980 byage.
Differences between the age-specific estimates for 1980 and the censusfigures for American Indians represent errors of closure. Positive errors of closure in Table 2 indicate that the census exceeds the estimate; negative errors, that the census falls short of the estimate. The error of closure for a cohort represents the sum of several components--errors in the estimated components of change and differences in coverage between the censuses. A full understanding of the overall error of closure for the American Indian population requires an assessment of these individual components.
The most striking feature of Table 2 is that all of the cohorts between ages 10 and 74 in 1980 increasedin size between the 1970 census and the 1980 census. Errors of closure for these cohorts are all large and generally exceed 30 per cent. The only plausible explanation for this pattern is, again, that persons are being recruited to the American Indian population by changing their selfidentification over time.
At ages 75and over, the errors of closure are smaller and even slightly negative. The amount of shifting selfidentification into the American Indian category thus appears to be considerably less at older ages. In fact, for thetotal of all ages over 70, the error of closure is very nearly zero. This pattern
^American Indian deaths by age and sex were tabulated from public use tapes from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) for 197O-76. Totals for other years were distributed by age using thedistribution from 1974-76.

may be the result of slight misallocation of deaths to the different cohorts at the older ages since the errors of closure vary considerably by age.
The errors of closure at the very youngest ages suggest that the changing self-identification of American Indians is beginning to be reflected in the vital statistics. The errors of closure under age 10 are developed from birth statistics, not from the previous census. The negative errors of closure for the cohort under 5 years of age in 1980 indicate some undercount in the 1980 census at these ages. Thus, relative to births over 1975-80, the 1980 census is understated and not overstated, as it is for other cohorts. For ages 5-9 in 1980, the 8 per cent error of closure is not nearly as large as at higher ages. For this cohort the shifting self-identification appears to be at an intermediate level, perhaps because the individuals counted in the census did not fill out the census form themselves.
ESTIMATED CENSUS "UNDERCOUNT"
(AGES UNDER 30)
Passel (1976) constructed independent demographic estimates of the American Indian population under age 20 in 1970 from corrected births for 1950-70 and registered deaths for the same period. He found very large undercounts for American Indians under age 10 in the 1960 census and under age 5 in the 1970 census. The undercounts for ages 5-14 in 1970 were moderate, but for ages 15-19 small overcounts appeared to be the beginning of age-specific shifts in self-identification to American Indian.
The 1970 estimates of the American Indian population under age 20 provide the starting point for estimates of the same population under age 30 in 1980

presented here. The estimates shown in Table 3 are based on corrected American Indian births for 1970-80 and Passel's (1976) estimates for 1970. Registered deaths by age are subtracted from the initial 1970 estimates to yield the estimates for 1980. The difference between the estimated American Indian population for 1980 and the census count provides an estimate of the "undercount" in the 1980 census.
At the youngest ages, under 3 years, identification of individuals as American Indian on birth certificates appears to be consistent with the selfidentification in the 1980 census. The coverage estimates show significant undercounts in the census at these ages that are approximately the same magnitude as the estimates for blacks at the same ages (Passel and Robinson, 1984). This result, coupled with the substantial increase in American Indian births over the several years before the census (Table 1), suggests that the parents who are reporting their children as American Indian in the census may also be reporting themselves as American Indian on birth certificates so that the children's births are registered as American Indian.6-7
6Registered births areassigned to racial groups on the basis of the reported races of the parents and noton the basis of a direct question of the race of the child. Thus, for a birth to be classified as American Indian, oneor both parents must report a race of American Indian.
7The results in Table 3 show a minor anomaly at ages 0-2 which also appears in other racial groups. The undercount at age 0 is substantially less than at age 1. Examination of the census data shows that this pattern is the result of apparent overreporting in the census at age 0, rather than undercounting at age 1.Thecensus count for age 0 is 9.8 per cent greater than the count for age 1, whereas the corresponding births are only 4.5per cent greater. Similar patterns of overreporting at age 0 appear in the 1980census for whites, blacks, and Hispanics, but we have found no satisfactory explanation.

At ages above 3, the patterns of reporting by American Indians are different. Through age 8, the slight "overcounts" give some indication that more people are reporting their children as American Indian in the census than are reporting as American Indian on birth certificates. At age 9, there is substantial overreporting, too. About half of this excess in the census is the result of "age heaping," rather than changing selfidentification, i.e., a substantial number of people reported 1970 as a birth year who were not born in 1970. Age 9 has 8.7 per cent more people than age 8, but the corresponding births for age 9 were actually 3.8 per cent less than the births for age 8.
For the older ages in Table 3, those from 10-29, the substantial degree of shifting self-identification is very apparent. Table 3 shows a 37.6 per cent overcount for the age group 10-14. The amount of changing self-identification which occurred since birth in this cohort is huge (over 50 per cent), since the cohort had an estimated undercount of 15 per cent in 1970! The next three 5-year age groups also show shifts of about the same magnitude between 1970 and 1980. The "overcounts" for 1980 for the age groups, with 1970 "undercounts" in parentheses, are: age 15-19,49 per cent overcount (8 per cent undercount in 1970); age 20-24,44 per cent overcount (4 per cent undercount); and age 25-29, 53 per cent overcount (2 per cent overcount).
GEOGRAPHIC DIMENSIONS OF QUALITY OF 1980 CENSUS DATA
FOR AMERICAN INDIANS
The preceding discussion has identified demographic components of overstatement of American Indians in the

1980 census, but has not addressed the question of what parts of the country experienced this overstatement. Analysis of birth and death rates for states in 1979-81 and 1969-71 can be used to identify specific areas where the overstatement appears to be concentrated. Analysis of intercensal change for states in 1970-80 and 1960-70 provides additional confirmation for the findings of the birth and death rate analysis.
BIRTH AND DEATH RATES
American Indians have higher than average birth rates. As Table 1 shows, the birth rate for American Indians consistently exceeded 30 births per 1,000 population during the 1970's while the overall birth rate in the United States is about 15per 1,000. The crude death rate for American Indians, about 7 per 1,000, is somewhat lower than the overall death rate of about 9. The low death rate, in spite of higher than average agespecific mortality rates, is the result of a young age distribution among American Indians.
Below the national level, birth and death rates would be expected to vary around these average rates, //the demographic situation were normal. However, because the situation is not normal, there is considerable variation in state-level birth and death rates. As discussed in the previous section, the 1980 census count of American Indians showed a high degree of "overcounting" relative to the 1970 census count. Areas with substantial "excesses" of American Indians would be expected to show abnormally low birth and death rates because the denominator of the rate (i.e., the American Indian population in the census) is artificially inflated. Areas without substantial overreporting would be expected to have birth and death

with only 1rate below 4 (Michigan).

The geographic pattern of birth and death rates is well defined. To identify it, we will delineate a group of states as "Indian states." These are states that had 3,000 or more American Indians in the 1950 census, excluding California which has behaved demographically over the last three decades much like a typical "non-Indian" state. This definition identified 19states which had 87per cent of the American Indian population in the 48 states in 1950. The 19 states are: New York, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Montana, Idaho, Wyoming, New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, and Alaska.9
8The differences in national rates are the result of differently denned denominators. In the lower national rates (Table 4), 1980 census counts are the denominators. In the higher ones (Table 1), estimates based on the 1970 census provide the denominators.
9 T w oother states might have been designated as "Indian" states using somewhat different definitions. The two additional states are Mississippi and Colorado. Inclusion or exclusion of these states does not substantially affect the results of the analyses.

The remaining 32 non-Indian states have a collective American Indian birth rate of only 17. The death rate is a ridiculously low 2! Five states have birth rates below 10 for American Indians and 16states (including California) have death rates below 2. Rates this low certainly do not reflect the actual behavior of the American Indian population. In particular, the birth rate could not be so low in a population which is growing as fast as the American Indian population apparently is; death rates this low are virtually impossible.
The geographic pattern of birth and death rates implies that the American Indian population is reasonably well defined in the "Indian states" (and possibly also in Colorado and Mississippi). In these 19 states, the definition of American Indians used in the vital statistics system appears to be consistent with the self-identification of individuals as American Indian in the 1980 census. In non-Indian states, however, the American Indian population in the census appears to be drawn from the general population. The American Indian birth rate in the non-Indian states is ap-

treated during processing phases. A review of data for selected states-- Arkansas, Vermont, Oklahoma-- showed that a portion of the increase between the 100-per-cent figure and the sample estimate was from persons who were American Indian in the sample, but another race in the 100-per-cent data (see Table 10). Most of these persons did not fill in the pre-coded circle for American Indian provided on the census form as a response to the race question, but rather wrote in an entry, such as a tribal designation, to indicate that they were Indian. Some of these cases in the 100-per-cent data were left as "other races" or allocated on race; but, in the sample data they were coded as American Indian. For example, in a substantial number of the cases reviewed in Oklahoma (45 per cent), the respondents did not fill the American Indian circle but wrote in "Cherokee."

This pattern suggests that there may have been some confusion on the part of respondents as to the intent of the race question. The confusion could be the result, in part, from the omission of the word "race" from the question.
We can infer from the response patterns that for many individuals classified as American Indian* in the census the strength of identification as American Indian is not great. In particular, the multiple responses to the race item in conjunction with write-in responses suggest that individuals were not providing the primary racial group with which they identified, but rather all groups with which they felt some degree of identification. On the other hand, other persons may have identified with a particular tribe, but not with the broader group of "American Indian" and, thus, not have been properly classified in the 100per-cent data.

operations show that the "extra" American Indians (i.e., the additional persons in the sample as well as the excess over numbers expected on the basis of previous censuses) were not created by other census processing, computer errors, or census allocation procedures. Nevertheless, the patterns of response suggest that the design of the race item may have contributed to overreporting in the American Indian category.
AMERICAN INDIAN ANCESTRY DATA
The 1980 census and the November 1979 Current Population Survey (CPS) also provide data on the population of American Indian descent from a question that asked individuals to provide information on their "ancestry or descent." This ancestry question was asked in addition to the race question which provided the data analyzed to this point. Many more people claimed some American Indian ancestry in response to the ancestry question than the number who claimed to be American Indian in response to the race question. In the November 1979 CPS, about 10 million people claimed some degree of American Indian ancestry; in the 1980 census, about 7 million persons did so.
The extremely large populations reporting American Indian ancestry when compared with the race figures for American Indians* suggest that the degree of identification as Indian on the part of most of these people is not very strong. The lack of strength of identificationas American Indian is shown by the tendency of persons to report an additional ancestry in addition to the American Indian response--71 per cent did so. This was particularly true among persons of American Indian ancestry

who did not report American Indian* race. About 83 per cent of the population of American Indian ancestry of white race also reported another ancestry, usually a European ancestry. On the m other hand, of persons who reported both American Indian* race and ancestry, only 22 percent reported another ancestry; 78 per cent reported only the American Indian ancestry.
Another perspective on the same phenomenon is given by the race distribution of persons who reported American Indian ancestry. Most of the persons who reported American Indian in the 1980 census in response to the ancestry item, responded as white in the race item; about 77 per cent of the population of American Indian ancestry was white and only 18 per cent reported American Indian race. Of the persons who reported a multiple ancestry which included an American Indian ancestry, only 5 per cent gave American Indian* as their race, but 90 per cent reported as white in the race item. The racial composition of persons reporting a single ancestry of American Indian was very different--48 per cent American Indian race and only 46 per cent white.
The tendency toward consistency in reporting of American Indian* race and ancestry, or the lack there of, varied depending on where people lived. Persons inside American Indian areas were considerably more likely to report a single ancestry of American Indian than per- * sons who lived outside American Indian areas. The strength of identification as American Indian was especially pronounced among persons inside American Indian areas who reported American Indian* race; 94 per cent of these persons reported a single American Indian ancestry, whereas only 70 per cent of such persons outside American In-

why this happened are not at all clear, but some possibilities include the form of the race question, real economic incentives for being American Indian in some states, reduced discrimination against American Indians, increased willingness to self-identify as American Indian, and increased use of selfenumeration in the census, as well asa myriad of other possibilities.
IMPLICATIONS FOR DATA USERS
The analyses of American Indian data from the 1980 census presented here suggest that users exercise considerable caution in using and interpreting data on the American Indian population. Users must be aware ofthe method of data collection and of the possible deficiencies inthe data. Data forAmerican Indians areprobably of good quality in the areas we have delineated as "Indian states" and in identified American Indian areas. Self-identification asAmerican Indian in areas which historically have had substantial American Indian populations seems to provide a reasonable basis for defining thepopulation.
On the other hand, in areas which we have designated as "non-Indian," the 1980 census figures probably greatly overstate the American Indian popula-

tion as defined with more objective measures. For these areas especially, users must exercise caution in interpreting and using 1980 census data onAmerican Indians. One indicator which users may findhelpful isthe American Indian population whoprovided a tribal designation in the 1980 census. In general, the population with a tribal designation (possibly excluding those who responded "Cherokee") appears to represent persons who would have responded as American Indian inprevious censuses and vital statistics.
The Census Bureau is pursuing aprogram of research and evaluation that may avoid similar problems with American Indian data and race data in general for the 1990 census. A number of alternative formulations of the race item are being tested. Thetests include smallfocus groups, a National Content Test and accompanying reinterview studies in 1986, the 1986 test census, and a national test planned for1987.
