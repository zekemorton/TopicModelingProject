ABSTRACT: This paper reviews recent literature on the determinants of the sex ratio at birth. The first part provides an overview of the major findings on the biological determinants, and their implications on the racial differentials and the wartime increases in the sex ratio at birth. The second part discusses the sociodemographic factors of the sex ratio at birth (age of parents, birth order, and socioeconomic status). About thirty studies based on samples of millions of births drawn from national vital registration statistics in various countries are reviewed and compared. The results indicate that birth order and paternal age appear to be negatively correlated with the sex ratio at birth. Parents of higher socioeconomic status may be more likely to bear sons than parents of lower socioeconomic status. Some possible causal mechanisms are suggested for the effects of the sociodemographic factors.

It is common knowledge that more males than females are born and that the sex ratio at birth usually varies between 104 and 107 boys per 100 girls. Since Graunt first observed a disparity between the number of male and female births in 1662, many researchers have investigated the levels, patterns of variation, and determinants of the sex ratio of live births. Some theories about sex determination are rather unspecific and have not been properly tested. For example, in 1741, Sussmilch invoked the wisdom of the Creator in ensuring that "4 to 5 per cent more boys than girls are born, thus compensating for the higher male losses due to the recklessness of boys, to exhaustion and to dangerous tasks, to war, to sailing, to emigration, and Who thus maintains the balance between the two sexes so that everyone can find a spouse at the appropriate time

for marriage." (see Sussmilch, 1979. t. II, p. 505)
Many other theories, however, have been the object of scientific research. The discoveries brought about by research in this field may have farreaching implications. If some factors were identified as having a likely effect and this effect was of a significant order of magnitude, then it could imply that preference for one sex over the other could lead to behavior modification in order to determine the sex of children. In a low fertility population, any success in such a strategy could create an imbalance between the sexes. In turn, such an imbalance could constitute a threat to social norms and values. It could also alter population growth through its effects on availability of mates, age at marriage, and age at childbearing. The longterm implications of research on the de-

groups: those affecting the primary sex

In the last fifteen years, research on the determinants of the sex ratio at birth has concentrated on two main orientations. The first orientation consists of research on the relatively immediate biological determinants. The second orientation consists of the study of the so-

ratio (PSR) and those affecting the survival of the embryo in utero. Determinants of the primary sex ratio consist of the physiological characteristics of the sperm and of the mother's reproductive tract. Determinants of the survival of the embryo in utero include the em-

bryo's viability, and the immunological interactions between mother and embryo.
FACTORS AFFECTING THE PRIMARY
SEX RATIO
Before reviewing the main findings on the determinants of the PSR, it might be useful to summarize current knowledge on the levels of the PSR. Theoretically, production of male sperm involves an equal number of X-bearing and Ybearing spermatozoa. Theoretically then, if no other factor intervened, equal numbers of male and female zygotes should be produced. Empirical estimation of the PSR has to rely on determination of the sex of human embryos lost early in the pregnancy. Some problems in the estimation of the PSR are that samples of early abortions are often very small, and that the gestational age itself has to be estimated. An additional difficulty is that the methods and techniques used to determine the sex of an embryo may be sources of bias. Some estimates of the PSR (generally the older ones) range from 110 to 170. Other estimates (based on more recent techniques and on earlier abortions) are closer to 100 and even as low as 90.1
Some researchers have investigated the possibility that variation in the PSR is the main source of variation in the SRB (also called secondary sex ratio). Studies of the physiology of the sperm have shown that Y-bearing and X-
1See, for example, Winston, 1932; Lawrence, 1941; Stevenson and Bobrow, 1967; Sasaki et al., 1971; Sasaki, 1973; Kostrova, 1972-1973; Coppo et al., 1973; Goldstein and Ketchum, 1974; Boue, 1976; Creasy, 1977; Yamamoto et al., 1977; Matthiessen and Matthiessen, 1977; McMillen, 1979; Degenhardt et al., 1980; Hassold et al., 1983; Kellokumpu-Lehtienen and Pelliniemi, 1984.

bearing spermatozoa may have slightly different characteristics, one type being favored at fertilization. Such characteristics could be differential motility, or different mean durations of survival (Seguy, 1915a,b; Rinehart, 1975; Roberts, 1978). These factors alone do not seem to account for the observed variation in the SRB.
By contrast, age of the ovum at fertilization and chemical balance of the female genital tract are thought to be likely determinants of the SRB through their effects on the sex ratio at conception. In fact, the levels of maternal hormone circulating at the time of conception may explain the racial variation found in the SRB. While the figure of 106 males for 100 females is generally accepted as the usual SRB for white populations, that for black populations seems to be consistently lower and ranges from 102 to 104 (Visaria, 1967; Tarver and Lee, 1968; Teitelbaum, 1970, 1972; Erickson, 1976; Ruder, 1986). James (1980a, b, c, d, 1983, 1984a, b, 1985, 1986) hypothesizes that higher gonadotrophin levels imply a lower SRB, while lower levels imply a higher SRB. Gonadotrophin levels are also thought to affect the dizygotic twinning rate, higher hormonal levels corresponding to higher twinning rates. Hence, evidence cited by James in support of his hypothesis consists of the negative correlation found between the sex ratios at birth and the dizygotic twinning rates of the different races and by the synchronicity between the seasonal variation in the SRB and the dizygotic twinning rate.
James also suggests that the chance of a male conception is higher early and late in the menstrual cycle because of rapid variation in maternal hormone

levels. Hence, the SRB of children conceived early and late in the menstrual cycle would be higher. This hypothesis may put an end to the long search for an explanation of the rising sex ratio at birth during war time. The rise in the SRB of belligerent countries during and after wars has been described in a number of studies (Russell, 1936; MacMahon and Pugh, 1954; Bernstein, 1958; Houdaille, 1973). For example, marked increases (of 1 to 2 per cent) were observed in France and in England and Wales at the time of World War I and World War II. A similar rise, of smaller magnitude, was observed in the U.S. white population during World War II.
Various types of explanation had been offered previously. The existence of "natural regulatory mechanisms" was invoked: Nature compensates for the loss of males. A more demographic explanation consists of the observation of a compositional effect, i.e., relatively high proportions of the births then occurred to young mothers at low parities. Under the assumption that such women are more prone to bear male children, this would explain a higher SRB (Martin, 1943). The compositional explanation was judged unsatisfactory by MacMahon and Pugh (1953, 1954) and a more biological explanation was suggested by Bernstein (1958). She hypothesized that women with high fecundability had a higher probability of male births, and that a relatively high number of such women were giving birth during and just after wars. Pursuing Bernstein's hypothesis, James (1983) now contends that a behavioral factor, high coital frequency, is the cause of these high sex ratios at birth. Women exposed to high coital rates conceive, on the average, earlier in their menstrual cycle than

other women, and thus have a higher chance of having boys.2
FACTORS AFFECTING PRENATAL
MORTALITY
There is considerable mortality in the interval between conception and birth, but data on prenatal mortality are scarce. Reporting of fetal losses is far from complete simply because registration of such losses is generally not required. In addition, early losses are often unobserved. Despite the difficulties involved, a plausible pattern by sex of prenatal mortality has been identified. It appears that higher male mortality, for which there is evidence during most of the prenatal period, may not characterize the very early stages after conception (Keller, 1969, cited in Stern, 1973; Boue, 1976; McMillen, 1969; Schtickzelle, 1981a). The sex ratio of fetal deaths is reported highest between gestational months 3 and 5, lower between months 6 and 7 or 8, and increases at term.
Differential survival rates of male and female embryos during gestation
2Other works have brought both supporting and contradictory evidence to James' hypothesis. The sex ratio of unplanned births seems to be consistently high (Lampe, 1954, 1955; Shiono et al., 1982;Perez et al., 1985). This effect is generally attributed to conceptions occurring early or late in the menstrual cycle, a finding consistent with James' hypothesis. By contrast, a statistical analysis of the effect of interracial mating on the SRB concludes that racial differences in the SRB are due to the effect of the father's but not the mother's race (Khoury et al., 1984). Correlation analyses of the SRB and the dizygotic twinning rate in various European and non-European countries did not reveal any strong evidence of a negative correlation (Chahnazarian, 1986). No strong evidence of seasonal patterns in the SRB is found except in the U.S. (Strandskov, 1942; Slatis, 1953; Pollard, 1969; Vallin and Lebras, 1970; Lyster, 1968, 1971; Hoffman, 1979, 1980; Czeizel, 1980; James, 1980a, b.).

may theoretically produce a SRB quite different from the PSR. Moreover, any factor affecting prenatal mortality rates and patterns can be expected to affect the sex ratio of surviving fetuses eventually to be born alive. For example, in several European countries, with the decrease over time in the stillbirth rates, the sex ratio of stillbirths dropped from values as high as 130in Sweden and Belgium at the beginning of the century to levels closer to 110 in the 1970's (Teitelbaum, 1971;Schtickzelle, 1981c; Ulizzi, 1983), with a positive effect on the SRB.
Some causes of fetal death may be sex selective, and variation in such causes may alter the SRB. Early in the pregnancy, the embryo's viability may be impaired by genetic and anatomical anomalies. It is thought that well over half of the spontaneous abortions are due to chromosomic aberrations, which often affect the sexual chromosomes. Research on the genetic variability in the SRB has generated an extensive literature, but no clear pattern emerges from the statistical analyses. Multiple studies of various populations only produced conflicting evidence of a positive correlation between the sexes of siblings (Malinvaud, 1955; Renkonen et al., 1962; Edwards, 1962, 1966; Trichopoulos, 1967; Bernstein, 1975; Berquo, 1977; Gray et al., 1980; Pickles et al., 1982; Curtsinger et al., 1983; Gualtieri etal.,1984).
The mechanisms of immunological interaction between the mother and the embryo also seems to be a possible source of sex selective spontaneous abortions occurring very early in the pregnancy. For example, immunological reactions have been thought to occur within ABO blood groups and influence the sex ratio at implantation (Hunt, 1965; Hytten and Leitch, 1971; Allan,

1975; Gloria-Bottini, 1979). It seems that it is also through the mechanisms of immunological interactions between the mother and the embryo that infection with the hepatitis B virus may have an influence on the SRB (Drew et al., 1978fl, b, 1982, 1986; London et al., 1982; Blumberg, 1979; London, 1979; Cazal et al., 1976; Hesser et al., 1975, 1976; Hesser, 1974; Mazzur and Watson, 1974; Robertson and Sheard, 1973).
SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC DETERMINANTS OF
THE SEX RATIO ATBIRTH
Maternal age, paternal age, and birth order are the three demographic factors that have often been thought to affect the SRB. Interest in these factors dates from the 1920's, perhaps because of the availability of such data from birth certificates.The mechanisms through which such factors may produce their effects have rarely been discussed, but it is clear that they operate either through their alteration of the PSR, or through their modification of the prenatal mortality and stillbirth rates, or both. The possible effects of maternal age, paternal age, and birth order on PSR do not seem to be documented. In view of the preceding discussion, however, it may be argued that the characteristics of the sperm and the levels of maternal hormone may vary with age, or that coital frequency may vary with parental age or birth order. Therefore, parental age and birth order could indirectly affect the PSR, and, as a result, the SRB.
Some effects of parental age and birth order on prenatal mortality and stillbirth rates have been documented. For example, age of the mother and parity appear to be positively correlated with prenatal and perinatal mortality (Shapiro et al., 1971; Leridon, 1973;

Socioeconomic conditions are often invoked as an explanation for the variation over time and across regions in perinatal mortality rates (Cann and CavalliSforza, 1968; Adelstein et al., 1980; Edouard and Alberman, 1982).

birth order, socioeconomic status, race, and a few other factors. The data on which the great majority of these studies are based are vital registration data. The sample sizes generally reach several million births. Data from various countries are used; all these countries have high quality birth registration systems. Not all studies analyze the effects of all three demographic factors (maternal age, paternal age, and birth order), and only a minority include the study of socioeconomic factors. The racial factor can only be included when applicable. Table 1 summarizes the findings of 14 studies of the sociodemographic determinants of the sex ratio of live births. These works adopt a univariate approach in their analyses. Table 2 presents the findings of 19multivariate studies of the sociodemographic determinants of the SRB.
Out of the 13 univariate studies (including 15 data sets) of the effect of maternal age on the SRB, only 3 conclude that there is an absence of any consistent effect (Table 1). The majority of the works find a negative effect of maternal age on the SRB, and none finds a positive effect; the SRB appears to be higher for younger mothers, lower for older mothers. The effect of paternal age is described in 9 univariate studies, 7 of which conclude that there is a negative effect. Younger fathers seem to have more male births than older fathers. In 11 out of the 12 univariate studies of the effect of birth order, it was found that birth order affects the SRB negatively. Births of lower orders have a higher proportion male than births of higher orders. Two U.S. studies confirm that the SRB is higher for whites than for blacks. The effect of urbanization, which is analyzed in 3 studies, is doubtful. Legitimacy does not seem to affect the SRB.

In Italy, region of birth does not seem to influence the SRB, and age of the maternal grandfather does not appear to have a prominent role in determining the proportion male at birth. One study using data from England and Wales findsthat the SRB increases with higher socioeconomic status.
In order to disentangle the effects of the demographic and socioeconomic factors on the SRB, a multivariate approach seems necessary. Thefindingsof the multivariate studies of the effects of maternal age, paternal age, birth order, socioeconomic status, and race qualify the results obtained in univariate studies (Table 2). The most interesting insight that is gained by using multivariate methods is probably related to the role of maternal age in determining the SRB. Once the effects of paternal age and/or birth order are controlled for, the effect of maternal age weakens, takes a bell shape, or even disappears. Paternal age and/or birth order could account for the apparent gradient observed in the SRB with maternal age.
The effect of paternal age is ambiguous. In six studies, the negative effect of paternal age persists after the effects of maternal age and/or birth order are controlled for. In another six studies, the paternal age effect weakens, takes a bell shape, or appears only in the form of an interaction effect with maternal age or birth order. Nevertheless, the effect of paternal age on the SRB appears to be stronger than that of maternal age, once a multivariate approach is used in the analysis.
In 12 studies, the negative effect of birth order on the SRB persists after the effects of maternal age or paternal age or both are controlled for. It persists independent of the effect of race. This ef-

feet remains small, however. Teitelbaum et al. (1971) estimate that the effect of birth order is reflected in a reduction of only 0.26 of the relative odds of male birth among fifth and later births as compared with those of first births. Imaizumi and Murata (1981) reject the hypothesis that a change in the distribution of births by parity may have caused the secular increase in the SRB of Japan.
Four studies include one or more measures of socioeconomic status in their multivariate models (see Table 2). It is interesting to note that when socioeconomic status seems to affect the SRB, the effect of birth order tends to disappear. The effects of socioeconomic status itself are debatable. The two U.S. studies that include socioeconomic status as a factor also control for the effect of race. Race can thus probably be ruled out as a confounding factor for any effect of socioeconomic status on the SRB. It seems that the differences in the results may be linked to the differing validity of the indicators used in the various studies. For example, Teitelbaum and Mantel (1971) used three different indicators of socioeconomic status in their study and obtained different results. Teitelbaum and Mantel further qualify their findings by pointing out that the relationship between socioeconomic status and the SRB could be operative only over the lower portion of the socioeconomic scale. Finally, the racial variation in the SRB persists independent of any effect of maternal age, paternal age, birth order, or socioeconomic status.
As already noted, mother's age and parity seem to be positively related with stillbirth rates. By extension, the patterns of stillbirth rates by maternal age

and birth order have often been thought to explain the negative relationship between these factors and the sex ratio of live births. The idea is as follows: If there is a positive correlation between maternal age (or paternal age), or birth order and the stillbirth rate, then the higher proportion male of stillbirths could explain the lower proportion male of surviving fetuses eventually to be born alive to older parents or at higher birth orders. For this mechanism to constitute a satisfactory explanation of the effects of maternal age, paternal age, and birth order on the sex ratio of live births, no similar effects should be detected on the sex ratio of total births (live births + stillbirths).
A few studies analyze the effects of maternal age, paternal age, and birth order on the sex ratios of stillbirths and total births. Their findings are summarized in Table 3. These studies are based on vital registration data. Because stillbirths are often unreported and their number is subject to a large random component, the results can only be indicative.
The top panel of Table 3 presents the findings of three studies of the relationships between maternal age or birth order and the sex ratio of stillbirths. It seems that the two factors are positively related to the proportion male of stillbirths.
The middle panel of Table 3 presents the results of four univariate studies of the effects of maternal age and birth order on the sex ratio of total births (SRTB). The comparison between Tables 1 and 3 shows no marked change in thefindings:The SRTB is negatively affected by maternal age and birth order when each factor is examined without controlling for the other.

The third panel of Table 3 presents the results of four multivariate studies of jthe effects of maternal age, paternal age, and birth order on the SRTB. In this case, unavailability of the data make it impossible to compare the effects on the SRTB with the effects of the same factors on the sex ratio of the live birth components. The results for maternal age are difficult to interpret. However, we have seen earlier that maternal age has probably little or no effect on the SRB. The effects of paternal age and birth order on the SRTB seem to be negative, as is the case for their effects on the sex ratio of live births.
In summary, this review of about 30 studies of the sociodemographic determinants of the SRB allows the following conclusions: (a) Maternal age has probably little or no effect on the SRB, its apparent effect in univariate studies probably being due to the strong correlation between maternal age, paternal age, and birth order, (b) Paternal age could have a negative effect. Younger fathers seem to have a higher chance of having boys than older fathers, (c) Birth order seems to have a negative effect. The sex ratio of lower order births is higher than that of higher order births, (d) It is not clear whether socioeconomic status is really related to the SRB. If it is, it could account for the paternal age and birth order effects, (e) The racial variation in the SRB persists independent of any other effect, (f) It should be noted that all the effects remain very small, (g) It does not appear that the patterns by maternal age, paternal age, and birth order of late fetal mortality can fully explain the effects of such factors on the sex ratio of live births. The mechanisms of such effects probably also operate at earlier gestational stages.

SUMMARY
The sex ratio of live births in human populations is characterized by a remarkable homogeneity across populations and over time. More males than females are born, and the SRB usually varies between 104 and 107. Nevertheless, some systematic patterns of variation are detected in European and nonEuropean countries with high quality birth registration. Race is the most striking factor influencing the SRB. Black populations have consistently lower sex ratios at birth than white populations. A rise in the SRB of belligerent countries and after wars has been observed.
Numerous investigators have studied the patterns of variation and determinants of the SRB. In the last 15years, research in this field has focused on two aspects: the biological determinants of the SRB and the sociodemographic factors. Biological factors likely to influence the SRB must operate either on the sex ratio at conception or on the chance of survival of the embryo. Physiological characteristics of the sperm and of the mother's reproductive tract have been thought to determine the PSR. In fact, one hypothesis suggests that the sex ratio at birth is a direct reflection of the sex ratio at conception and is determined by the levels of maternal hormones circulating at that time. This hypothesis would explain the differences between the races. Blacks, having higher levelsof gonadotrophin, would have a higher probability of conceiving girls, and hence, a lower sex ratio at birth than whites. Variation in the hormonal levels during the menstrual cycle, associated with variation in coital frequency, would also explain the increased sex ratios at birth in belligerent countries during war

time. Some mechanisms of immunological interaction between the mother and the embryo may help explain differential rates of survival in utero for males and females and thus alter the SRB.
Research on the sociodemographic factors of the SRB has produced a number of statistical studies of the relationships between the SRB and factors such as age of the mother, age of the father, birth order, and socioeconomic status. Such studies are generally based on very large samples of birth drawn from national vital statistics in countries with high quality birth registration. The results of about 30 studies are summarized and compared in this review.
The main findings are that birth order and paternal age appear to be negatively correlated with the SRB. Births to younger fathers and births of lower orders seem to have a higher chance of being male. By contrast, maternal age does not seem to be related to the SRB, once the effects of confounding factors such as paternal age and birth order are controlled for. Parents of higher socioeconomic status may be more likely to bear sons than parents of lower socioeconomic status. However, if such effects are real, they remain small and can only be detected in large samples. The effects

of parental age and birth order on late fetal mortality do not appear to fully explain their effects on the sex ratio of live births. The effects of other socioeconomic characteristics (such as legitimacy and urban or rural residence) have also been studied, but no effect was identified.
The causal mechanism through which socioeconomic status may alter the SRB is essentially a compositional one. Since there is male excess mortality during most of the gestation period, any variation in socioeconomic status which could alter the probability of maternal diseases or accidents leading to prenatal mortality could have an effect on the SRB. The causal mechanisms of the effects of birth order and paternal age remain unexplained, but could be related to changes in the physiological characteristics of the reproductive system, or to variation in coital frequency, or to variation in prenatal mortality rates.
