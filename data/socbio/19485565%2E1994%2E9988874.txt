ABSTRACT: Breastfeeding beyond the resumption of mother's menstruation plays a significant role in the proximate determinants of fertility. Breastfeeding and postpartum amenorrhoea data collected from retrospective surveys usually exhibit digit preferences. Here, these heaping errors were smoothed by B-spline and used in multivariate models of risk of conception to investigate the contraceptive effect of breastfeeding. The data used come from a 1987 Indian survey. Results show that lactation, after mother's menses resume, reduces the risk of conception. Heaping in breastfeeding data attenuates this relationship. When adjustment is made, breastfeeding reduced the rate of conception by 47 per cent; the reduction, with adjusted data, was 63 per cent.

Duration of the nonsusceptible period for conception due to postpartum amenorrhoea (PPA) is a major determinant of birth intervals in populations where contraceptive use is minimal. This nonsusceptible period depends to a large extent on breastfeeding practices, in that lactation postpones the return of ovulation after birth during which time a woman cannot conceive.
Both empirical estimates (Habicht et al., 1985; Huffman et al., 1987; John et al., 1987; Jones, 1988; Santow, 1987) and simulation of birth interval dynamics (Bongaarts and Menken, 1983) suggest that, in developing countries, breastfeeding also has a substantial contraceptive effect. Cleland et al. (1984) have also shown that in Asia and Africa lactation reduces total fecundity by 30 to 33 per cent, compared to the reduction by contraception of 20 per cent in Asia and 5 per cent in Africa.
Many researchers have examined the influence of lactation on the length of PPA as well as on the waiting time to

conception once a woman has resumed menses. Epidemiological and laboratory investigations confirm that lactation prolongs PPA and provides some degree of protection against pregnancy even after the resumption of menstruation (McCann et ah, 1981; WHO, 1981).
The relationship between breastfeeding and PPA is well supported by clinical evidence. High levels of anterior pituitary hormone, which suppresses normal ovarian function are strongly related to breastfeeding. When lactation continues for more than a few months, the menses are likely to return while the mother is still breastfeeding. The duration of breastfeeding thus exceeds the length of PPA, and that period can be partitioned into two components: breastfeeding during amenorrhoea and breastfeeding during the menstrual interval. How breastfeeding, after return of menses, might affect the waiting time to conception is usually ignored.

A basic factor that lengthens the waiting time to conception is the period of postpartum anovulation. In most studies, PPA duration is used as a proxy for the duration of postpartum anovulation. Ovulation is, however, the phenomenon of real interest. Ovulation, not menstruation, makes a woman able to conceive.
Breastfeeding may affect a woman's ability to conceive after resuming menses via the production of prolactin. Frequent and intense suckling results in the production of high levels of prolactin, which in turn inhibits ovulation (Lunn et al., 1984). Thus, women who continue to breastfeed following the resumption of menses may have a higher incidence of anovulatory cycles than those women who have weaned their infants.
Continued breastfeeding beyond the resumption of menstruation inhibits the transport of ova down the fallopian tubes and makes the luteal phase inadequate for implantation and sustaining pregnancy (McNeilly, 1988), suggesting an extended time to conception after birth and thus lowering fecundability.
The reported duration of breastfeeding and PPA usually show digit preference at months 3,6,9,12, and so on. Such heaping errors in data are known to attenuate the relationships on ordinary regression models. We examine the effect of such heaping errors in studying the relationship between breastfeeding and PPA in the context of time-dependent hazards models, where a B-spline smoothing technique was used to adjust for the heaping errors in breastfeeding and PPA data. Further, we examine the relationship among PPA, breastfeeding after

menses resume, and waiting time to conception with and without adjustments.
Splines are well known for their usefulness in providing a smooth approximation to a covariate function of unspecified form (Wold, 1974). Smith (1982) employed B-spline in a linear regression problem. O'Sullivan (1988) used smoothing splines to estimate nonlinear covariates in a Cox model. Smoothing splines are effective for examining fine details of regression data in exploratory analysis.
Apart from breastfeeding, socioeconomic and biological factors influence the length or distribution of waiting time to conception in a population (Nath et al., 1993; Singh et al., 1993). Although nutritional intake is also known to influence fecundity, in this study we have no direct information on women's nutritional intake. An alternative is to observe the standard of living of the concerned individual and hence infer about food items. Based on certain characteristics, household socioeconomic status has been defined where it is assumed that individuals belonging to a household have the same status. Other factors, such as religion or caste^ education, place of residence, etc., are known to influence breastfeeding and nutritional behavior (Huffman et al., 1987; Ramchandran, 1987; McCann et al., 1981;Diamond et al., 1985; Srinivasan, et al., 1989; Mukherjee et al., 1991; Nath et al., 1993; Singh et al., 1993). In addition, age also influences fecundity. Therefore, we examine here, through the hazard modeling technique, the effect of breastfeeding after menstruation and PPA on the time of the next conception after controlling the above-

mentioned socioeconomic and biological variables.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The basic data for our research come from a retrospective survey, "Breastfeeding and Its Effect on Fertility," conducted in 1987 under the auspices of the Centre of Population Studies, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India, sponsored by the University Grants Commission, New Delhi. The survey's main objective was to obtain reliable data to study the pattern of breastfeeding and its effect on fertility and to estimate biocultural parameters of human reproduction in traditional societies.
In this connection, several sociocultural, economic, and other factors accounting for variation in duration of lactation and fertility were taken into account. In addition to other information, data were collected relating to age at marriage, total number of children ever born and surviving, including details about duration variables-- lactation, PPA, timing of birth, etc., for births occurring within the last seven years for each married, eligible female in the household. Information on women menstruating, pregnant, amenorrheic, or menopausal was obtained, and those women who had reached menopause were excluded.
The study is based on data from two types of residential areas: 1,100 urban and 900 rural households of Varanasi, a district of Eastern Uttar Pradesh. Varanasi city has been expanding, especially since 1960, by including neighboring villages into the city. The urban households were selected from regions included in the city area before this

time. Rural households were selected from regions included in the urban area during the last thirty years (Singh, 1991).
Several factors affect social status. Social status in India, particularly, in rural areas, is not only a function of caste and landholding but also life-style (Beteille, 1974). Distinctive life-styles are determined through differences in household educational status, housing, etc. The expenditure of rural households is determined not only by their income, but also by their aspirations of either maintaining their status or achieving upward social mobility. We have classified eligible women into three social-status groups: low, medium and high, by an aggregated score that takes account of the following factors: (a) total household income; (6) household educational status; (c) housing; (d) landholding; and (e) possession of luxuries (for details, see Singh, 1990).
The caste has a socioreligious base. Caste beliefs, therefore, exert a strong and stable conditioning influence on human behavior, social habits, customs, and practices. Segregated, casteoriented living as is commonly practiced in villages, reinforces caste beliefs and habits. Therefore, the sample has been subdivided into broad groups: Muslims and upper, middle, and scheduled castes among Hindus (Huffman, et al., 1987; Nath et al., 1993; Srinivasan, 1989; Singh et al., 1994).
Mother's age at childbirth is known to be an important determinant in analyzing the interval from resumption of menses to next birth (Diamond et al., 1986; John et al., 1987; Nath et al., 1993). In countries such as India, where preference for male children

exists, breastfeeding patterns appear to depend on the infant's sex. In this study, we have examined the roles of woman's age and child's sex on the interval of interest.
The study data consist of two types of birth intervals. One is the closedintervalfor women who had experienced at least two live-birth conceptions before the survey date--the interval between the two births. The other is the open interval--\he duration from the date of birth of the last child to the survey date, for women who have not experienced a subsequent conception. These open intervals provide information that the subsequent conception time exceeds the time elapsed from the date of the index child to the date of survey. Only those open intervals are considered in which the menses are resumed before the reference date of the survey.
Because we have considered both complete and incomplete intervals at the time of survey, we used the life table technique (Namboodiri and Suchindran, 1987) to analyze the interval from resumption of menses to next conception. Life tables of length for interval between resumption of menses to next conception were constructed, and summary measures such as median length of the interval from resumption of menses to next conception were computed. We considered all closed and open birth intervals that occurred within the last seven years before the reference date of the survey to reduce recall lapse for intervals that began very long ago. Since the use of contraception is almost negligible in the survey area, to observe the impact of breastfeeding alone on the interval under study, we confined our analysis to

women who did not use any form of contraception during the interval.
The multivariate analysis of the duration of the interval from resumption of menses to next conception was achieved through hazards modeling (Cox, 1972). In the following models, the probability of conception depends on the elapsed duration of the menstrual interval and on a set of independent variables which describe the woman and the environment in which she lives. The independent variables fall into two classes: (1) fixed characteristics,which take the same value in every month of observation for a given woman, such as her religion and caste, household socioeconomic status, education, place of residence, etc.; and the variablecharacteristics, such as breastfeeding status which may take a different value in each month of observation. Because of this time-dependent nature of the breastfeeding variable, special attention was paid to obtain data on breastfeeding duration after resumption of menses and the interval between resumption of menses and next conception. The breastfeeding variables were examined in two separate specifications, done to ease interpretational difficulties with timedependent covariates and to reduce computer costs. The first model specifies the hazard of the event "conception after resumption of menses" as follows:

BREAST (t)

(1)

where XQ(0 is a baseline hazard, Xis a set of fixed covariates, and BREAST(t) is an indicator variable assuming a value 1 if the woman is breastfeeding t months after resumption of menses

and 0 if she is not breastfeeding. The p\ and p2 a r e unknown regression coefficients. Note that the indicator variable BREAST(t) simply examines whether or not breastfeeding status after resumption of menses at a given time (current status) influences the rate of conception at that time. Also, by interacting an independent variable with the BREAST(f) variable, one can examine the question whether the effect of current breastfeeding status after menses on the rate of conception varies among subgroups of the population defined by the variable. However, such specification of the breastfeeding after the return of menses variable does not account for the duration of breastfeeding, if it has stopped prior to the time point at which the hazard is estimated. To include the duration of breastfeeding, the following specification of the model was used:
log \{t) = log X0(t) + p\X + P2D(f) + $3[X*D(t)] (2)
where D(t) = minimum (f, duration of breastfeeding after resuming menses). Note that for women who have stopped breastfeeding before t, D(t) will be the duration of breastfeeding; and for those still continuing breastfeeding, D(t) will be the time point of consideration. Such specifications avoid the problem of indicating breastfeeding durations after menses longer than that of the length of interval from return to menses to next conception. The P3 coefficients measure the interactive effects of the duration of breastfeeding after menses and the set of independent variables.
Before applying the multivariate time-dependent hazards models, the data on duration of breastfeeding and

PPA were smoothed by using B-spline functions (SAS, 1990).
RESULTS
The median duration of total (full and partial) breastfeeding after resumption of menses was calculated for females in the study by univariate life table technique (Table 1). The overall median duration of breastfeeding is seen to be 16.26 and 13.35 months, respectively, with and without smoothing. Median durations of PPA obtained through life tables are also shown in Table 1. The median duration of PPA was found to be 7.82 and 5.82 months, respectively, with and without-smoothing. Life tables show that a high percentage of females resume menses before 3 months (not shown). This may be, in part, confusion of postpartum bleeding with first menses. There may also be downward bias in the median duration of PPA compared to the general population because we are considering only intervals in which PPA is already completed. Hence, the data may be over-represented by females who have shorter durations of PPA. Smoothing, in general, increased the average durations of breastfeeding and PPA.
We also present the median duration from resumption of menses to next conception (Table 1). For closed (uncensored) intervals at the time of survey, the time of conception was estimated by subtracting 9 months from the month of delivery. In the present study the status of females at the time of survey (pregnant or not) was known but the duration of pregnancy was not known. So, for females pregnant at the time of survey, the time of conception

was assigned by generating the duration of pregnancy by drawing a random number from a uniform distribution of a range of 8 months and treating these intervals as closed. The rest of the intervals are considered to be censored at the time of survey. The overall median duration of waiting time to conception after menstruation is found to be more than 15 months.
Table 2 presents the percentage distribution of females who were pregnant or nonpregnant at the time ofsurvey by selected characteristics. Much variation is observed according to pregnant status at the time of survey in two characteristics: place of residence, age of female at birth, and religion/ caste.
In Table 3 we give the results from fitting the first model with and without smoothing breastfeeding by cubic splines respectively. We have examined here the effect of current breastfeeding status on the hazard of conception. The regression analysis indicates that breastfeeding beyond menstruation at any given time reduces significantly the likelihood of conception,

even after controlling for sociodemographic characteristics under study in both cases.
Comparison of the results from the analysis indicates that heaping of breastfeeding and PPA (Table 3) show reduced effect on the chance of conception after menstruation. This finding means that if no smoothing adjustment is made, the rate of conception after menstruation is reduced by 47 per cent if the female is breastfeeding at that time. When smoothing adjustment is made, the reduction increases to 63 per cent, consistent with the attenuation effect of errors in variables noted in the regression model literature.
Many other factors included in the model also have a significant effect. Younger mothers at the child's birth have significantly higher rates of conception after return of menses than older mothers in both cases. Literate women have less chance of conception than the illiterate after menses; the difference is highly statistically significant. Rural women have a significantly smaller interval from menses to next conception than do urban women. The model was re-estimated by adding the interaction terms of the current status of breastfeeding after menses and other independent variables. None of the interaction terms are found to be statistically significant either before and after smoothing the breastfeeding and PPA.
The regression coefficient from the model specifying breastfeeding duration after menses and its interactive effect with duration of PPA with and without smoothing adjustment are given in Tables 4 and 5 respectively.

Results from Model 1in Tables 4 and5 show that breastfeeding duration hasa significant negative effect on the rate of conception after menses. For every additional month of breastfeeding, there is about a 1.8 per cent (3.3 per cent) reduction in the risk of conception after return of menses without (with) smoothing breastfeeding and PPA. The results once again show the attenuating effect of the heaping in duration data.
Model 2 in Table 4 examines theinteractive effect of breastfeeding after menses on the risk of conception. The

interactive effect of breastfeeding with the duration of PPA is found to bestatistically significant. Results show that if there is no breastfeeding, as the duration of PPA increases so does the risk of conception. However, breastfeeding attenuates the positive effect of duration of PPA. Here, smoothing increases the effect of breastfeeding duration on the risk of conception.
DISCUSSION
Waiting time to a conception is an important indicator of fecundity.
