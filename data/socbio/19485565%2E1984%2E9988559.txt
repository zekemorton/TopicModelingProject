ABSTRACT: Comparisons of age-discrepant marriages ideally involve data which are collected at the time of marriage and which are available by single years of age for the same population over time. Although such data are not available for Canadian-American comparisons, approximations of them are derived from the United States census, from marriage statistics (including statistics for California and for British Columbia), and from selected fortuitous studies of age at marriage. Although available data are not conclusive, they suggest that Canada and the United States do not differ markedly in the incidence of age-discrepant marriages and that both exhibit longitudinal trends which reflect a decreased incidence of marriages with large husband-wife age differences and an increased preference for coeval marriages, but exhibit markedly little change in the incidence of wife-older marriages. Cross-cultural patterns of age-discrepant marriages are suggested as an unobtrusive indicator for comparative assessments of the de facto status of women.

les, whether longitudinal or crossnational, should be based on data which meet three criteria: first, that they were collected at the time of marriage; second, that they include precise measures of age; and third, that they control for the major confounding variables. In reality, at this point in time, these specifications can only be approximated.
1. Vital Statistics Versus Census Data.--Vitalstatistics provide the most accurate method of assessing the incidence of age-discrepant marriages. Although such data are collected regularly in the United States, the coverage is not complete. For example, in 1969, marriage data considered sufficiently complete to warrant publications in totals for the Marriage Registration Areas constituted only 77 per cent of the national totals (Williams and Kunh, 1973, p. 24). If there remains no reason to believe that age-discrepant marriages are more or less likely to occur in areas included or not included in the marriage registration data, this is itself not a serious problem.
A more critical issue are problems intrinsic to the use of census data. A survey of all couples cannot measure all age-discrepant unions, but only those age-discrepant unions which have persevered to a given point in time. The differential life expectancy of men and women is well known; in most couples this fact, combined with a small age difference in favor of the wife, makes it much more likely that the marriage will eventually be terminated by his death rather than by hers. In husbandascendent marriages with a large age gap, this tendency is markedly pronounced. In contrast, the tendency is counter-balanced in wife-ascendent marriages, in that the probability of the husband's survivorship more closely ap-

proximates that of his wife. The result is that a cross-section of married couples of all ages will tend to be underweighted in terms of husband-older marriages and over-weighted in terms of wife-older marriages.
In both Canada and the United States, marriages are increasingly likely to be terminated by divorce rather than by death. There is some tentative evidence that age-discrepant couples may be more likely to divorce than are more conventional pairings (Monahan, 1953; Schmitt, 1969; Bumpass and Sweet, 1972). Whether this is a result of selection factors, or of the inferior quality of such marriages, the result is that the count of age-discrepant marriages will be further underestimated by reliance on census or survey data.
2. Precise Age Grading.--The best data for assessing age-discrepant marriages are those which give the exact age of the bride by the exact age of the groom. Unfortunately, many publications of vital statistics and of census data use only quinary groupings, which are imprecise and which underestimate the extent of husband-older marriages and overestimate the extent of wife-older ones (Veevers, 1983a). Such data are of some utility in doing preliminary work and in formulating hypotheses (Cox, 1970; Bytheway, 1981), but by their nature they perforce obscure subtle but important differences.
When marriage statistics are presented by single years of age, these rich data are frequently given only for young persons. Thus, in the United States detailed statistics are available for marriages in 1978, but only for persons age eighteen to twenty-nine (U. S. Vital Statistics, 1978). While this may be adequate for a study of first-time brides, it represents only 68per cent of all grooms

and particularly tends to obscure the atypical situation of an older man marrying a bride many years his junior. When that does occur, it is impossible to know the exact discrepancy. Although data for all marriages by single years of age for all ages would be ideal, data for all persons up to age 49 provide an acceptable approximation.
However data were originally collected, one is usually forced to deal with data as they are published. In the United States census, all couples with the husband ten or more years senior are combined, thereby obscuring the extent of variation at the extremes of the distribution. More problematic, however, is the adoption of a curious convention whereby data are combined for married persons who are the same age or have the husband one year younger, but are differentiated for couples in which the husband is one year older. In addition, all couples with the husband two or more years younger are aggregated, thereby obscuring the important distinction between wife-ascendent marriages which involve a three-year difference or a thirteen-year difference (Veevers, 1983c).
Even if data were available by single years of age, it would be difficult or impossible to assimilate them in this form. To be meaningful, it is necessary to group them in some way. Unfortunately, the categories of such groupings are almost entirely arbitrary. The perennial problem with cross-national comparisons is that different statistical agencies group data in idiosyncratic ways, with the result that published statistics cannot always be compared directly. In some instances, enough cross-national work has been done to establish conventions which now enjoy wide currency. Unfortunately, the question of agedifferences in marriage has not been ad-

dressed systematically, and so no conventions have yet been established. Comparisons therefore involve the torturous recombining of various data into a standard format. One pattern which is used by the State of Hawaii and some other agencies distinguishes exact same age and then presents data in terms of wide categories of husband-older or wife-older possibilities. While this is of some use, it might also be argued that, for all practical purposes, persons within one year of age are the "same" age. Moreover, since a wife being several years older than her husband is of more social significance than the other way around, grouping of all wife-older marriages into 1-4 years and 5-9 years tends to obscure small but important differences. The choice of a standard format is of course arbitrary and remains an issue of personal preference.
3. Confounding Variables. Although little work has been done on agediscrepant marriages, two factors which are known to be associated with them and which should be taken into account in comparisons are race and marital status.
In the United States, patterns of agediscrepant marriages are different for white than for nonwhite couples. Black couples tend to have slightly more couples with the wife older and, at the other end, slightly more couples with the husband markedly older than the wife. This was true in 1960 and remains true to 1970 (Veevers, 1983b). The racial composition of Canadians cannot be known exactly since racial origin is not asked on the Canadian census or vital statistics, but it can be assumed that most Canadians are white and that the most appropriate comparison groups would therefore be white Americans. Unfortunately, not all data available on marriages are differentiated by racial origin.

more years senior. By these criteria, age-discrepant marriages would seem to constitute 27.3 per cent of all American marriages, but only 8.6 per cent of all Canadian ones. However, two confounding variables may be operant. First, because the U.S. data presented here include both white and Black couples, it may be exaggerated compared with white Canadian couples. Second, data here is based on all marriages. Since divorce has consistently been higher in the United States than in Canada, part of the discrepancy may be due to the differing proportions of remarriages. When only primary marriages in the United States are considered, agediscrepant ones are observed to constitute only 3.3 per cent of the total, a figure closer to the Canadian count.
Although data are not available for nationwide comparisons, it may still be possible to make some comparisons for specific parts of the country. Data on all

marriages in 1977in California are available courtesy of special tabulations by Knupfer (1983). In some ways, British Columbia may be considered more comparable to California than the rest of Canada. Although the divorce rate there is not as high as in the United States, it is consistently and significantly higher than in the rest of Canada.1 Comparisons of California in 1977 with British Columbia in 1979 suggest quite close parallels in patterns of age-discrepant marriages (Table 2). In California, grooms ten or more years senior to their brides were involved in 8.8 per cent of
·In 1980 in Canada, the national divorce rate was 2.6 per 1,000. Historically, British Columbia has always had the highest rates of any province, reaching 3.6 per 1,000 that year. In the United States, the rate for 1980 was markedly higher, 5.2 per 1,000. California does not have as high an incidence as some other states but its 1980 rate of 5.7 per 1,000 was considerably above the national average (U.S. Health, Education, and Welfare, 1982, p. 14).

all marriages, compared with 9.5 per cent in British Columbia. At the other end of the distribution, brides five or more years senior to their grooms constituted 4.8 per cent of all brides in California and 4.5 per cent of all brides in British Columbia. In both instances, therefore, age-discrepant unions were about one in seven of all marriages, a proportion probably higher than national averages in either country (Veevers, 1983a).
LONGITUDINAL TRENDS
The best data on longitudinal trends would involve marriage statistics on a single population over time, as for example those available for British Columbia since 1921 (Veevers, 1983a). Since data of these kind are not widely available, one alternative is to consider data from the census. The Canadian census does not publish detailed data on age of husband by age of wife. In the United States, however, such data are available from a special survey done in

1948 and have been available routinely since 1960, as shown in Table 3. Although the grouping of the data does not permit precise measures, the data do suggest a slight convergence of age differences and a slight increase in the proportion of marriages with the wife older by at least two years.
Since only a few censuses have included data on age discrepancies, they do not provide much scope for the analysis of long-term trends. However, a patient perusal of the family literature having anything to do with age did yield some relevant studies. The earliest and most comprehensive was the work of Duncan (1934) on all marriages in Stillwater, Oklahoma from 1895 to 1932. Unfortunately for our purposes, these data were not presented by year or even decade of marriage. Bossard (1933) examined all marriages which took place in Philadelphia in 1932. In the course of work on intermarriage and divorce, Schmitt (1969) provided data on Hawaii; similarly, in the course of work on remarriage, Kunz (1981) pro-

husband-older marriages are more acceptable and more common than comparable wife-older ones. It seems unlikely that accounting for the ubiquity of this pattern required any amorphous assumptions about human nature. Rather, it may simply reflect the extent to which women, compared with men have had unequal access to resources, with a resulting diminishing of options and of the will and the wherewithall of self-determination. The result of these factors, combined with others, has usually been that when confronted with the costs and compensations--both intrinsic and extrinsic--which are an inevitable part of the mate selection process, the bargaining power of women has been markedly less than the bargaining power of men. If these assumptions can be sustained, then patterns of age-discrepant marriages might be considered an unob-

trusive cross-cultural measure of the de facto status of women in a given place and time. Further research is therefore needed to determine if distributions of age-discrepant marriages do vary and, if so, how such variation is concomitant with other social indicators.
