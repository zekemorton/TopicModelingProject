ABSTRACT: This study provides a direct test of whether the observed similarity of spouses isdue to initial assortment rather than to convergence of phenotypes. With data from three well-known longitudinal studies, phenotypic convergence is examined using both variable- and personcentered analyses. The longitudinal evidence does not support the hypothesis that couples increasingly resemble each other with time. Spouse correlations most likely reflect initial assortment at marriage and not the convergence of phenotypes.

People tend to marry partners who are similar to themselves. Indeed,positive marital assortment has beendocumented for physical characteristics, cognitive abilities, values and attitudes, and personality traits (Epstein and Guttman, 1984; Jensen, 1978; Vandenberg, 1972). Moreover, it appears that similarities between spouses reflect active personal preferences and are not simply the outcome of social homogamy (Mascie-Taylor andVandenberg, 1988).
Assortative mating has important genetic consequences (Thiessen and Gregg, 1980). For example, assortative mating for a trait with a geneticcomponent will produce a population distribution for that trait that differs from the distribution that would obtain under conditions of random mating.
Assortative mating also has social consequences (Mare, 1991). Thus, even if there is no genetic component to the traits for which there is assortative mating, couples will, on average, differ more from other couples than they would under conditions of random mating. Moreover, to the extent that parent-child resemblance is re-

lated to environmental factors associated with these traits, entire families will differ from each other (Willerman, 1979).
Assortative mating may also have important implications for the course of personality development in adulthood. In particular, similarities between spouses might create anenvironment that reinforces initial tendencies (Buss, 1984a). Newcomb's classic study of students at Bennington College provides an example of this process in the domain of attitudes. The political liberalism acquired by the women while at Bennington in the 1930's was sustained over the subsequent 25 years of their lives, in partbecause they selected liberal friends and husbands who continued to providesocial support for their politically liberal attitudes (Newcomb, 1943; Newcomb et al., 1967). More recently, Caspiand Herbener (1990) have argued that by selecting environments that are correlated with their dispositions people may set in motion processes of social interchange that sustain their dispositions across time and circumstance. They demonstrated this active

genotype-environment effect (cf. Plomin et al., 1977; Scarr and McCartney, 1983) by showing that marriage to a similar other promotes consistency in the intraindividual organization of personality attributes across adulthood.
One problem, however, continues to plague behavioral genetics research on assortative mating for psychological characteristics. Most studies measure realized assortment--the degree of similarity that is present after some years of marriage--rather than initial assortment (Price and Vandenberg, 1980). Realized assortment may reflect initial assortment, but it may also reflect the convergence of phenotypes during marriage as a result of reciprocal influences or of shared living conditions and other common environmental experiences (Rowe and Plomin, 1981). In addition, the extent to which phenotypic convergence occurs has important methodological and conceptual implications for family studies which investigate parent-offspring resemblance (Zonderman et al., 1977). To date, the only information on changes in spouse resemblance has been obtained indirectly in crosssectional studies. In this article, we offer a more rigorous examination of phenotypic convergence using three longitudinal studies of marital dyads.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDIES OF
PHENOTYPIC CONVERGENCE
Previous investigations of convergence have proceeded indirectly by asking whether couples who are married longer are more similar than those

who have been married briefly. Price and Vandenberg (1980) recommended using a hierarchical multiple regression analysis to test the hypothesis that husband-wife pairs may resemble each other increasingly with time. In this procedure, years of marriage is entered in the first step, one spouse's score on a given variable is entered in the second step, and the interaction term is entered in the third step. The statistical significance of the interaction term provides a test of whether older couples are more or less similar to each other than are younger couples. Convergence is indicated by a positive sign associated with the interaction term; divergence is indicated by a negative sign associated with the interaction term.
With data on their American sample, Price and Vandenberg (1980) estimated 44 such models. Only eight variables showed convergence, and these were confined to "plastic variables" such as time spent in social activity, and alcohol and food consumption. Buss (19846) carried out a similar analysis with 93 married American couples in their mid-20s to mid-30s. Eighty-nine multiple regressions were performed on scales from a large battery of personality tests. Significant interaction terms were found in 13 models; of these only 2 showed convergence and the remaining 11 scales pointed to divergence. If anything, longer married spouses appeared to be less similar to each other than spouses married only briefly. However, members of this sample were relatively young and had been married for a short period of time. An examination of a sample with a less restricted range might provide more reliable evidence.

Guttman and Zohar (1987), with a sample of 138 Israeli couples, examined the distribution of mean absolute spouse differences with length of marriage for the seven Comrey Personality Scale dimensions. The couples had been married from between 1 to 22 years. There is little evidence in their scattergrams to support the conclusion that spouses converge (or diverge) over the course of marriage.
To examine convergence in IQ scores and personality traits during marriage, Mascie-Taylor (1989) correlated the absolute difference scores between husbands and wives with years of marriage. This analysis, carried out with two British samples, did not provide any evidence pointing to convergence. In addition, Mascie-Taylor (1989) performed the hierarchical regressions recommended by Price and Vandenberg (1980) and found a significant interaction effect in only 1 of the 26 regression models examined. Finally, Watkins and Meredith (1981) compared spouse correlations on tests of specific cognitive abilities from their sample of 215 newlywed spouses with the correlations from other samples of American couples to explore the possible effects of cohabitation on spouse similarities. The results revealed no consistent differences between newlyweds and couples who had been married for longer periods of time. Whatever resemblance is present in abilities appears to be present in initial stages of the marriage as well.
The single demonstration of phenotypic convergence has been reported in a clever experiment. Zajonc and his colleagues (1988) asked subjects to judge the physical similarity of couples on the basis of photographs taken

when the couples were first married and again 25 years later. The results showed that the physical resemblance of spouses, as judged by the subjects, was significantly greater after a quarter-century of cohabitation. Compelling though this analysis may appear, some caution is in order for the experiment also revealed that the spouses, when first married, were not perceived as more similar to each other than randomly paired couples. This finding contradicts Spuhler's (1968) data and a substantial body of social psychological research on physical attractiveness (Berscheid, 1985).
In sum, the hypothesis that spouses converge over the course of marriage has received little support in crosssectional studies. It appears that initial assortment may be the probable cause of obtained spouse correlations. Crosssectional studies, however, provide equivocal approximations of longitudinal trends (Nesselroade and Baltes, 1979). Thus, it remains important for behavioral genetics analysis to determine whether spouse similarities are due to initial assortment or to convergence over time.
We shall examine this question with data from three well-known longitudinal studies: (1) the Kelly Longitudinal Study, (2) the Berkeley Guidance Study, and (3) the Oakland Growth Study. The first data set affords a test of phenotypic convergence for values and attitudes across twenty years beginning with engagement. The latter two data sets permit us to examine phenotypic convergence in interpersonal dispositions across middle adulthood. In addition, the Berkeley and Oakland studies enable us to employ a personcentered analysis as an alternative

to more traditional variable-centered analyses in order to examine whether couples increasingly resemble each other across middle adulthood.
RESULTS
STUDY I . SPOUSE SIMILARITY FOR
VALUES AND ATTITUDES:
ENGAGEMENT AND 20 YEARS HENCE
Data for this analysis were obtained from the Kelly Longitudinal Study. The KLS is an especially appropriate data set with which to examine the hypothesis of phenotypic convergence. It is a relatively large longitudinal study of marital dyads, spanning twenty years beginning with engagement (see Kelly, 1955).
Three hundred couples were initially contacted when they were engaged. The initial assessment program thus took place before marriage. A twenty-year follow-up was conducted in 1953-54. One hundred and sixty-five couples whose marriages had remained intact provided complete data during the second assessment program.
At both time periods, subjects completed the Study of Values. This instrument aims to measure six basic interests or motives in personality: the theoretical, economic, aesthetic, social, political and religious. Although the revised (1951) form increased the reliability of the test (especially the social value), the original (1931) form of this instrument was used on both measurement occasions in the KLS in order to ensure the comparability of scales across time (cf. Allport et al., 1970; Vernon and Allport, 1931). Because the social value on the original form had unacceptable reliability we have

excluded this scale from our analysis. Attitudes toward marriage were as-
sessed in both 1935-38 and 1954-55 with the "Views about the Ideal Marriage" questionnaire (Kelly, 1955). Factor analyses with oblique rotation were performed on the 33 5-point scale items (1 = very essential; 5 = not desirable) separately by sex and assessment period. Four reliable factors emerged from these analyses: Fidelity ("After marriage the wife should be 100 per cent faithful to her husband in regard to sex"; "After marriage the husband should be 100 per cent faithful to his wife in regard to sex"); Premarital Sex ("Wife should not have had sexual intercourse with any other man before marriage"; "Husband should not have had sexual intercourse with any other woman before marriage"); Companionship ("Husband and wife should have similar intellectual interests"; "Husband and wife should engage in the same outdoor sports"; "Husband and wife should like the same types of amusements"; "Husband and wife should be about equally fond of social gatherings"); and Daily Activities ("Children should be given religious instruction"; "Household affairs should be run in a neat and orderly manner"; "Children should be held to strict discipline"; "Husband and wife should frequently express their love for each other in words"; "Husband and wife should each respect the other's religious, political, or ethical convictions and not strive to change them"; "The wife should be allowed a definite budget for the household and for her personal expenditures").

spouse similarity at two points during the course of marriage. Tables 1 and2 shows these results.
The magnitude of the spouse correlations for the five values on the Allport-Vernon Scale is low-to-moderate and positive at both time periods (Table 1). These correlations aresimilar to those reported by Schooley (1936) in the only other study of marital assortment which included the Study of Values. Moreover, the spouse correlations are similar at both time periods in the present study. The mean spouse correlation across the five values is 0.36on the first measurement occasion and 0.39 on the second measurement occasion.
The magnitude of the spouse correlations for the four attitudinal factors is generally low and positive at both time periods (Table 2). Moreover, the cor-

relations are similar at both time periods. The mean spouse correlation across the four factors is 0.21 on the first measurement occasion and0.23on the second measurement occasion.
The hypothesis that obtained spouse correlations are due to convergence over the course of marriage receives no support in these data. Initial assortment in personal values and attitudes toward marriage is comparable in magnitude to the phenotypic similarity that is realized twenty years later.
STUDY 2: SPOUSE SIMILARITY FOR
INTERPERSONAL DISPOSITIONS ACROSS
MIDDLE ADULTHOOD
Data for this study were obtained from the archives of the Institute of Human Development (IHD) at the University of California, Berkeley (see Eichorn, 1981). In the present analysis, we focus on members of two longitudinal studies: (1) Berkeley Guidance Study females (N = 22) and males (N = 20),both groups with birth dates in 1928-29, and their spouses; (2) Oakland Growth Study females (N = 17) and males (N = 23), both groups with birth dates in 1920-21, and their spouses. In all, data are available on 82 couples. These couples have provided data on two occasions, in 1970 and in 1981. All the couples remained married to each other over this time period.
At both time periods, participants completed the California Psychological Inventory (CPI). The CPI was designed to assess normal personality characteristics important in everyday life (Megargee, 1972). The 1987edition of the CPI contains 20 folk scales, instead of the 18appearing in the prior

with the mean correlations from the longer-standing marriages of the older Berkeley and Oakland couples (average r = 0.20 and 0.14) reveals strikingly similar results.
A comparison of these independent investigations may buttress the evidence against phenotypic convergence, but it may also reveal important secular change in marital assortment or the equally important absence thereof. Indeed, noteworthy patterns emerge when the CPI scales from the two studies are grouped into more global domains (cf. Gough, 1987). The mean spouse correlations for scales that index "internalization and endorsement of normative conventions" (Responsibility, Socialization, Selfcontrol, Good Impression, Communality, Tolerance, Well-being) and, to a lesser extent, "thinking and behavior" (Psychological-mindedness, Flexibility, Femininity/Masculinity) remain relatively constant across time in our study (average r = 0.24 and 0.26 for each domain on the first occasion, and 0.25 and 0.11 for each domain on the second occasion) and are similar to those calculated in the cross-sectional study by Buss (average r = 0.16 and 0.27 for each domain). Similarly, the spouse correlations for scales that assess "cognitive and intellectual functioning" (Achievement via Conformance, Achievement via Independence, Intellectual Efficiency) remain stable across time in our study (average r = 0.24 and 0.22) and are similar in magnitude to the mean spouse correlation calculated in the Buss sample (0.22). This latter finding appears to support the claim that there has been no secular decline in marital assortment for variables related to cognitive

abilities and educational attainment (Heath et al., 1985; Johnson et al., 1980; Mare, 1991;Rockwell, 1976).
However, important differences between the two studies emerge on CPI scales that assess "interpersonal style and manner of dealing with others" (Dominance, Capacity for Status, Sociability, Social Presence, Self-acceptance). Whereas the mean spouse correlations for these five scales are 0.12 and -0.01 in our study, the mean spouse correlation in the Buss sample is 0.30. The most striking differences between the two studies emerge on Dominance, Capacity for Status, and Social Presence. It is unlikely that these differences are merely attributable to differences in educational attainment as the couples in both studies are quite well-educated. It is more likely that shifts in marital preferences have accompanied more recent and egalitarian times with a commensurate trend toward positive assortment on traits that measure poise, ascendancy, and self-assurance.
In sum, the longitudinal data across middle adulthood provide no evidence that couples increasingly resemble each other with time. Furthermore, the spouse correlations among middleaged couples are similar to the correlations reported among newly-married couples. In combination, these findings support the view that spouse correlations are most likely not due to theconvergence of phenotypes.
Traditional correlational indices of spouse similarity, however, do not afford inferences about the specific similarity of any couple in the sample; they only reflect the relative position or rank order of couples in a sample. To accurately reflect the similarity of each

independent judges' placements of each of the 100 items. The average reliability of the case composites for the males and females included in this report is 0.74.
To assess the personality similarity of couples, we correlated the Q-sort description of each husband with the Q-sort description of his wife from the same measurement occasion. These correlations are descriptive indices of similarity between two persons on one occasion, with possible values ranging from --1 (complete dissimilarity) to + 1 (complete similarity).
The advantage of these indices is that they reference the similarity of each couple within the sample. Unlike assessments of similarity in traditional variable-centered research, these indices do not require reference to other sample members to derive their meaning. The disadvantage of these indices, however, is that they do not yield information about the similarity of couples along any single attribute (Buss, 1985). Indeed, Cronbach and Gleser (1953) noted long ago that we can only discuss similarity as a general quality of personality with respect to a set of complex characteristics. Thus, if we find people who are similar to each other we can assume that they are generally similar only if the original measurement covered a large proportion of the significant dimensions of personality. The 100 California Q-set items arguably capture most of the fundamental dimensions of interest to personality psychologists (cf. McCrae et al., 1986).
It should be noted, in addition, that similarity scores based on standard Pearson product-moment correlations ignore both the elevation and scatter

components of profile similarity. However, this shortcoming is obviated in the present analysis by the Q-sort methodology where the number of descriptive statements placed in each category is fixed so the resultant distribution is normal in form.
Results. --Table 4 reports the distributions of the correlations between Q-sort descriptions of couples in the Berkeley and Oakland samples on two measurement occasions. These correlations represent the similarity of each couple's personalities. As the Table shows, the mean correlations of 0.32 and 0.40 are similar for the couples in both samples on both measurement occasions.
Do these profile similarities differ reliably from similarities that would emerge under conditions of random assortment? It should be noted that the dyadic correlations cannot be interpreted in the same way as assortative mating coefficients obtained in variable-centered analyses. In particular, their expected value is not necessarily zero and their sampling distribution is not known (Ozer and Gjerde, 1989). In order to establish a criterion for significance, we created the elements required for a significance test within our own samples. Specifically, within each time period, each subject's Q-sort profile was correlated with the Q-sort profiles of all oppositesex subjects. This procedure yields a matrix in which the diagonal values are the actual profile similarities between couples and the off-diagonal values represent the similarity between subjects' Q-sorts with unrelated, oppositesex subjects' Q-sorts. The means of random samples taken from the offdiagonal values can be compared with

the mean of the diagonal values to assess whether similarity occurs at levels that exceed random assortment.
In each time period and for each sample, Berkeley and Oakland, we generated 100 random samples for comparison with the profile similarities of real couples. In the Berkeley sample, the 100 trials yielded 1 value that exceeded the sample mean (0.32) in 1970 and 3 values that exceeded the sample mean (0.40) in 1981. In the Oakland sample, the 100 trials yielded 14 values that exceeded the sample mean (0.32) in 1970 and 4 values that exceeded the sample mean (0.40) in 1981. In general, then, the personcentered approach yields evidence pointing to a modest degree of spouse similarity.
Do married couples increasingly resemble each other across time? To address this question we first corrected the profile similarities by an estimate of the dyadic correlation that would be obtained in random assortments. This procedure is critical, as the baseline for the random correlation of any two Q-sorts is not 0.00, but probably closer to 0.2. In the present study, positive base values are expected, given the shared culture and geography of the

sample and raters. In addition, it is possible that the base values mayfluctuate as a function of the age of the sample being rated (Ozer and Gjerde, 1989).
To estimate the base correlations in the two samples, Berkeley and Oakland, we correlated each female subject's Q-sort description with the Q-sorts of all male subjects (cf. Ozer and Gjerde, 1989). This operation was performed four times, separately for each measurement occasion in each sample. For example, the 75 Berkeley female Q-sorts were each correlated with the 75 Berkeley male Q-sorts from the 1970 assessment. The average of the 5,625 (75 x 75) similarity profiles represents the base profile. The base similarities obtained from this matrix, as well as from the T2 Berkeley matrix (75 x 75), the Tx Oakland matrix (51 x 51), and the T2 Oakland matrix (51 x 51), were then used as the divisors in correcting the actual profile similarities in each sample.
To test for phenotypic convergence, the corrected profile similarities were used in a one-way repeated measures analysis of variance with time as the repeated factor. The results do not support the hypothesis that couples

become more similar over time. This is true in both Berkeley, F(l,74) = 1.96, p = 0.17, and Oakland, F(l,50) = 0.13, ns. In neither sample do couples increasingly resemble each other across the course of their marriage during middle adulthood.
CONCLUSION
This study makes two contributions to the study of marital assortment. It offers a direct test of phenotypic convergence and presents a personcentered alternative to traditional variable-centered analyses of spouse similarity.
Previous cross-sectional studies have provided little support for the hypothesis that obtained spouse correlations result from increased similarity over time. The present study substantiates these claims with longitudinal data by demonstrating that spouse correlations are unlikely to change (a) across a span of twenty years beginning with engagement and (6) across a tenyear period during middle adulthood. The results generally support previous studies that show low but consistently positive correlations between spouses and suggest, in addition that these correlations are unlikely to change as a result of cohabitation and the convergence of phenotypes.
Importantly, these conclusions are supported by both variable- and person-centered approaches to the study of spouse similarity. Variablecentered approaches to the study of marital assortment reflect only one facet of spouse similarity--the relative position of husbands and wives in a sample of couples. In contrast, the person-centered approach affords in-

ferences about the similarity of any specific couple in the sample. Although the two approaches are conceptually distinct, they merit parallel examination. Thus, the person-centered approach employed in the present study supplements the variable-centered approach and provides convergent evidence that obtained spouse correlations are most likely not the result of the convergence of phenotypes over time.
In conclusion, two cautionary notes are issued. Although the present study has failed to identify significant phenotypic convergence for values, attitudes toward marriage, interpersonal dispositions, and the organization of personality attributes, it is possible that convergence is simply restricted to malleable role behaviors as well as to relatively plastic variables (e.g., eating habits, social activities) that are more likely to be altered in the course of an ongoing relationship (Price and Vandenberg, 1982). In addition, this study has not addressed the processes that contribute to spouse similarity. Although the estimates of spouse similarity remain relatively constant across the course of marriage, it remains to be determined whether the psychological and environmental processes that produce initial assortment are identical to those processes that produce enduring similarities between couples (Caspi et al., 1992).
