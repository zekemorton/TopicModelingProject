ABSTRACT: Reported here are the results of a survey inquiring into the rate of acceptance of four sociobiological concepts in regard to their usefulness for future research. Included in the survey were members of four subdisciplines: animal behavior (biology), biological anthropology, cultural anthropology, and developmental psychology. Three types of institutions were included: universities, four- and five-year colleges, and community colleges. A total of 1,631 responses are reported with the degree of acceptance varying from highest to lowest as follows: biology, biological anthropology, developmental psychology, and cultural anthropology. These variations are related to the central concepts of each subdiscipline.

This paper details the results of an investigation into the rates of acceptance of some of sociobiology's key concepts in the subdisciplines of animal behavior, cultural anthropology, developmental psychology, and biological anthropology. We are not concerned here with assessing the empirical correctness of the concepts.1 We limit ourselves to examining the sociocultural diffusion and acceptance of the concepts across four academic subdisciplines whose members are acquainted with sociobiology's key concepts and have actively debated the conceptual and social issues raised by their usage.

Its stated purpose was to gather information helpful in describing and understanding the emerging diversity of viewpoints on sociobiology. Respondents were asked to address the following question: "To what degree do you think each of the following sociobiological concepts might be useful in future research on human behavior?" Answers were on a five-point Likert scale including "very useful, useful, undecided, probably not useful, very unlikely to be useful."

The 88 respondents were members of departments of Anthropology, Social Science, Sociology, Psychology, Natural Science, and Zoology. The present study adds to the findings of Cathey and Brown by being based on a total of 1,631 persons in four subdisciplines situated in three types of educational institutions: those granting the Ph.D. degree, those four- and five-year universities granting the Master's and/or Bachelor's degree, and two-year community colleges granting the Associate of Arts or Science degree. The size of the populations and the frequency of responses allows us to compare subdisciplines at the three institutions and make inferences about their differences in relation to the central concepts of each subdiscipline.2
The four concepts whose usefulness was evaluated were as follows: kin selection, reciprocal altruism, malefemale reproduction strategy, and the genetic basis for altruism. Kin selection and reciprocal altruism have become the most widely known of the concepts of sociobiology. Kin selection refers to action at some cost to ego which favors the fertility of siblings, cousins, and other collateral kin to the degree that they carry ego's genes. Sociobiologists assume that genetic similarity is known or recognizable and that there are genetic predispositions for such altruistic behavior (Hamilton, 1964; Wilson, 1975). Reciprocal altruism occurs
2An alternative hypothese which will be reported in the above book concerns whether the respondent's knowledge of sociobiological concepts influences acceptance of them. Briefly stated, crosstabulation of self-reported familiarity with acceptance of the concepts is far less productive than is the relationship to the subdisciplines. Kind of activity (such as research, publishing, teaching, etc.) shows a somewhat stronger relationship, but the discipline is still the more powerful explanatory tool.

when ego, acting at some personal cost, favors the fertility of nonkin in the expectation of future reciprocity (Trivers, 1971). Male-female reproduction strategy refers to a wide variety of behaviors resulting in copulatory access to persons of the opposite sex, but also involving care and differential survival of offspring (Trivers, 1971; Gray, 1985). The genetic basis of altruism is an essential assumption, since sociobiology is derived from evolutionary biology with its keystone concept that natural selection modifies gene frequencies. We propose that the perceived utility of each of these concepts will vary with the central concepts of each of the four subdisciplines in this study.
THE SAMPLE
The rates of returned and usable questionnaires from the study's various subdisciplines are as follows:
Biologistsspecializing in animal behavior: Eighty-one per cent (147) of specialists in animal behavior teaching in Ph.D.-granting departments and 57 per cent (111) of specialists working in four- and five-year institutions returned usable questionnaires. Both of these populations were random selections from the membership list of the Animal Behavior Society. Usable questionnaires were returned from 47 per cent (154) of the mailing to community colleges. Letters were addressed to Instructor of Biology. The community colleges selected were from the Directoryof the American Association of Community and Junior Colleges if the full-time faculty numbered 50 with 1,000 or more students and if they were located in or adjacent to a county of 50,000 or more population.

A high degree of pro-sociobiological consensus in each discipline is indicated when a majority of its respondents agree that the four core concepts are useful research tools. Such a degree of consensus is found among animal behaviorists at all three types of educational institutions where all four concepts are favored by a clear majority. Three of the four basic concepts find favor among biological anthropologists at institutions granting Ph.D. and BA/MA degrees, but only "malefemale reproductive strategy" receives majority support among biological an* thropologists teaching in junior colleges.
Developmental psychologists at Ph.D.-granting institutions failed to provide majority support for any of sociobiology's four elementary concepts. Male-female reproductive strategy is the only concept receiving majority support among psychologists at BA/MA institutions. However, three of the four basic concepts enjoy majority support from psychologists at twoyear colleges.
Among cultural anthropologists, only the concept of "male-female reproductive strategy" receives majority support and only from those teaching in two-year institutions. There obviously is a sharp division within the field of anthropology with respect to the usefulness of sociobiology's key concepts. Biological anthropologists tend to embrace them, and many cultural anthropologists openly reject them (Lieberman, 1989).
The concepts viewed from the highest percentage of acceptance to the lowest were: male-female reproductive strategy, kin selection, reciprocal al-

truism, and the genetic basis of altruism. Skepticism about the genetic basis of altruism was indicated by the undecided or disagree responses which ranged from an overall average of about 40 per cent in animal behavior to 75 per cent in cultural anthropology. In the Cathey and Brown (1986) study a related question asked whether the respondent believed that "innate" behavior is common in humans. Half the respondents in the six disciplines, taken as a unit, were neutral or did not know, and another large portion were neutral or did not know. The data reported here clarify the variation on this kind of issue by discipline with the same order reported for the overall pattern in the opening paragraph of this section. It is remarkable that responses from Ph.D. and BA/MA institutions in each subdiscipline on the four concepts are very close together, except at the Ph.D.-level in anthropology. The largest and most consistent degree of difference (ranging from 9 per cent to 17 per cent) is found between those two institutional types on the one hand and two-year colleges on the other. Among biologists and biological anthropologists, those teaching at two-year schools tend to be less accepting of sociobiological concepts, but among cultural anthropologists and developmental psychologists those teaching at junior colleges are more accepting of these same concepts.

havior. By contrast sociobiology is concerned only with social behavior. Origins of the study of behavior as an expression of instincts is attributed to Lorenz (1937), the founder of ethology in Europe, who believed that different behaviors could be studied and explained as if they were like organs of the body. Lorenz placed the behaviors he observed in an evolutionary perspective. The concepts of sociobiology were derived from evolutionary theory, also known as the modern synthesis (Fisher, 1930; Wright, 1931; Huxley, 1942),andtromethology (Hamilton, 1964; Trivers, 1971). Wilson (1975) referred to this as the new synthesis.The modern synthesis is the conceptual foundation embraced by much of modern biology and physical anthropology. The extent of the adoption of the new synthesis is the topic of this paper.
The very high percentages of support for the first three concepts (Table 1) is closely related to the conceptual focus shared by biologists. These three concepts are supported at Ph.D. and BA/MA institutions by 76 per cent or more of respondents. By contrast, support for the "genetic basis of altruism ranges" from 53 per cent to 66 per cent. This lower frequency of acceptance may result from the view that identifying genetic bases for altruism is impossible or very difficult; or it may be that the respondents believe that the central theorems of sociobiology can and should be tested without reference to genes (see Barash, 1977).
If "kin selection" is derived from the modern evolutionary theory which biologists support, why do not 100 per cent of animal behaviorists support it? Part of the resistance may trace back to

the recognition that its genetic basis is assumed, but difficult to prove. Resistance may also relate to the debate in the 1950's in which some animal behaviorists and psychologists challenged Lorenz' emphasis on innate response patterns and the neglect of learning theory (Beach, 1955; Schneirla, 1956). Most simply, there may also be an avoidance of controversy among some biologists, and the feeling that sociobiologists claim too much explanatory power in regard to the behavior of the human species.
Cultural anthropology is the largest branch of anthropology. The discipline has been committed to three central concepts: race, culture, and evolution (Stocking, 1968). But the degree of commitment to these concepts varies. There is a duality in the cultural branch, where the central concept is culture, but it views itself as being holistic in also embracing the biological nature of humankind. For many cultural anthropologists, the synthesis of biological and cultural evolution holds that biological evolution made human intelligence, language, and culture possible, but does not determine their diversity (Leeds, 1977; Sahlins, 1976). Further, once complex human culture was possible it became the major mode of adaptation, reducing the likelihood of biological adaptation, with exceptions being recognized, but stress being placed on how culture alters gene frequencies such as in the case of the sickle cell allele (Livingstone, 1958). Given this emphasis, it is no surprise that cultural anthropologists respond least favorably (Table 1) to sociobiological concepts which claim to explain an ever-expanding variety of human behaviors from rape to who accompa-

played by biological anthropology in supporting racism and eugenics in the United States and Germany in the past. Konner (1982, p. 445) believes it is healthy and understandable that anthropologists "are resisting the new currents of biological determinism." Another source of resistance among sociobiological anthropologists (Tanner and Zihlman, 1976), is the continuing acceptance by sociobiologists of the scenario of "man, the hunter" as an adequate explanation for aggression and a male-dominated division of labor (see Wilson, 1978).
Developmentalpsychology is a major subdiscipline of psychology. It can trace its ancestry to Darwin, Haeckel, Freud, and Piaget. It draws upon and contributes to such fields as behavior genetics and ethology. Developmental psychology is defined in one text as "the scientific discipline concerned with describing age-related changes in the behavior and mental processes of both humans and animals and then explaining how nature and nurture through their interactions produce these changes" (McGraw, 1988, p. 6). Darwin's theory, Haeckel's idea that ontogeny recapitulates phytogeny, and the search for the origins of adult behavior patterns in the roots of early childhood entered into the origin of developmental psychology. The field also had its origin in the nature-nurture issue, which Richard Lerner (1976) refers to as "the core conceptual issue" of developmental psychology.4
4The nature-nurture issue boiled over in 1976 when 50 psychologists and other scientists signed a letter deploring the situation in which "it is virtually heresy to . . . recommend further study of the biological bases of behavior." The response and debate that followed is in Tobach and Proshansky (1976).

The nature-nurture controversy embroiled developmentalists "only 30 years ago" (Shaffer, 1989, p. 102), but "the prevailing contemporary viewpoint is that developmental changes in human behavior result from genetic and environmental factors acting together, with each playing a crucial role" (Friedrich and Van Horn, 1976, p. 6, emphasis added). This dual emphasis on nature and nurture interacting involves utilizing a:
holistic perspective. . . that emphasizes the important interrelationships among the physical, mental, social, and emotional aspects of human development . . . and a theoretical eclecticism involving psychoanalytic, behavioristic, cognitive-developmental, information processing, ethological and behavior genetic viewpoints. . . . (Shaffer, 1989, vi).
Given this emphasis on the relationship of nature and nurture, it is unexpected that the mean for acceptance of the four core sociobiological concepts is only 43 per cent, especially given the holistic, eclectic, and interactionist credo of developmental psychology.
Some light is cast on this by Shaffer (1989, p. 39) who lists five basic questions posed by the theoriesof developmental psychology: (1) Is human nature inherently good or bad? (2) Is human development influenced primarily by nature or nurture? (3) Is the child an active or a passive recipient of social and biological influences? (4) Is development a continuous process or are there more abrupt shifts from stage to stage? (5) Are there unusual paths that children follow in development? If the theories differ, should we not expect developmental psychologists to differ? For example, one textbook au-

thor states: "This book strives to present a particular point of view on human development--that is, human development is determined in large measure by biological factors; commonly, these interact with environmental and social factors. This interaction is not denied" (Nash, 1978, p. 1). We can expect that other developmental psychologists would lean the other way, and some would claim balance, and others would state that it depends on the phenomena studied at a given point in time.
In a paper concerning the relationship of sociobiology to topics in human development, Smith (1987) stresses the importance of concepts of inclusive fitness, kin investment, evolutionary stable strategy, learning rules, geneculture transmissions. But he then states that "evolutionary thinking has not had a major impact on mainstream developmental research" (1987, p. 238). Smith attributes this to several obstacles, or misconceptions, about sociobiological explanation including the "feeling" that: (1) Evolutionary forces do not adequately explain contemporary human developments. (2) Evolutionary explanations are not compatible with traditional views such as learning theory. (3) Cognition, learning, and culture are far more important for human development than is the case for any other animal. (4) Evolutionary explanations can apply to simpler reflexes but not more complex be-

haviors. (5) Evolutionary concepts emphasize individual "genetic differences." (6) Evolutionary views assume that environmental intervention to improve conditions is limited to biology. (7) That few gene-to-behavior pathways have been traced in humans.
CONCLUSION
The fact that there is no prevailing emphasis on one or the other side of the nature-nurture issue in developmental psychology contrasts with the existence of such a commitment in biology, biological anthropology, and cultural anthropology, and it also relates to the pattern of responses in which the highest frequency of undecided answers is generally found among developmental psychologists. To the extent that the developmental psychologists in our sample lean in one direction, they lean away from the concepts of sociobiology. That puts them in the company of cultural anthropologists who also reject sociobiological concepts, but do so more emphatically. Cultural anthropology is a social sciencesubdiscipline. Animal behaviorists and biological anthropologists represent natural science subdisciplines. Developmental psychology is lodged between the natural and social sciences. This pattern as much as any other may explain the acceptance rates presented here.
