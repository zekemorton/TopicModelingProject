ABSTRACT: In this paper we applied a recently developed statistical technique, hazard modelling, to the study of menarche and adolescent subfecundity. Using data collected in Bangladesh in 1976 and 1977, which included anthropometric and socioeconomic status measures, we found that age and weight were significant predictors of menarche; no other measure of growth significantly added explanatory power. Weight was at least as good as other more complex measures, including the fat index proposed by Frisch. Low SES was associated with later age at menarche and appears to act through slower growth. Whenever weight was included in an analysis, the SES effects were not significant. Finally, although low SES tends to delay menarche, it seems to have little effect on the interval of adolescent subfecundity. Indeed, late maturers exhibit some degree of "catching up" in that the length of the subfecundity interval is negatively related to age at menarche.
The study also has a methodological focus. We demonstrate that use of hazard models permits more detailed and penetrating findings to be extracted from the kinds of retrospective data traditionally collected as well as from longitudinal data of the types only recently available. In particular, multivariate analysis of age at menarche and the subfecundity interval, and their relations to anthropometric time-varying covariates as well as socioeconomic indicators, is shown to be feasible and informative.

a short summary of its merits and application (for more detailed treatments, see Trussell and Hammerslough, 1982; Tuma et al., 1979; Tuma and Hannan, 1984; Allison, 1982; and Menken et al., 1981).
HAZARD MODELS
There are many structurally similar empirical questions which focus on determining how the time spent between two successive events varies in relation to certain explanatory variables. For example, in studying reproductive development one normally speaks of a sequence of events that occur to a girl, usually after the age of ten (e.g., breast buds appear, menstruation begins, first pregnancy occurs). A major question is how factors such as socioeconomic status and nutrition (as measured anthropometrically) help explain the time between various pairs of events.
Many analyses have treated the reported duration between two events as a dependent variable and explored the relationships to a set of explanatory variables using multiple regression techniques. (For example, the marriage to pregnancy interval might be regressed on age and occupational status of the women.) There are, however, two basic problems associated with this approach: It does not adequately handle either time-varying covariates or censored data (Allison, 1982).
The regression approach assumes the explanatory variables are constant throughout the interval in question. Consider, however, a women who at marriage is a student and then is employed for a few years before beginning a pregnancy. Such a woman cannot be assigned to a single occupational category of "student" or "employee." The

problem might be solved by creating categories for women who change occupational status during the interval. However, if the patterns of change are overly complex, the model can become un-*k wieldy. Occupation, in this situation, is best handled as a time-varying covariate, one that may change during the period between the occurrence of the two events under investigation.
The second problem, censoring, is even more difficult. Censored individuals are those for whom one does not have ending times either because the study was concluded before they experienced the second event or because they were unavailable for a follow-up visit (having migrated, died, or refused to continue in the study). Consider, for example, a woman who married at age 20 and was still childless when later interviewed at the age of 23. When duration between marriage and first birth is the dependent variable, if she is either assigned a duration of three years or excluded from the sample entirely, the average marriage-birth interval will be underestimated, and serious errors in estimation and interpretation may result.
Censored data and time-varying covariates can be dealt with through the use of multivariate hazard models which take as their dependent variables the rates at which people move from one state to another (e.g., from nonpregnant to pregnant) rather than the durtS^ tions spent in each state. In the example given above, the statistics of interest would be the marital first pregnancy rates at each duration since marriage.
Women contribute one observation for each month from marriage (or start of observation) until they become pregnant or are censored. Each observation consists of a binary dependent variable

(whether or not conception occurred in that month)and a set of covariates or explanatory variables for that month (one of which is the duration since marriage). The covariates may be continuous (e.g., " a g e at marriage) or categorical (e.g., religion), constant over the interval (e.g., educational status), or time-varying (e.g., occupational status). Consider a woman who was a student at marriage and remained a student forfive months, but then was employed for ten months, at which time she became pregnant. She would contribute fifteen observations, the first five with occupational status of student and the next ten with the status of employee. The dependent pregnancy variable would be zero for the first fourteen observations and one for the fifteenth. Another woman with exactly the same characteristics except that she was seen for fifteen months but did not become pregnant would have exactly the same set of fifteen observations except that the last pregnancy variable would also be zero. Under this scheme, all available information on all the women can be analyzed.
Consider women with a particular set of characteristics or values of the explanatory variables,

While the logistic equation is theoretically different from the log-linear equation mentioned above, in pratice the estimated coefficients are similar so long as the hazard of interest, in this case the monthly first pregnancy rate, is relatively small (Allison, 1982)1. There are

x = {xux2,. . .xk}.
Their hazard rate is defined as the number of conceptions per number of J^tvomen who had not previously conceived. Two models are most commonly proposed for the hazard rate: log-linear and logistic. In the first, the log of the hazard rate is a linear function of the covariates. For example, if the covariates, the *'s, are marriage duration,occupational status, and age, the loglinear model for the first pregnancy rate could be:

'The 15 separate monthly observations are incorporated into the model under the assumption that they are independent. This assumption is valid when the model being estimated completely describes the underlying hazard. If the logistic hazard function is fitted and the resulting equation,

in fact represents the underlying process, then the observations will indeed be independent. However, in most cases a more accurate description of the hazards would include an error term:

Since the ""s are not likely to be independent for a given individual over time, the assumption of in-

computational advantages in using the logistic formulation when it is desirable to include continuous covariates in the model.
In either case, the coefficients, the b's, are measures of the impact of the particular covariates on the hazard rate (or its log or logit). Models of this type can be evaluated using several readily available package programs (e.g., LOGLIN, RATE, SAS). We have found the logistic procedure in SAS to be the easiest to use when continuous or time-varying covariates are appropriate for a particular situation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data used in this study were recorded in 14 villages in Matlab Thana, Bangladesh, during the period between March, 1976, and February, 1977. Initially, all girls aged 10 to 20 were interviewed, and information on menstrual and pregnancy history, as well as socioeconomic status, was collected. Chowdhury et al. (1977) summarized these retrospective data. Anthropometric measures and information on menstrual status were then collected on a monthly basis for the next year. In all, 1,618 women were included in at least part of the study.
A month-long observation interval is thought to be appropriate both because the female reproductive system is itself monthly and because the interval is short enough to be sensitive to seasonal variations in weight and height that are presumed to have some impact on the

maturation process. The covariates used in our models are presented in Table 1.
THE MENARCHE MODELS
A data set designed to measure the menarche rate (i.e., the rate at which girls move from the premenarcheal to the postmenarcheal state) would optimally include data on each individual from an early age (i.e., before the earli* est menarche in the sample, say, exact age 10) until the time of menarche. In the analysis of such a data set, a girl who reached menarche at age 15 and 6 months would contribute 66 months of exposure to a hazard model. Data for the dependent variable, whether or not menarche occurred that month, would be available for each of the 66 months. Unfortunately no study we know of provides comparable information each month on anthropometric measures in any population, let alone in a natural fertility population which has experienced varying degrees of protein-calorie undernutrition. The Matlab Menarche Study includes one year of longitudinal information, so anthropometric data are available for a fraction of the exposure period of each girl who was premenarcheal at the start of the study period.
Because we are using hazard models, however, the limited time span of measurement does not constitute a major handicap. Reasonable estimates of the menarche rate can be obtained by l e t ^ ting each eligible girl contribute a maximum of 12observations (from her age in months at the start of the study until her age at menarche or censoring at the end of the year). The numbers of observations and events (menarches) tabulated on this basis and grouped by year of age appear in Table 2. As expected, the annual hazard, calculated as events/

A rudimentary understanding of maximum likelihood estimation is necessary in order to interpret the models with covariates presented in Table 3. The hazard (A.)is related to a number of covariates {x\, x-i, . . . x£), as shown in Equation (1) or Equation (2). The estimation procedure involves finding the parameters (the b's) which maximize the "likelihood" function, where the likelihood is defined as the probability of observing what was in fact observed, assuming that a particular set of estimates of the b's actually are the true b's. This notion of likelihood may best be understood by an example.

On the other hand, if she did not experience a first menstruation during the given month, she did so with probability 1--Xu- In this way the probability of observing the event (menstruation or no menstruation) which actually occurred can be calculated for each month of observation of each girl. The likelihood will be the product of all these probabilities for each month and for each girl. Note that each different set of b's will generate a different likelihood. The point behind maximum likelihood estimation is to find a set of parameter estimates, b's, such that the likelihood is maximized. Conventionally, the maxi-

the likelihood statistic for the model containing Xj as a covariate (call it Ai) is compared to that for the model which does not contain jcy (A2). Asymptotically, the difference A2-Ai has a chisquare distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the difference in the number of parameters estimated in the two models. This difference will be one in the case of a continuous variable, n-1 in the case of a categorical variable with n categories. A continuous variable, then, will be significant if the difference in the likelihood statistics is greater than 3.84 (x2.95 with ld.f.).
Since maximum likelihood estimation requires iterative computational ^procedures, model selection can be expensive if separate models must be fit to test the significance of each covariate. Fortunately, rough estimates of the changes in the likelihood statistic when one covariate is dropped can be estimated without iteration (Harrell, 1980), thus providing a way to test which covariates appear essential.
In the first model in Table 3, only the

constant was included. The logistic model (Equation 2) was estimated because some of the covariates of interest can best be described as continuous. Estimates of change in the likelihood statistic if a particular variable were to be added to the constant appear in the column labeled "Change." Remember that we are looking for the smallest value of the chi-square statistic. When a variable is not included in the model, and we are considering the increase in explanatory power that would result from including it, the change is negative; it is thus an estimate of how much the likelihood statistic will decrease as a result of including that variable in a new model. Since all variables are continuous, any change with absolute value above 3.84 is statistically significant. For example, the "change" value for weight (WT) in Model I is -240.6 and, obviously, significant. Therefore, we estimate that the likelihood statistic would decrease from 715.8 (the actual value for Model 1) to 475.2 if weight were included in the model. As can be seen in Model II, the

190

Foster etal.

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:41 08 December 2015

actual likelihood statistic with WT included is 482.5.
On the other hand, when a variable is included in the model, the change statistic estimates the decrease in the explanatory power and thus the increase in the likelihood statistic that will result from the removal of that one variable. The estimate for WT in Model II, for example, suggests that the likelihood statistic will increase by 130.1 if WT is removed from the model. Thus, the likelihood statistic for Model I should be 612.6, which is not particularly close to its actual value of 715.8. The difference results from the estimate of change being based on the assumption that the other coefficients in Model II (in this case only the constant) will remain the same after WT is removed. However, the constants are quite different in Models I and II. This situation underscores the nature of the change statistic as an estimate. Especially large differences between the estimated and actual changes in the likelihood statistic may result when several variables already included in the model are highly correlated. Nonetheless, this procedure can be valuable because it is an inexpensive way of selecting preferred models.
In Model II we find that only the addition of age will add significant explanatory power to a model including weight. Model HI shows the resulting coefficients. Notice that both coefficients, as expected, are positive; menarche rates increase with age or weight.
There are several substantive results that emerge from Table 3. First, as indicated by the high change values in Model I, virtually all the anthropometric indices and measures would provide significant extra explanatory power when compared to the model with a constant only. However, when the best indi-

cator, weight, was included, only age remained significant. It is clear that the anthropometric indices typically used in menarche analyses are highly correlated. Indeed, among premenarcheal women (weighted by the number of months of exposure contributed to the model), the correlation between weight and height is 0.922 and between weight and the inverse fat index is -0.710.
Second, these findings shed new light on Frisch's controversial critical body fat hypothesis (Frisch et al., 1971,1973). That weight is a better predictor of menarche than the fat index as well as the scaled indices of weight-for-height does not disprove Frisch's hypothesis, but does indicate that the fat index used by Frisch is less useful a predicator of menarche than less complicated indices, especially weight.
Finally, there is no evidence for a critical weight at menarche which is invariant by age. Age, as indicated by Model III, adds significant explanatory power to the model. In order to understand the magnitude of this effect, some explanation is necessary. The coefficient of a continuous variable Xk is nearly equal to the relative risk of reaching menarche in a given month for a woman whose value on that variable is Xk + 1 in comparison to one whose value is Xk (assuming the two have exactly the same values on all other explanatory variables in the model). To demonstrate this statement with regard to the variable age, consider the relative odds ratio (ROR), denned as:
ROR=.
where \i is the probability that the older girl (who is age x + 1 years) will reach menarche in a given month and X2 the

probability that the younger girl (age x years) will do so. The logistic hazard function in Model II indicates that:
= -18.3 + 0.198 AGE + 0.353 WT.
Therefore the log of the relative odds ratio
£n{ROR)
= (-18.3+ 0.198 (AGE + 1) + 0.353 WT)-(-18.3
+ 0.198AGE +0.353 WT) = 0.198,
so that the coefficient of age is the log of the relative odds ratio when weight is increased by 1. The relative risk is \]/X2, but as long as X!and X2 are fairly small, the relative risk is approximately equal to the relative odds ratio, and so the relative risk is approximately exp (0.198) = 1.22. A given premenarcheal girl, then, is about 1.22 times as likely to reach menarche in a given month as a girl of the same weight who is a year younger. Menarche rates thus vary with age even after accounting for changes in weight. Similar results were obtained when the fat index and age were included in the model (not shown).
Socioeconomic status variables were included in another set of models to identify those variables which are reflated to the menarche rate. (Age is included as the usual surrogate measure of level of maturity.) The results of Model I (constant only) show that adding age next would produce the greatest decline in the likelihood statistic. They also indicate (and are borne out by the other models) that, contrary to results of other studies (for example, Billewicz et al., 1981; Stukovsky et al., 1967), family

size, here measured by number of living siblings, is not significantly related to the menarche rate. This finding may in part be due to the fact that families of higher socioeconomic status in Bangladesh tend to be larger (Table 4).
Successive models were then selected by adding one variable at a time (the one with the largest decline estimate) until, with the variables included in Model II, the addition of any of the remaining variables produced no significant estimated change. It should be noted that it is possible to have significant change in the likelihood statistic if a set of variables is added to the model, even if no one variable in the set is significant. Model III is included to test for this possibility. The difference in the likelihood statistics is not significant, so that the variables not included in Model II, either alone or in combination, do not add significantly to the explanation of the menarche rate. Thus, the socioeconomic effects appear to be captured by the variables representing religion, house size, and ownership of a lep (quilt). Moslems, who contribute 70 per cent of the womenmonths of exposure in this analysis, are relatively well off compared to the Hindus. House size and lep ownership are also positive indicators of socioeconomic status. The positive coefficients suggest, as expected, that girls from families with more favorable socioeconomic status experience earlier menarche.
In addition it was found that SES seems to exert its effect on menarche primarily through affecting growth. The socioeconomic variables were no longer significant once weight was added to Model II, as shown in Model IV. Age retained significance, as in Table 3, Model III. Comparing the likelihood statistic for Model IV to that for weight

DETERMINANTS OF
ADOLESCENT SUBFECUNDITY
Despite the rather extensive attention paid to the question of the determinants of menarche, very few studies have considered the period of adolescent subfecundity. This difference cannot be attributed to the fact that menarche is a more interesting subject; rather, it results from the major problems associated with estimating the level of fecundity at any particular time. Menarche is a directly observable event, but fecundity can only be observed indirectly

through detection of a pregnancy.4 Nonetheless, several scholars have tried to estimate the period of subfecundity.
Perhaps the most complete analysis of the subject is by Montagu (1979). In a review of the literature from a number of disciplines, Montagu makes a strong case for the existence of a period of subfecundity that typically lasts about two years following menarche. He reports results of a large survey of Indian women (Talwar, 1965) which shows a clear pattern of pregnancy rates rising
4Of course, there are medical techniques that can be used to get a more direct indicator of fecundity such as the presence of regular ovulatory cycles. However, these techniques are generally too difficult or expensive to administer on a wide scale.

with age among married teenagers.5 Talwar concluded that "some degree of adolescent sterility . . . extends up to age 19." Unfortunately, ages at menar. che were not reported, so the extent to W which periods of infertility or subfecundity among married teenagers are related to age at menarche cannot be determined. This problem is commonplace.
Even when information on menarche is available, the period of subfecundity has proved difficult to measure because of problems in taking the menarchemarriage interval into account. For example, if a woman reaches menarche at 13, is married at 20, and has a first child at 21, it is clearly unreasonable to say that the period of subfecundity was 8 years. Montagu, in analyzing an unpublished study from China, concluded that the only accurate way of measuring the period of subfecundity was to look at the menarche-conception intervals only among those women who were married before menarche. Unfortunately the resulting sample size was very small.
As was mentioned above, the hazard model provides a relatively straightforward solution of the problem by examining the rate at which women experience a first pregnancy. Defining the dependent variable in this way is useful for a number of reasons: First, in establishing a first pregnancy rate, only women who are currently married enter 4k the analysis at each duration since menarche. A woman who is not married until her seventh year following menarche would not contribute exposures and events until her seventh gynecological

year (i.e., seventh year since menarche). The rates thus generated can then be used to estimate the typical marriageconception interval for a woman who is married before menarche. Second, the hazard model can be used to test the effects of covariates on the first pregnancy rate using a multivariate model.
Since only a few girls experienced both menarche and a first pregnancy during the course of the year-long prospective survey, it proved necessary to rely on the retrospective data on menarche and pregnancy (collected during the first interview) for the calculation of first-pregnancy rates. Unfortunately, the use of the retrospective sample precludes consideration of anthropometric variables. In addition, errors in reporting are likely to be much greater in the restrospective data. The data are also limited to pregnancies resulting in a live birth, since the reporting of early fetal losses in young girls, who normally have regular menses, seems especially problematic. Fortunately, one component of fecundity is the ability to give birth successfully.
Table 5 shows first live-birth (LB) conception rates by gynecological age, where conception was assumed to occur exactly nine months before the birth. As expected under the hypothesis of a period of subfecundity following menarche, the first LB conception rates increase, with the exception of the second year, from 0.027 in the year following menarche to 0.185 six years later. The lifetable median menarche-conception interval for a woman married before menarche is 1.5 years.6
Some interesting conclusions can be drawn from Model II of Table 6. First,

the variable MOSLEM, the most significant socioeconomic indicator in the menarche rate analysis is not significant in the subfecundity analysis. Unfortunately, the available data could not be used to test other socioeconomic variables because a sizeable proportion of the married women in the sample had migrated into the Matlab registration area for marriage. For a woman of this type, no information was available regarding the SES of her family of origin (e.g., education of parents, siblings, house size).
Second, age at menarche has a significant and positive relation with fecundity, suggesting that girls with relatively late menarche will have a shorter period of subfecundity. This analysis helps answer a question that has been raised in a number of articles, but has been studied only rarely and inconclusively.7 The evi-
7Montagu (1979), working with an unpublished survey, tentatively reported a shorter period of subfecundity among late maturers. Similar conclusions have been drawn with respect to other animals (Mills and Ogle, 1936; Dickerson, 1964). On the other hand, Halewijn and de Waard (1968) reported that Dutch South African girls reach menarche earlier than do their Bantu counterparts and

dence here suggests that late maturers tend to catch up in terms of fecundity. Assuming that the hazard is linear in duration since menarche (a question that will be taken up shortly), wefindthe implicit median subfecundity interval may be calculated from the estimated equation (Model II). For girls with ages at menarche of 15.7 and 16.7, the intervals are 17 and 14 months respectively. A one-year increase in age at menarche might then lead to only a 9-month increase in the age at which a woman becomes capable of giving birth.
We next checked the accuracy of the assumption of a linear change in the first LB conception rate by duration since menarche. In order to test this assumption, we compared Models II and III, where III includes categorical variables for each year since menarche (SMi) along with the linear SINCEMEN term. The difference between the likelihood

Under the null hypothesis that these types of heterogeneity are biasing the results, first live birth conception rates would be positively related to the menarche-marriage interval. Comparing Models II and IV, we can reject the null hypothesis since the difference in likelihood statistics is only 1.5, compared with A"2.95,3 = 7.81.

Nonetheless, some conclusions can be drawn. First, the period of subfecundity seems to remain largely unaffected by adverse conditions, at least those measured by standard anthropometric indexes. Religion, which is a good predictor of the menarche rate, does not help to explain the subfecundity interval. A second and more important result is that the periods of subfecundity are significantly shorter for those with later men-

With regard to menarche, weight is a better predictor than other measures tested, but age has an independent effect on the menarche rate.
