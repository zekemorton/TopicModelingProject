ABSTRACT: The relationship between inbreeding and certain reproductive parameters was studied by analyzing the reproductive history questionnaires collected from 194 women who attended a research clinic in the Mennonite community of Goessel, Kansas, and for whom pedigrees were constructed from data at the Mennonite Historical Library and at the Alexanderwohl Church. Five reproductive parameters, age of menarche, age of menopause, length of reproductive span, number of children, and fetal wastage, were compared in inbred and noninbred women. There is no consistent evidence that absence of inbreeding or degree of inbreeding (F = 0.00024--0.0332) significantly affects these reproductive parameters in this sample of Mennonite women. If inbreeding does have an effect on these reproductive variables, it is too small to be detected in this sample.

Inbreeding depression in domestic and experimental animals has long been known to result from the mating of biologically related individuals. Falconer (1960) in hisdiscussion of inbreeding depression states that the reduction in mean phenotypic values with inbreeding is greatest for traits that are associated with reproductive fitness. Thus, characters such as litter size or lactation in mammals are more strongly affected than those such as bristle number in Drosophila, which shows little or no change.
The effects of inbreeding in human populations have been a topic of research for many years. Most published studies have been concerned only with the consequences of inbreeding in the fetus, i.e., the offspring of parental consanguinity. But one can also study parental inbreeding by seeing if reproductive parameters of the individual are affected by his or her own degree of inbreeding. In this paper the parameters of age of menarche, age of menopause,

reproductive span, number of living children, and fetal deaths will be examined in relation to degree of inbreeding in women of the Mennonite community of Goessel, Kansas. These data are part of a large multidisciplinary study on aging carried out at the University of Kansas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
MENNONITEPOPULATION
The Mennonite community of Goessel traces its historical origins to the Przechowka Church in West Prussia in 1669. The members kept very good records which documented the population's growth and eventual migration to Russia in 1821. There, the congregation's name was changed to Alexanderwohl in honor of the Czar. Later, in 1874, political and economic conditions in Russia led the population to move to the United States. Once in the United States, the group partitioned into three parts. The group that settled in Goessel

(40 miles north of Wichita) became known as the "New Alexanderwohl" congregation. The Alexanderwohl Church underwent fissioning in 1909 and 1920, when two daughter congregations formed. This study focuses on the New Alexanderwohl Church and its daughter congregations--the Goessel Mennonite Church and the Tabor Mennonite Church. All of these congregations are members of the General Conference of Mennonite Churches. More details of Alexanderwohl history can be found in Crawford and Rogers (1982).
The Goessel community is a stable, homogeneous population living in a relatively low-stress environment. Members of this population share a common religion, history, and form of subsistence, farming. Thus, the rich historical record and homogeneous socioeconomic conditions make Goessel an ideal population in which to compare reproductive parameters in inbred and noninbred women of the same community.
METHODS
Adult members of the Mennonite community of Goessel were invited to participate in a multidisciplinary study on aging in January, 1980. The research team which included anthropologists, sociologists, psychologists, physiologists, and medical doctors established a research clinic to provide a meeting place where the data could be collected. Five hundred and seventy (570) individuals participated in the Goessel research clinic. This number represents 51 per cent of the adult resident membership of Alexanderwohl, Tabor, and Goessel churches. The participants consisted of 258 males and 312 females.
Women attending the clinic were asked to fill out a reproductive history questionnaire. The questionnaire ob-

tained information on age of menarche and menopause, number of living children, pregnancies and fetal wastage (miscarriages and stillborns), and if the individual had undergone hormone treatment, used the pill, or undergone surgery affecting reproductive organs.
Pedigree data were collected at the Mennonite Historical Library in North Newton, Kansas, and at the Alexanderwohl Church in Goessel by Laurine Rogers, formerly of the Department of Anthropology, University of Kansas. Of the pedigrees collected, 62.5 per cent were five generations or more and 37.5 per cent were four generations or less. Inbreeding coefficients were calculated according to the method of Wright (1922) by Dr. Rogers.
Reproductive variables of the inbred and noninbred women were compared using Student's t test. For analyses of menopause and length of reproductive span, all women who had surgery (oophorectomy or hysterectomy) or who had used the pill or had undergone hormone treatment were excluded from the analysis. Women using other forms of birth control were not excluded. Comparisons of numbers of children and fetal wastage (miscarriages and stillborns) used data from women who had completed their families. Women who had experienced natural or surgical menopause formed this group.
Further analyses included regressing the reproductive parameters on F (inbreeding coefficient) and a Pearson's correlation matrix of the parameters. Because there was such a wide range in the degrees of inbreeding among the women, the inbred group was divided into three levels of inbreeding. The levels were determined by the F value that is equivalent to the "n" values of the inbreeding coefficient formula, F = 4 x

V2" (Wright, 1922). The reproductive variables in each inbreeding level were analyzed by Student's ttest to determine if degree of inbreeding had effects on the parameters.
Both age at menarche and ageof menopause constitute recall data. The inaccuracy of retrospective data is well documented (Damon et al., 1969). However, in order to examine the effects of parental inbreeding, one must know age of menarche and menopause in the same woman. Except for afew studies like Treloar's (1974) largeprospective study in Minnesota, longitudinal data arenot used. Therefore, most status quo studies collect menarcheal data from school girls and menopausal data from anolder female group. Inthis study, one has to use recall data so that age at menarche andage of menopause are obtained from the same woman.

less, instead of more, fetal loss. However, this difference was not significant according to the t test.
To examine further the effects of inbreeding on reproductive factors, we performed regressions of age at menarche, age at menopause, reproductive span, number of children, and fetal wastage on F coefficients > 0. Neither menarche, menopause, reproductive span, nor fetal loss was significantly affected by the degree of inbreeding. However a significant regression coefficient of 0.37 (p < 0.02) was obtained when number of children was regressed with F. In other words, women with a higher degree of inbreeding had more children. This of course is the opposite of the prediction of the working hypothesis that inbreeding will depress reproductive fitness.
Pearson's correlation coefficients, shown in Table 2, essentially confirm the results of the regression analyses. There is no significant correlation between F coefficient and menarche, menopause, and fetal wastage; and there is a positive correlation with number of children. Reproductive span is also significantly correlated with F. Again, this is not expected with the working hypothesis that inbred women have shorter reproductive spans.

In an attempt to elucidate why inbred women have more children, the data were examined to see if age were correlated with F by regressing number of children with age. This could demonstrate a possible volitional shift to a smaller family size in younger women and a possible lower degree of inbreeding in younger women. Neither statistic was significant; neither family size nor F has a relationship to age in this sample.
Since there is such a large difference in degrees of inbreeding among the women (0.00024--0.0332), the F coefficients were divided into three groups: Group 1 is the least inbred with F< 0.0039; Group 2 is the intermediate level with F values = 0.0040--0.0156; and Group 3 is the most highly inbred with F> 0.0156. Student's t tests were used to compare each inbred group by pairs in order to see if the level of inbreeding was affecting age of menarche, age of menopause, length of reproductive span, number of children and fetal loss. Figure 1 shows the comparison of the three levels of inbreeding and reproductive parameters. The n's vary in each parameter category for the same reasons given earlier. There is one less individual in the high Fgroup and reproductive span because one woman did not report age of menarche. The women in the three inbred groups whose data are analyzed in the children and fetal wastage categories are women who had experienced natural or surgical menopause. No significant differences were seen comparing menarche, menopause, span, number of children, and fetal wastage. Though not statistically significant, the high inbred group surprisingly had an earlier menarche, later menopause, longer reproductive span, and more children per woman than the low inbred group. These results are the

opposite expected bythe inbreedingdepression hypothesis. Only with a higher fetal wastage did the high inbred group meet the expectation of thehypothesis. However, asstated above, none ofthese differences isstatistically significant.

If inbreeding has the same deleterious effects on reproductive performance in humans as it does in manyanimal species, it would be reasonable to

expect the inbred women would have later menarches, earlier menopauses, shorter reproductive spans, fewer children, and more fetal wastage. The results of this study do not support this hypothesis. Except for two positive correlations of children and reproductive spans with inbreeding coefficient, there appears to be no difference between inbred and noninbred women. Compared to animal studies, this analysis is limited by the small sample size and by the low F coefficients in general. Inbreeding depression among animals is often studied in full sib matings where the Fof the offspring is 0.25.
A review of the literature has not found any other studies that analyzed the effect of degree of inbreeding on age of menarche, age of menopause, and length of reproductive span. However there have been many studies investigating inbreeding and human fertility. None of the largest and best designed studies has demonstrated a consistent significant effect of parental consanguinity on the frequency of deaths (Schull, 1958, 1959; Schull and Neel, 1965; Schull et al., 1970a; Schull et al., 19706; Schull and Neel, 1972; Hook and Schull, 1973; Rao and Inbaraj, 1977). These references are studies of Schull, Neel, and their colleagues in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and later in Hirado, Japan, and the investigations of Rao and Inbaraj in Tamil Nadu, South India. In relation to the positive correlation between F and number of children found in this paper, it is noteworthy that the parental inbreeding portion of the Hirado study showed that inbred wives had significantly more pregnancies and livebirths than noninbred wives (Schull et al., 1970a). In Schull's study, the inbreeding coefficients of the inbred sam-

ple ranged from second cousins to first cousins (F = 0.0156 to 0.06). The Mennonite women were not as highly inbred; only 15 of the sample had F values in the range of 0.015 to 0.06 and of those none had a F value higher than 0.0332.
Aside from Schull's and his colleagues' study in Hirado, there are only two other reports dealing with parental inbreeding. Warburton and Fraser (1964) in their analysis of reproductive histories of women at Montreal Children's Hospital found no difference between abortion frequency among wives of inbred and noninbred husbands. In another study, Tanaka et al. (1967) found a significant increase in sterility among inbred wives, but no effect in inbred husbands living in Hoshino and Kurogi, Japan.
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, there is no consistent evidence that inbreeding significantly affects the reproductive parameters of age of menarche, age of menopause, length of reproductive span, number of children, and fetal loss in this sample of Mennonite women. The next step in the analysis of this sample is to establish which of the husbands of these women are inbred and to obtain their F coefficients. In view of previous studies, however, the conclusions outlined in this paper will probably stay the same: if inbreeding does have an effect on these reproductive parameters, it is too small to be detected in this sample.
