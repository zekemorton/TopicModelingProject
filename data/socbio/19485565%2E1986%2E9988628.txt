ABSTRACT: U.S. vital registration data on live births and data on abortions and ectopic pregnancies from a national hospital discharge survey were used to examine the seasonality of conceptions and the influence the conception pattern has on the monthly incidence of abortions and ectopic pregnancies. We found that in the United States conceptions follow a consistent seasonal pattern with the peak in November and December. However, when the pattern for conceptions is controlled, the monthly variation for abortions and ectopic pregnancies is not significant. Therefore, we find no monthly excess for any of these outcomes of pregnancy over that expected as a consequence of the seasonality of conception. We suggest the monthly variation for the number of each of these pregnancy outcomes will best be explained when the seasonal variation in conceptions is understood.

Several studies have suggested that in the United States conceptions have a seasonal pattern with the major peak in November and December (Kaplan, 1973; Cohen and Bracken, 1977; Warren, 1978; Warren et al., 1980; Seiver, 1985). Most of these studies make this point after analyzing the seasonality of live births (Warren, 1978;Seiver, 1985), live births and spontaneous abortions (Kaplan, 1973; Warren et al., 1980), or live births and induced abortions (Cohen and Bracken, 1977). From these studies there is little question that conceptions follow a seasonal pattern; however, there is much debate as to the effect the conception pattern has on the individual seasonal patterns for various pregnancy outcomes.
Kaplan (1973) and McDonald (1971) found an excess of spontaneous abortions in the spring (after controlling for conceptions) and suggested that infective agents that are epidemic in the spring may be the explanation. In con-

trast, Warren et al. (1980) found no monthly excess of spontaneous abortions after controlling for conceptions. He and his colleagues concluded that the monthly number of spontaneous abortions is probably related to the seasonal pattern of conceptions. In their analysis of induced abortion, Cohen and Bracken (1977) came to a conclusion similar to that of Warren et al. (1980).
The purpose of this study is to expand on the findings from these earlier studies by focusing on the question:
If conceptions are seasonal, howdoesthe monthly pattern of conceptions influence the monthly incidence of induced abortions, spontaneous abortions, and/or ectopic pregnancies?
Our study, compared with earlier studies, includes more pregnancy outcomes in the definition of conception (i.e., conceptions = live births + induced abortions + spontaneous abortions + ectopic pregnancies) and a more extensive analysis of the influence

We used this estimate of the monthly number of conceptions in two ways: (1) to describe the seasonal pattern of conceptions, and (2) as the denominator incalculating the monthlyinduced and spontaneous abortion rates and the ectopic pregnancy rate.

for live births (Figure 1) shows July through October to be the aboveaverage time, with August and September the peak. The trough was from April to May.
Induced abortions also have a twoharmonic seasonal model that accounts for 73 per cent of the monthly variance (Table 3, Panels A and C). The estimated pattern shows the number of induced abortions are above average from January through April with February

and March the peak (Figure 2). This best-fit pattern, as the pattern for live births, is consistent over the nine years studied (Table 3, Panel B).
The seasonal model for unspecified abortions includes four harmonic terms that account for 93 per cent of the monthly variance (Table 3, Panel A and C). This pattern is more irregular than the live birth or induced abortion patterns, as it is above average primarily in February, March, and May, and below

SEASONAL PATTERN OFCONCEPTIONS
The seasonal model of conceptions is a very strong two-harmonic equation that accounts for 97 per cent of the monthly variance (Table 3, Panels A and C). The estimated pattern was consistent over the period 1974-81 (Table 3,

Panel B), with the above average time from October through January (November and December the peak) (Figure 4). The primary below-average times are in March and June through August.

ous abortions nor the ectopic pregnancy rate had significant month effects. This indicates that when the monthly pattern of conceptions is controlled, these rates show no additional monthly trend. The year effect (Table 4, Row 1) was not significant for the rate of spontaneous abortions but was significant for both the rate of induced abortions and ectopic pregnancies. The induced abortion rate decreased, while the ectopic rate rose.

DISCUSSION
We found that the monthly number of conceptions in the United States has a strong and consistent year-to-year seasonal pattern. The above-average time of occurrence is from October through January, with November and December the peak time. This finding is consistent with the results from several earlier studies (Kaplan, 1973; Cohen and Bracken, 1977; Warren, 1978; Warren

et al., 1980; Seiver, 1985). What is new from our study is the finding that certain outcomes of pregnancy, especially induced and spontaneous abortions and ectopic pregnancies, do not have significant monthly variations when the conception pattern is controlled. For all three outcomes of pregnancy, the monthly rate for each event is random across time. That is,the peak and trough times vary from year to year and the degree of amplitude fluctuates over time.

Our results show no support for the idea proposed by McDonald (1971) and Kaplan (1973) that infective agents epidemic in the spring explain the excess of spontaneous abortions during that time. Ourfindingssuggest, therefore, that the monthly variation in induced abortions, spontaneous abortions, and ectopic pregnancies will most likely be explained when the seasonal variation in conceptions is understood.

cause we used a hospital-based data set: (1) The estimated monthly number
of induced abortions is undercounted in the NHDS data. The Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI) estimates that from 1974 to 1982 in the United States the percentage of induced abortions that occurred in hospitals declined from almost 50 per cent to 18 per cent (Henshaw et al., 1984). During the same period, the annual number of induced abortions increased from 899,000 in 1974 to 1,574,000in 1982. Results from the AGI national surveys of abortion providers (i.e., public and private hospitals, freestanding clinics and private physicians) show the number of abortions performed in the United States increased from 1973 to 1980, then remained unchanged from 1981 to 1982. Therefore, the NHDS data undercount the annual total number of induced abortions performed in the U.S. and suggest a trend opposite from that reported using more complete data. Whether the timing of the induced abortions not included in the NHDS differs from those included, and used in our study, is unknown.
(2) The number of spontaneous abortions also are undercounted in the NHDS data. It has been estimated that

14 to 43 per cent (Miller et al., 1980) of all conceptions end in spontaneous abortions that appear as late or extraheavy menstrual periods. These events likely would not result in hospitalization and thus would be excluded from the NHDS data. Again, as with the missing induced abortions,' whether the timing ~ of these spontaneous" aBbrtions differ1" from those reported isuriknown.
(3) The annuaPnumbei'of total abortions included in the NHDS includes a large number that are "not specified" as either induced or spontaneous. The un-* specified category had a significant seasonal pattern that was different from that for induced abortions, spontaneous abortions, or the induced and spontaneous categories combined. Therefore, the unspecified category appears to be mixed. Unfortunately, the extent to which this loss of information affects our analysis of the seasonality of induced and spontaneous abortions is unknown.
(4) The extent to which the number of ectopic pregnancies is undercounted in the NHDS is unknown. The increasing annual trend found for the rate of ectopic pregnancy is consistent with the earlier work by Rubin et al. (1983). They suggested the increase in ectopic

Our findings concerning the monthly number of spontaneous abortions differ from the earlier studies. Kaplan (1973) found a significant excess of spontaneous abortions during March through June. Warren et al. (1980) found a significant seasonal pattern for the number of spontaneous abortions (above average from January through March and July and August), but the monthly rate of spontaneous abortions was not significant. In this study, we found no seasonal pattern for either the number or the rate of spontaneous abortions.

What can we can conclude from our study? In the United States, conceptions follow a consistent seasonal pattern with the peak in November and December. However, when the seasonal pattern for conceptions is controlled, the monthly variation for induced abortions, spontaneous abortions, and ectopic pregnancies is not significant. Therefore, we find no monthly excess for any of these outcomes of pregnancy over that expected as a consequence of the seasonality of conception. The reasons for seasonal variation in the occurrence of conceptions remains to be determined.
