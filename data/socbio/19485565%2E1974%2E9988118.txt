study of factors relating to fertility in an American population that represented a significant segment of white adults. Couples reported their preferences for children of each gender, and these responses were crosstabulated with the actual sex of their children. Since the questions on preferences were asked more than a decade after marriage, they provide an opportunity to study the likely impact of the actual sex of children born on responses to gender preference questions.
In the case of couples with one child, Clare and Kiser (1951, Table 3) note that the gender preference expressed by wives was heavily related to the actual sex of their child. Among mothers with one male child, only 8 per cent said they would have preferred a girl in a single-child family; among mothers of one female child, 69 per cent said they would prefer a girl in a single-child family. When asked to state a gender preference for a two-child family, 50 per cent of mothers with two boys said they preferred two boys; less than 2 per cent of mothers who had borne two girls stated they would rather have had two boys. Additional tabulations by Clare and Kiser (1951) reinforce the conclusion that child gender preferences are conditioned by the actual experiences of husbands and wives. Given the results of the Indianapolis work, it is not surprising that researchers designing later American fertility studies turned to more direct methods to estimate the impact of gender of children on fertility.
The second approach classifies respondents (usually wives) according to their parity at interview and the sex of children already born. For example, at second parity, there are four types of couples, although these are usually grouped into just two types--couples with same-sex children and those with children of different genders. The dependent variables differ according to study design. When a longitudinal or

retrospective design is employed, the parity progression ratios for some period after the birth of the second child are recorded. Differences in parity progression ratios between couples whose children are of the same or of different sex are assumed to measure the effect on fertility of same-sex offspring compared to different-sex offspring.
An alternative dependent variable employed in cross-sectional designs computes intended family size and compares the mean number of children intended, or the percentage of wives who say they intend to have more children, across the sex-ofchild codes. The three following large-scale surveys have reported sex-of-child effects.
Freedman et al., (1960, Table 1) examined responses of a national probability sample of fecund white wives aged 1839, living with their husbands, who were respondents in the 1955 Growth of American Families Study (GAF). Within each current parity group with twOj three, or four children, they classified wives by whether they had children of the same sex or of different sexes. Among wives with two children of the same sex, 63 per cent of the respondents said they expected to have more children, while only 59 per cent of wives with a boy and a girl said they expected to have more children, a difference of 4 per cent. This 4 per cent difference was interpreted to mean that because most couples prefer a child of each sex, those couples hot having this combination at second parity will be more likely to go on to have another child. No data on the actual child-gender preferences prior to the first or second birth are available; therefore, the allocation of the 4 per cent difference to a gender preference is speculative.
The 1957 Princeton Fertility Study (Bumpass and Westoff, 1970) was a probability sample of mothers who delivered a

second child in September, 1956. The sample was drawn from birth records of whites in seven of the eight largest Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas. The third wave of interviewing was completed in 1967, at which time most mothers had completed childbearing. After classifying second-parity mothers by the sex of their first two children, subsequent births were used to calculate parity progression ratios. Among second-parity wives with a boy and a girl, 62 per cent had a third child, compared to 73 per cent of wives with two children of the same sex (Bumpass and Westoff, 1970, p. 94). This 11 percentage point difference is attributed to the difference in the sex of the first two children, with the unmeasured intervening variable, again, being child-gender preferences. Bumpass and Westoff also report that parity progression ratios at higher parities favor the idea that wives in their sample were more likely to have another child if they had children of the same rather than different genders, even at the fourth parity.
Coombs (1973, Table 2) has reanalyzed 1965 National Fertility Study (NFS) data. Among couples with two children, she reports that 70 per cent of those with a boy and a girl said they wanted no more children, while 64 per cent of those with two girls and 61 per cent of those with two boys said they wanted no more children. The latter two figures may suggest a stronger preference for at least one girl than for one boy. Second-parity couples in 1965 with a boy and a girl were about 7 per cent more likely than couples with same-sex children to say they wanted no more children.
Unlike the 1955 GAF and 1957 Princeton Study, 1965 NFS data show no difference in the per cent saying they wanted no more children (80 per cent) among third parity couples, by sex of the first three children. This contrasts sharply with

both earlier reports. It is impossible to test adequately the likely causes of this difference because none of the three studies we have discussed are comparable in sample characteristics or the dependent variable used to measure the sex-of-child effect on actual or intended fertility.
We can say that the evidence from these three studies, in spite of a lack of comparability, points to a small effect of the gender of child among second-parity mothers. This effect is presumed to be caused by gender preferences.
Whether a sex-of-child effect can continue under lower family-size norms than those held by women in 1965 and earlier years is questionable, and we offer some data from a 1971 sample of second-parity wives whose intended family size (2.39) is far below the 3.3 level reported (and later achieved) by second-parity wives in the 1957 Princeton Survey. At issue is the question of whether sex predetermination could make a difference in fertility when family-size norms are lower than they were in the past.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A probability sample of urban white wives aged 18--44 living with their first husband in five North Central states was drawn and interviewed by National Analysts in the summer of 1971. There were 273 wives with just two children in a sample of 1,123 white wives (see Scanzoni, 1974, for additional details).
To assess the probable impact of having two children of the same sex or of different sexes on completed fertility of these mothers, we use two measures. The first is similar to that used by Freedman et al. (1960), that is, the percentage of wives who say they intend to have additional children. The second measure is the mean number of children intended.

Analysis, a form of multiple regression analysis using dummy variables, the characteristics of the sample that are known to be related to intended family size are displayed and put under statistical control (Andrews et al., 1967). Adjusted deviations of categories for each independent variable from the grand mean provides a measure of net impact of each variable.
RESULTS Table 1, column 1, shows the number of wives with given characteristics. Only 26.4 per cent of these 273 second-parity mothers intended to have more than two children, a figure much lower than the 61 per cent of similar wives expecting more children in the 1955 GAF Study (Freedman et al., 1961, Table 1), the 67 per cent

of mothers in the 1957 Princeton Study who went on to have a third birth (Bumpass and Westoff, 1970, Table 37), or the 34 per cent of second-parity mothers in the 1965 NFS study who said they wanted more than two children (Coombs, 1973, Table 2).
Five characteristics that might affect birth intentions are considered: husband's 1970 income; wife's education, religion, giHJ a g e a£ interview; and the sex of the first two children. The relationship of these independent variables to the dependent variable is expressed in terms of deviations around the mean of 26.4 per cent intending to have more children,

tionships among the independent variables and their relationships to the dependent variable are considered. The patterns shown by these gross deviations are familiar. Couples more h'kely than the average to intend to have more children have fewer years of school, are Catholic, and are young. Couples with children of the same sex tend to be only slightly more likely than couples with a boy and a girl to intend to have a third child. When the categories of children of the same sex or of different sexes are combined, the percentage difference is 3.1 per cent.
Column 3 shows the net effects of categories on intended births, controlling all independent variables except wife's age. In general, the pattern of net effects is quite similar to the pattern shown without these statistical controls. However, when wife's age is included (Column 4), the association of husband's 1970 income and wife's education to birth intentions changes, because these characteristics are related to age of the wife. Comparison of the deviations from the mean percentage intending more children among wife's age categories, with and without statistical controls, shows little impact from the introduction of control variables. Also, the bottom row shows that explained variance is more than doubled when wife's age is included. We conclude that wife's age is an important variable, even within the same parity, for controlling variation in birth intentions that might otherwise be incorrectly attributed to education or income.
The use of wife's age as an added control variable does not produce marked changes in the relationship of the sex-ofchild variable to birth intentions. When categories of children of the same sex or of different sexes are combined, the percentage point difference is only 2.7 per cent. This difference is not statistically significant, nor is the zero-order relation-

ship of the sex-of-child measure to birth intentions significant. Still, the direction of this relationship is similar to that reported by previous investigators, and it may be worthwhile to provide a check on the assumption that such percentage differences, using this type of measure, allow the conclusion that completed family size will be larger among couples with children of the same sex rather than different sexes.
The possible impact of sex of children may be better measured by comparing the mean number of children intended than by percentage point differences in the proportion intending to have at least one more child.
Mean intended family size for white wives at the second parity in our 1971 sample was 2.39. Among the 153 wives with a boy and a girl, the mean number intended in 1971 was 2.41; the mean for the 120 wives with children of the same sex was 2.37. Thus, although the measure of the per cent intending additional births suggested a small difference favoring the hypothesis of a sex-of-child effect, this alternative measure finds that wives with a boy and a girl intend on the average to have larger families than do wives with children of the same sex.
Analysis of mean intended family size among wives at the third or higher parities in the 1971 sample yields a similar finding. Among the 222 high-parity wives whose first two children included a boy and a girl, mean intended family size was 4.24; among the 200 high-parity wives whose first two births were both boys or both girls, mean intended family size was 4.19.
These unexpected findings from both second-parity and third-or-higher-parity wives may suggest that less direct indicators of sex-of-child effects on fertility (e.g., the percentage wanting no more, the percentage intending to have more children, or the percentage going on to the

next parity) may yield results that are dissimilar to those obtained from measures of intended or actual completed family size. Presumably, the sex-of-child effect in which demographers are most interested is measured by completed family size.
DISCUSSION In our 1971 sample, neither secondparity nor third-or-higher-parity white wives displayed the expected effect of sex of children on mean intended family size. The 1971 data did not reveal a significant impact of sex of children on birth intentions, with or without statistical controls for sample characteristics that might lead to spurious conclusions. Differences in the strength of effects of gender of children on intentions for additional births among second-or-higherparity mothers between this and earlier studies may be related to family-size norms, even though gender preferences do not change. Of course, if preferences are not strong, then a sex-of-child effect should not emerge, regardless of family-size norms. However, if preferences do exist, their impact on birth plans of second-parity mothers will be more likely to appear if the norms favor three rather, than two children.
Since existing studies on sex-of-child effects among white American couples do not use comparable measures, the conclusion that effects existed in the 1955, 19S7, and 1965 studies, but not in the 1971 survey, is more of a qualified judgment than a verifiable statement. Still, we believe that this may be the case, and we suggest that this difference in sex-of-child effects among the studies is probably a function of changes in the level of intended numbers of children. Between 1955 and 1965, expected family size remained fairly stable and above 3.0 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1972, Table A). The decline in expected family size occurred after 1965. As family-size norms move from around

three to about two children, effects related to actual sex of the first two children may be suppressed. If so, the decline in family-size norms after 1965 may account for the difference between our 1971 results and those from earlier studies.
Had we found a sex-of-child effect of significant size in 1971, it would have implied that future fertility might be reduced if sex predetermination were available, even under current small family norms. Since we did not find an effect in 1971, we conclude that sex predetermination, were it now available, would probably have little impact on the fertility of white wives in the United States.
The demographic effect of sex predetermination technology is not likely to equal the size of a sex-of-child effect, if it exists. Had we an adequate measure (which we do not) of this effect on the completed fertility of birth cohorts, the ability of predetermination techniques to lower fertility by that amount would require that 100 per cent of the population have access to, and make 100 per cent effective use of, the predetermination method. Such levels of access and use effectiveness are unlikely, suggesting that the impact of a new innovation in medical technology to allow sex predetermination would affect only some fraction of those births stemming from a sex-of-child effect. Under small family-size norms, the future impact of sex predetermination on the completed fertility of white wives in the United States appears negligible, barring an unforeseen large shift in the strength of preferences for children of one or the other gender.
