On the basis of her classic study of the Jamaican family structure, Blake (19SS) declared that the fertility of the island would be significantly higher than it is now--probably over 30% higher--if all lower-class Jamaican sexual unions were relatively stable. This viewpoint was also supported by another study by Stycos and Back (1964). The main rationale behind this observation is that the multiple unions which are common among lower-class families of the Caribbean islands give rise to considerable periods of time when the woman is not sexually active and hence not likely to become pregnant.
In the Caribbean in general, and more specifically in the English-speaking islands, there is a substantial amount of movement from one sex partner to another and also a very high percentage of reproduction outside of legal unions. Roberts and Braithwaite (1962, p. 218) observed that "a woman may within the period during which she is involved in a particular type of union be associated successively with several different partners." Goode (1960) concluded that there is little moral, social, and legal stigma attached to this pattern of union formation and reproduction.
Change of partners, however, is not a

form of promiscuous sexual relationship in the Caribbean. A woman is usually associated with only one partner during a specified period of time; and since the change of partners is generally initiated by the male, the woman is without a sexual partner for the length of time it takes her to begin a new relationship. This is the reason why Roberts and Braithwaite (1962, p. 234) argue that the "number of partners with whom a woman has been associated in the course of her reproductive life must weigh heavily in determining relative indices of stability." Blake's study (1955; see also Blake, 1961), as we have stated earlier, argues that the instability caused by the change of partners reduces the number of pregnancies a woman may be expected to have because of the time lapse between partners when the woman is not sexually active.
Another point of view suggests that multiple unions may nonetheless encourage high fertility levels. Stycos and Back (1964) suggest that there is a tendency for children to be desired in each union. Blake (1955, p. 31) suggests two rationales for a possible association between multiple unions and high fertility. First, women believe that children in themselves add more stability

to a union than is achieved by the merely companionate relationship; and second, women want these additional children because the men want them and if they (the women) do not comply, the men will go elsewhere. However, she argues that in actual fact the desire to have children in each new union may not tend to increase fertility, because the Jamaican lower class women do not use contraceptives and hence the desire to have or not to have children is not a determinant of fertility once the woman is in a sexual union.
The present study which is based on interviews of 461 women of reproductive ages of the lower socioeconomic class in Barbados consists of a different type of sample from that of Blake. As has been discussed elsewhere (Ebanks, 1968, 1969, 1970), most of the women in the present sample have at one time or another used contraceptives. The desire for children of the women in this sample could thus possibly be crucial in determining their fertility.
This study is an attempt to evaluate the role of instability of unions in the fertility behavior of the Barbadian women in the present sample. The number of partners with whom a woman has been associated in her life has been used as an index of instability of the union. The rationale behind this is that the higher the number of partners the higher the instability of unions.
THE SAMPLE
For the present study, the data were obtained from a sample of 461 Barbadian women of lower socioeconomic status. These women form a small subgroup of the cases interviewed by the Population Council Research Project (PCRP) which was in operation between May, 1965, and December, 1967. This project was launched by the Bio-medical Division of the Population Council of New York in order to study the relationship between cervical cancer and intrauterine contraceptive devices.

A systematic sample of 500 women who were visiting the family planning clinics at regular intervals for checkups was drawn. A backup sample of another 100 clients was also drawn. This was done by using an electronic computer with the aim that these two samples would yield 500 completed questionnaires equally divided between IUD users and nonusers. Only 461 are included in this study because of failure to locate and interview the other sample units. The cases were interviewed either at the clinic or at home by trained interviewers.
The survey also was intended as a reliability-validity check on the data obtained by the records of the PCRP. Of the women in our sample, 406 had used one or more methods of contraceptive. The fertility history as well as many other socioeconomic data were obtained for each woman using an interviewer-applied questionnaire.
DATA
In our sample, 24.30% of all women had been associated with one sex partner, 29.50% with two partners, 22.99% with three, 14.10% with four, and the remaining 9.11% with five or more partners. On the average, a woman was observed to have sexual relations with 2.6 partners (s = 1.35).
Changes in union status frequently occur without a change of partner. The typical pattern is one of a "visiting" sexual relationship becoming a common-law union and eventually leading to marriage with the same partner, thus yielding three union types but only one partner. Numerous other patterns exist, however, involving more than one partner. We hypothesize that there is a relationship between type of union and number of partners. I t is clear from Table 1 that nearly 65% of the married women had sexual relations with two partners or less. The percentages for common-law and visiting unions are 49.6% and 40.4%, respectively. We observe that the mean number

of sex partners is the least for married women, while it is the highest for women in "visiting" relationships. We find a very significant association between the current union and the number of sex partners.
Although it seems somewhat misleading to predict the number of partners on the basis of current union status which itself

has passed through other types of union, the above observation does indicate that the increase in the number of partners is not a function of increasing age; otherwise the women in married unions, who are generally older, should have had a greater number of partners. Table 2 also supports this observation. The average number of sex partners

seems to be increasing slightly up to the age group 30-34 and then declines. The trend is therefore not a linearly increasing one. The inverse association between age and the number of partners does not seem to be significant. One might argue that older women did not recall and report the number of partners as accurately as did the younger women.
We have discussed earlier that women may desire to bear children in each new union in order to make the union more stable (Blake, 1955, 1961; Stycos and Back, 1964). It is evident from Table 3

of women who had only one sex partner. At the time of the last pregnancy, we find that there were only 26.41% of the women who had had sexual relations with just one partner; 28.57% of the women had had sexual relations with two partners; 26.41% with three partners; and 18.61%, with four or more partners. It is clear that the percentage of women with one partner shows a sharp decline with the increase of the number of pregnancies. The percentage of women with two partners increases up to the second pregnancy, but again shows a decline. The percentages of women with

that at the termination of first pregnancy in the case of women who had one or more pregnancies, 74% had been associated with one partner, 14.44% with two partners, 7.78% with three partners, and only 3.78% with four or more partners. At the termination of second pregnancy, we see a sharp change; of the women who had two or more pregnancies, 45.26% had sex relations with one partner, 36% with two partners, 11.68% with three partners, and 7.06% with four or more partners. It can also be seen that as the order of pregnancy increases, there is a decline in the percentage

three and four or more partners show a slow but continuous increasing trend. Overall, we find the average number of sex partners has increased with increasing childbirth.
The age at first sex experience and the number of sex partners show an inverse relationship (Gamma = --0.366). Table 4 shows that among women who had their first sex experience at or below age 16 years, 16.92% had been associated with one partner, 27.07% with two partners, 26.32% with three, 18.04% with four, and 11.65% with five or more partners.

seems somewhat different for the women who had their first sex experience at or beyond 17 years. Among them 34.36% had been associated with one partner, 29.50% with two partners, 22.99% with three, 14.10% with four, and 9.11% with five or more partners. The average number of sex partners for the former group of women was 2.86, while it was 2.21 for the latter group.
We observed that the fertility of women with a fewer number of sex partners was lower than that of women with a greater number of partners. Although we do not see a clear positive association between the number of partners and fertility, when the average number of live births per mother was standardized by using the age distribution of all mothers, we find a slightly increasing trend in fertility with the increase in number of sex partners (see Table 5). Thus, our sample does not seem to support

the hypothesis that fertility is lowered by unstable unions.
The possible under-reporting of live births during the late ages merits our attention. The women in the age group 45-49 years show an appreciably lower fertility than the women in the age group 40-44 years. This may have occurred because older women do not report as accurately the number of children ever born as do the younger women. This is likely due to memory lapse on the part of the older women in accurately revealing their fertility performances (United Nations, 1967, p. 31). However, this does not seem to be the reason why the number of live births per woman should be higher for unstable unions. Actually, one might argue that the women in the unstable unions might be less able to recall all live births and might report their fertility performance more inaccurately than the women who have not

been associated with many partners. If births were reported more accurately, a difference in the fertility performances of women in stable and unstable unions might become more distinct than it is at present,
Some related aspects of the period of exposure to pregnancy have also been studied and may shed some light on this

phenomenon. We can see from Table 6 that the mean age at first sex experience for women with three or more partners is significantly lower than that for women with two partners or less. The inverse relationship between age at entry into union and fertility performance might explain the above phenomenon. That is to say, women

with a fewer number of partners might be experiencing lower fertility because of higher age at first sex experience. One striking feature which is evident from Table 6 is that the mean age at termination of first pregnancy for the women with fewer partners is significantly higher than that for the women with a greater number of partners. It is important to note that the latter group started cohabitation at a relatively early age and terminated the first pregnancy at a relatively higher age. It means that the exposure to pregnancy before the first conception for the women with fewer partners is lower than for the others. This might lead one to suspect the role of instability of unions in discouraging the fertility level before first conception. However, the role of adolescent sterility for women who entered into a union at as early an age as 16 years or below must be taken into account (Fortes, 1954, p. 297-299; Talwar, 1965).
So as to avoid the misunderstanding that earlier age at first sex experience for the women with greater number of partners would have given rise to greater period of exposure to the risk of pregnancy, we calculated the mean length of reproductive life span as well as the mean duration of exposure to pregnancy for both the groups of women. This was done by calculating the mean age at termination of last pregnancy (even though most of the women have not completed their reproductive life span). Although it was found that the mean length of reproductive life span and mean duration

of exposure to pregnancy for the women with three or more partners were greater than the others, the mean interval between pregnancies in a relatively more stable union is similar to that in a relatively less stable union.
SUMMARY
In this study an attempt was made to evaluate the role of unstable unions (measured in terms of the number of sex partners with whom a woman has been associated during her reproductive life) in the fertility performance of a sample of 461 women of the lower socioeconomic class of the island of Barbados. It was observed that there was no appreciable difference between the fertility performance of the women who had sex relations with either a lesser or a greater number of partners. The conventional hypothesis that the considerable periods of nonexposed time to pregnancy caused by multiple unions encourages low fertility was not supported.
In contrast to the conventional hypothesis, the age-adjusted fertility rate tended to increase with the increase in the number of sex partners. Two possible reasons for such an observation are suggested: (1) the women in the unstable unions started sex relations at an early age; and (2) most of the women in the sample had used contraceptives at one time or the other and, therefore, the desire to have children in each new union may have been operative in increasing fertility in unstable unions.
