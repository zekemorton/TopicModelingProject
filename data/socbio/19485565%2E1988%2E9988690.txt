ABSTRACT:This research investigated the degree to which birth order, number of siblings, and other family configuration variables such as parental education and material modernity affect Iranian adolescents' reports pertaining to differential parental power. Reports of parental involvement or indices of such involvement in a number of interaction areas were collected from 732 senior high-school students in Shiraz, Iran. An overall index of comparative parental power was constructed and used as the dependent variable, to be predicted by family configuration variables. Results indicated that both birth order and family size affected reported power. Perceived maternal power increased with birth order and decreased with the number of siblings. These effects remained when pertinent measures of SES, parental education, and modernity were included in the model. It is concluded that some of the effects of birth order and family size on social and psychological development of children are probably mediated by their effects on the intrafamily power structure and communication patterns.

This research explored the effects of family constellation variables (sex, age, birth order, number of siblings), and parental-family variables (education, occupation, and modernity) on Iranian adolescents' perceptions of parental power. Most of the research on parental power has been conducted in the United States, has incorporated a small subset of these variables, and has addressed parental perceptions. A thorough review of findings is beyond the scope of this paper. A brief summary follows.
From the research that has involved adolescent perceptions of parental power (primarily by McDonald, 1977, 1982), the following conclusions about perceptions seem warranted: (1) Fathers have greater resource control and power of an authoritarian nature. (2) Mothers have greater control in power that involves nurturance and value transmission. (3) Both parents have ex-

pert power in their areas of expertise. (4) The parent of higher status or with higher resources is seen as having higher power (Lueptow, 1980); this parent is generally the father. (5) While the same sex parent has greater power, differentiated perceptions maintain across sexes. (6) Family configuration factors are not highly predictive, although increased family size of children has been found to be associated with increased perceptions of maternal (not paternal) power (Lueptow, 1980). (7) Parental education and occupational prestige, particularly those of the father, are directly associated with perceived parental power.
Failure to find configuration effects on adolescent (or parent) perceptions of parental power seems somewhat surprising, since ordinal position, sibsize, and spacing have been implicated repeatedly in findings pertaining to childparent relationships. For example, one

(6) While sex of sibling is apparently not important relative to such perceptions, sex composition of children is thought to affect parental disciplinary style, parental control, and parental rule explanation.

It is not a simple matter to develop a set of predictions about how the factors cited should affect perceptions of parents in families in developing countries and whether patterns of relationships would be expected to parallel at all those in developed countries. Within developing countries, there are enduring, traditional norms prescribing roles and relationships, in particular concerning the dominant role of males. While men may cede certain roles and certain types of control to wives, such delegation is expected to be in accordance with cultural prescriptions. For example, fathers are authority figures in the family, in charge

of outcome control (punishment and rewards), and their legitimacy in relation to the world and work is defined and expected in the family and in the culture. Mothers are responsible for nurturant, expressive behavior, with culturally prescribed legitimate control as purveyor of moral-ethical and normative values and behaviors.
Being disseminated by the culture, behaviors, roles, and authority patterns should maintain across educational or social-economic classes, although some attenuation in differentiated power patterns might be expected at higher class levels. Based on the literature, it might be expected that family sizes would be large (sometimes "as many as God gives"), and that roles and rules for family size and family ordinal position would exist across classes. Also, greater male, husband, and father power, and thus greater father-mother power differentials, particularly in relation to resource control, should be seen in such settings, in which prescriptions maintain expectations of such control. Such expectations about family structure and parent-child relationships across classes would seem to suggest patterns identified in lower classes or more traditional subcultures in the West. However, research in the Iranian culture (Tashakkori and Mehryar, 1982; Tashakkori and Thompson, unpublished) has revealed strongly differentiated perceptions of parental power, despite the male-dominant nature of the culture and pervasive beliefs in the powerlessness of the Iranian female.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects were 732 adolescents (409 females and 323 males) enrolled in the last year (12th grade) of high school in

Shiraz, the capital city of the Fars province of Iran. Ages ranged between 17 and 21, with a mean of 18.0 (SD = 0.920), and with a majority (93 per cent) between 17 and 19. Subjects were enrolled in 8 schools (4 all-male and 4 all-female) selected to represent different SES backgrounds and geographical locations across the city. Within each school, all 12th grade students completed the questionnaire in groups. In addition to the 732 subjects on whom this report is based, 22 respondents reported they did not live with both parents and were eliminated from the analysis.
Data were collected in 1982, about 4 years after the Islamic Revolution, which had created considerable cultural and political changes in Iran. The data collection questionnaire contained 85 closed- and open-ended questions. Instructions stressed the scientific nature of the investigation. Questionnaires were completed anonymously. Ten items on the questionnaire measured respondents' perceptions regarding parents and/or perceived parental involvement with them in various interaction areas. These questions, completed in an open-ended format, are presented in Table 1. Three of the 6 items (Loving #5, Disappointment #4, and Fear of #9) addressed feelings regarding parents, rather than reports of parental behaviors or interactions. Since loving is seen as the best predictor of referent power (Podsakoff and Schriescheim, 1985), and since fear of parents seems to represent the degree to which parents are perceived as having reward/cost power or outcome-control over the adolscent, all items in Table 1 can be considered as indices of general interaction areas with parents and/or indices of parental power.

TABLE 1
WORDING OF THE QUESTIONS MEASURING THE RESPONDENT'S RELATIONSHIP WITH
PARENTS AND/OR DEGREE OF PARENTAL INVOLVEMENT
1. Which parent encourages you more to study and achieve at school? 2. Which parent encourages you more to continue your education? 3. If you have a problem that bothers you, which parent do you talk to about it? 4. Which parent's disappointment (regarding what you yourself have done) is more annoying to you? 5. Generally speaking, which parent do you love more? 6. If you want to consult regarding your future job, which parent will you consult with, or take his/her
views more into consideration? 7. If you want to make a decision regarding your marriage and selection of your future spouse, which
parent will be consulted FIRST and/or whose opinion will be taken more into consideration? 8. If you do something unacceptable to the family, which parent scolds or punishes you more often? 9. Which parent are you more afraid of? 10. When you were younger, or even now, which parent punished (punishes) you physically?

Responses to these items were coded as: 1 (father), 2 (both or jointly), and 3 (mother). The sum of these responses was then calculated and considered as an index of parental power. The total power (TPOWER) scores had a possible range of 10 (complete paternal) to 30 (complete maternal). The midpoint of 20 was an indicator of egalitarian style and/or equality of power. Detailed information regarding the factorial structure of these questions and their correspondence to French and Raven's (1959) bases of power are presented elsewhere (Tashakkori and Thompson, in press).

educational level (coded as 1 = no formal education, 2 = elementary school, 3 = 7-9 years, 4 = 10-11 years, 5 = high school diploma, 6 = 2 years of college, 7 = four years of college, 8 = postgraduate work); respondent evaluation of own family income (coded on a 5-point response scale ranging from very bad to very good); and number of modern family goods (e.g., radio, TV, refrigerator, washing machine, and so on). A sum of modernity items provided an index (TMODERN) of family (physical) modernity. Table 2 shows the zeroorder correlations between the variables.

Predictor variables included the following family constellation and sociode-
mographic variables: sex; age; birth or-
der; number of siblings; parental

significant increase in R2 when the interaction term was added to Models 1or 2. Hence, presence of an interaction between Order and Nsib could not adequately explain the opposite-sign betas for these variables. Rather, effects of the two are additive. However, each contributed less to the variance of TPOWER when separate than when together with the other variable in the model. (Note that these same effects were found in looking at the interaction of these variables with Sex, although they are not discussed here). A forward regression analysis showed Order entering the model first, with a beta equal to 0.11. The minimum tolerance for entering Nsib, the next largest contributor to the variance of TPOWER, was 0.68, ruling out the possibility of a strong multicollinearity effect. When Nsib was entered into the model (beta = 0.19), the change in R2 was 0.03, F(l,683) = 19.87, p < 0.0001), and the beta corresponding to Order increased to 0.22.
That the combination of the two variables (Nsib and Order) had an effect larger than each separately is, of course, expected. Each ordinal position represents only the number of siblings born before (i.e., older than) the respondent; it provides no information regarding siblings born after (i.e., younger than) the respondent. Information about laterborns requires a combination of Order and Nsib. Subtracting Order from the number of children (Nsib +1) provides a later-born index. For further clarification, number of children born after each subject was calculated in this manner (henceforth, NAFTER). Regression analysis on TPOWER using NAFTER as a predictor is presented in Table 3 (Model 3). Results showed decreased

maternal involvement with an increase in number of younger siblings. Lastborns (NAFTER = 0) reported the greatest maternal involvement (or power), and first-borns (NAFTER = Nsib) the greatest paternal involvement (or power), especially in large families. When both NAFTER and Order were in the model as predictors of TPOWER, Order had a beta of zero; its contribution to the variance of TPOWER was totally explained by NAFTER.
To test this general conclusion and to provide a cross-cultural test of Kidwell's (1981) conclusions regarding effects of birth order on family structure, three dummy variables were created and used in regression analyses similar to Kidwell's: one (FIRST) compared firstborns (1) with others (0); the second (LAST) compared last borns (1) with others (0); and the third (MIDDLE) compared middle borns (1) with others (0). Only children (n = 3) were excluded from analyses (cf. Kidwell, 1981). Following Kidwell's procedure, three separate regression analyses were performed, each including one of the three dummy variables instead of Order in Model 1 of Table 3 (Model 2 leads to the same results, so it is not reported). Results in Table 4 generally show that effects of Nsib were weaker in these models than in Models 1-3. Comparison of the three models in Table 4 indicated that firstborns saw less maternal (more paternal) power than others; last borns saw more maternal power than others and middle-borns were not different from the combination offirst-and last-borns. This does not mean that birth order of the middle-borns did not affect the family structure. While models 1.1 and 1.3 strongly support the above-

mentioned conclusions regarding the NAFTER index (number of younger siblings). Model 1.2, testing middleborns in comparison with combined others, cannot be considered an adequate test of such effects. Further regression analyses were performed, in each of which two dummy variables were in the model to compare each birth order with one other group. Middle-borns did not differ from first- or last-borns, which did differ statistically from each other. Results of this last set of analyses are explained by Models 1 and 1.1 to 1.3. An overall conclusion from all these models might be that differences between different birth orders are gradual, with mother's comparative power increasing with each new child.
In the next step, means were calculated for the first-, middle-, and lastborns, and also within the two sexes. Ignoring Sex, the means of the three groups were 20.15,21.89, and 22.23, respectively (F(2,692) = 5.00, p<0.01, Eta = 0.13). The means for the females and males were 22.03 and 19.75,respectively (F(l,692) = 38.19), p < 0.0001,

Eta = 0.23). The interaction of Sex and Order (first, middle, last) was not significant (F(2,692) = 0.76). Within both sexes, first-borns had the smallest and last-borns the largest means. Hence, the smallest (most paternal) mean (19.44) was present in first-born males and the largest (most maternal) in last-born females (23.71). Respondents were then categorized into two groups according to family size (less than or equal to 4; 5 + children), and means were calculated for the 6 (3 Order by 2 Size) groups. Within both family sizes, the smallest means were present for first-borns, and the largest means were found for lastborns. In the total sample, and for firstand middle-borns, the small-family-size group had a larger mean than the largefamily-size group. Among last-borns, the mean for those from small families. That is, last-born of large families reported slightly more maternal power (mean = 22.78) than did last-borns of small families (mean = 21.91), who reported more maternal power than other groups. Despite these differences, ANOVA did not show a significant in-

teraction of Size and Order (F(2,929) = 0.90), or a main effect of Size (H,692) = 1.08). The main effect of Order remained significant (F(1.692) = 5.91,p< 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS
The analyses reveal the following: (1) In support of a resource theory of conjugal power, perceived parental power is seen to increase with parent's education. A comparative index of parental education (here, father's minus mother's) yields a somewhat clearer prediction. (2) Number of siblings and birth order, as generally calculated, were found to relate in opposite ways with perceived maternal involvement. Reported maternal involvement becomes smaller as family size increases, but larger as birth order increases. These effects appeared not to be interactive but additive.
The finding pertaining to birth order, in particular, appeared somewhat discrepant from much of the research and theory, which suggest that maternal involvement is greatest with early-borns. (3) It was thought that the measure for birth order might more appropriately be one which combined birth order and family size, resulting in an index of number of children born after, rather than before, a respondent. Using such a measure, the greater the number of younger siblings, the less was the reported maternal involvement. Again, last-borns reported the greatest maternal involvement; first-borns reported the least maternal (or most paternal) involvement, particularly in large families. (3)

A direct test was made of Kidwell's arguments pertaining to middle-borns in comparison to first- and last-borns. First- and last-borns were again found to differ from one another (first-borns reporting less, and last-borns more maternal involvement). However, middleborns did not differ significantly from either group. These findings do not support Kidwell's conclusions, but rather suggest that changes in parental involvement may take place somewhat gradually.
In sum, then, results do show that there are effects of birth order and family size on perceptions of parental power. Such perceptions would seem to be representations of parent-child communication patterns and differential parental involvement in interaction with adolescents under study. Results tend to differ from what is generally thought to be true: that early-borns are exposed to more, and later-boms to less, maternal involvement. It may be that this discrepancy from much of the existing literature is due to the use of perceptions of parental power, rather than, for example, reported closeness to parents. While variables pertaining to affection were included here, it is parental dominance within the family that is the primary focus. It seems logical to conclude, as we have here, that maternal dominance increases with family size and birth order, while unmeasured closeness to mother (and/or father) might in fact be related inversely to family size and birth order. Thus, as measured, differential involvement of parents in relation to family size, birth order, and sex of child does seem to mediate effects of family constellation. Further research, including research in other cultures, is needed to test this conclusion.
