ABSTRACT: Evidence from a longitudinal study of the relationship between socioeconomic status and infant mortality in metropolitan Ohio is presented in an effort to throw additional light on the continuing debate over the validity of the age-cause proxy relationship in infancy. The results indicate that while there is a fairly strong and consistent association between neonatal mortality and endogenous causes of death that is little affected by the classification of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, the nature of the association between postneonatal mortality and exogenous causes of death varies from weak to moderate depending upon where this cause is included. Additional evidence pertaining to the role of SIDS in contributing to the long-standing inverse association between infant mortality and socioeconomic status is presented, thus further emphasizing the need for continued research to clarify the etiologic mechanisms of this poorly understood condition.

Recent years have seen a flurry of articles, many of them published in this journal, challenging the validity of the long-standing tradition within the public health literature of equating two period-specific measures of infant mortality--neonatal and postneonatal death rates--with two cause-specific infant mortality rates: the biologically related endogenous causes and the environmentally related exogenous causes (see, for example, Poston and Rogers, 1985; Geronimus, 1986; Poston and Rogers, 1986; Rogers, 1986; Stockwell et al., 1987; Frisbie et al., 1992; Kirby, 1993; and London, 1993).
The basis of this challenge has been that recent medical advances in the care of infants have significantly reduced the proportion of deaths occurring during the neonatal period at the same time that they have extended the endogenous causes past the first

month of life. Specifically, the increasing dominance of endogenous causes throughout infancy reflects those technological advances that have enhanced the survival chances of high risk infants, particularly low-birth-weight babies.
. Because of the advances in neonatal care, many low-birth-weight infants that a few short years ago would have died during the first few hours or days of life now have a much greater chance of surviving the neonatal period. However, such low-birth-weight babies also have a much greater chance than normal infants of dying during the postneonatal period (McCormick, 1985; Brown, 1985).
Direct examination of the age distribution of infant mortality does in fact show not only a decline in the proportion dying during the first month of life, but also that a significant and in-

creasing proportion of the mortality occurring after the first month of life is due to endogenous causes (London, 1993). That is, the recent progress in neonatal care may mean that many high risk infants now have a better chance of surviving infancy and growing to adulthood; but for others it will only mean a short-term temporary postponement of death until some later age in the postneonatal period (Miller, 1985).
The net result of these developments has been that while there continues to be a very close fit between neonatal mortality and endogenous deaths, the validity of using postneonatal mortality as a proxy for exogenous causes of death has been severely limited. Some of those who have commented on these developments have suggested the need to reformulate the definition of the neonatal period (Eberstein and Parker, 1984; Rogers and Poston, 1985; Stockwell, et al., 1987; Kirby, 1993; London, 1993). However, there has been a disagreement as to whether the problem could be eased by shortening the neonatal period or by extending it beyond the first month of life. For example, Poston and Rogers (1985) found that the endogenous causes predominate during the first 18 days, suggesting that 18 rather than 28 days might be a better period-specific cut-off point. Others, however, have suggested that a better age-cause proxy fit could be obtained by extending the neonatal period in order to pick up some of those endogenous-caused deaths now occurring at the postneonatal ages (Rogers, 1986; Stockwell, et al., 1987).
In general, all have agreed on the need to get away from relying on the

traditional age-cause proxy and to focus more directly on the examination of the role of specific causes of death throughout the first year of life. While we would certainly agree with the importance of paying greater attention to the role of particular causes of death throughout infancy, we also believe that the weakening of the postneonatal/exogenous relationship has been overstated. Moreover, the explanation for this overstatement lies in where one classifies Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).
On the one hand, in the initial article in the series cited above that suggested shortening the neonatal period, Poston and Rogers (1985) excluded SIDS from their analysis on the grounds that they had no solid evidence to justify classifying it as either an exogenous or endogenous cause of death; and a number of the studies done since have followed this practice and have omitted SIDS from the period-cause comparisons (Frisbie et al., 1992; Kirby, 1993). On the other hand, the recommendation by Stockwell et al. (1987) pertaining to an extension of the neonatal period was partly encouraged by their inclusion of SIDS with the endogenous causes.
Although SIDS is an ill-defined cause whose etiology is poorly understood, it is a major cause of death in infancy in the United States today (e.g., it accounted for 14 per cent of all infant deaths in 1990) (NCHS, 1993); and where it is included, or if it is omitted from such analyses, could significantly influence the nature of the agecause proxy association. The most recent research on this issue, based on studies of linked records for Florida (Nam et al., 1989) and for the United

States (Leatherman, 1990), has offered strong evidence in support of the designation of SIDS as an exogenous cause; and if it were to be included in this category it would considerably enhance the validity of associating postneonatal mortality with exogenous causes of death. To illustrate, in our earlier research where we included SIDS as an endogenous cause, we found that only 26 per cent of the postneonatal deaths could be attributed to exogenous causes (Stockwell et al., 1987); but had we classified SIDS with the exogenous conditions this fraction would have risen to 52 per cent. The rest of this paper draws on the results of a recently completed study of socioeconomic status and infant mortality in metropolitan Ohio to further explore this issue.
The study in question is part of a longitudinal analysis of the relationship between socioeconomic status and infant mortality in the major metropolitan centers of Ohio dating back to 1960 (Stockwell and Goza, 1994). This study employed an ecological research design in which the census tracts of seven Ohio cities were aggregated into five socioeconomic status areas on the basis of the percentage of families with 1989 income of less than $15,000. The census tracts were aggregated in such a way that approximately 20 per cent of the urban tracts fell into each income area. For each of the income areas, 1989-91 infant mortality rates (total, neonatal, and postneonatal) were calculated, by race, for all deaths and for deaths due to the two major exogenous and endogenous categories. The results of this analysis as they pertain to the socioeconomic mortality differential in infancy have been discussed elsewhere (Stockwell et al., 1994a and

19946). In this paper we confine ourselves to a discussion of the allocation of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome and the nature of the age-cause proxy relationship in infancy.
Table 1 presents the distribution of neonatal and postneonatal deaths in the Ohio metropolitan sample by exogenous and endogenous causes of death based on varying classifications of SIDS. In the top panel, where SIDS is classified as an endogenous condition, there is a very strong fit between neonatal mortality and endogenous causes of death: 94 per cent of the deaths during the first month of life were attributed to this broad category. However, the data show that a pronounced majority of the postneonatal deaths (82 per cent) are also due to endogenous causes. Thus, as we did in our earlier study (Stockwell et al., 1987), we could conclude that the agecause proxy relationship is still very strong for neonatal mortality but has broken down completely for postneonatal mortality.
In the second panel, where we have followed the practice begun by Poston and Rogers (1985) and omitted SIDS from the period-cause comparisons, there continues to be a marked predominance of endogenous deaths in the neonatal period (94 per cent); but there is also a continued predominance of endogenous deaths in the postneonatal period (68 per cent), although it is not nearly as pronounced as when SIDS was included in this cause category. Thus, one would still have to conclude that there was no appreciable association between postneonatal mortality and exogenous causes of death. Overall, deleting SIDS from the analysis had a modest impact of the neonatal-endogenous relationship, but

exogenous conditions was that either social factors affect the etiology of SIDS to a greater degree than would be expected from the medical/biological model, or that deaths to infants of lower socioeconomic status are attributed to SIDS more often than warranted. While our data do not permit us to address either of these two possibilities, we do have data that clearly reveal a pronounced inverse association between the SIDS death rate and family economic status (see Table 2).
These data clearly show a fairly strong and consistent inverse association between the family income status of census tract aggregates and the rate of mortality for all major cause of death groups. However, the strength of the association as measured by the ratio of the death rates in the lowest income group to those of the highest is notably more pronounced for the exogenous conditions. With respect to SIDS, which accounted for 18 per cent of the 1989-91 infant deaths in the Ohio metropolitan aggregate, the ratio is nearly 4 to 1.
While the validity of the age-cause proxy relationship for postneonatalexogenous mortality may not be as weak as some recent studies would suggest, this does not mean that we should continue to regard neonatalpostneonatal trends as indicative of the nature of the health problems faced by newborn infants. Rather, we would emphasize, along with others (e.g., Eberstein and Parker, 1984) the importance of focusing research more directly on enhancing our understanding of the etiology of specific causes of infant deaths.
On the one hand, we need to understand better the determinants of those

endogenous conditions, particularly low birth weight, that are the major causes of neonatal mortality and that account for roughly 7 out of every 10 infant deaths. On the other hand, we need a great deal more research to clarify the determinants of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. SIDS is the second leading cause of death in the United States today (the first in the Ohio metropolitan sample); and its incidence has been increasing.
Part of the problem here is that SIDS is not a homogenous condition and is thus not always amenable to correct diagnosis. On the one hand, some cases reported as SIDS may actually be due to other causes (e.g., Respiratory Distress Syndrome or Suffocation). On the other hand, deaths due to SIDS may be reported as resulting from some other cause. In our Ohio study, for example, the data for 1979-81 showed no deaths from SIDS in the city of Cleveland for those years--at a time when SIDS accounted for roughly 10 per cent of all infant deaths!
Clearly there is a need for further research to enhance our understanding of the etiology of this increasingly important cause of death. On the practical side, a better understanding and control of this single cause would have a substantial impact on the overall level of infant mortality; and, given its notably greater prevalence among lower economic status groups, it might contribute significantly to a reduction in this long-standing differential.
