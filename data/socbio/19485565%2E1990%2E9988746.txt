ABSTRACT: The economic approach to fertility is an application of the economics theory of consumer behavior. It is assumed that consumers of children are utility-maximizers with stable preferences over time. Thus, changes in fertility are related to changes in household income and the "price" of children. One concern in this approach is that demographic changes are a product of changes in tastes rather than exogenous changes in economic factors such as the earning ability of women. In this paper, the effect of economic variables on the demand for children in the United States in 1950, 1960, 1970, and 1980 is examined. Support is provided for the hypothesis that the earning ability of women is an important determinant of fertility.

1960, 1970, and 1980. Fertility is measured per woman rather than per woman married because the marriage rate is also a function of some of the same determinants of fertility (see Becker, 1981). Thus, the effect of economic factors on fertility may be both direct and indirect. Data are at the state level (excluding Alaska and Hawaii).
For the estimates of fertility, median income of males and females 35to 44 are used as proxies for male and female wages, respectively, for 1950,1960, and 1970. Mean earnings of males and females 35 to 44 employed at least 40 weeks in 1979 are entered to adjust for male and female wages for 1980. The above are used as proxies for the actual wage rates because average state wage rates for men and women are not available over time. Female earnings are entered to adjust for the effect of the value of female time on the demand for children. Male earnings are entered to capture the income effect. Male earnings are used rather than family income because family income is related to the labor market status of women which, in turn, is a function of fertility.
Since female earnings may be endogenous with fertility (Sander, 1986; Schultz, 1985), an estimate of female earnings is used in the fertility regressions. Estimated earnings is based upon the industry-mix in a state derived as follows.
Following Bowen and Finegan (1969), I constructed a female-industrymix variable for the 48 states used. First, I broke down employment into 25 industrial categories for 1950 and 1960and 34 categories for 1970 and 1980. These categories accounted for all of the employed workers in the United States (see Tables 1 and 2). Second, I calculated what per cent of the workers in each cat-

egory were female. Third, I calculated how many women would be employed in each industry at the state level if the state conformed to relative employment levels for women at the national level. For example, if 10 per cent of workers in agriculture at the national level are women, 10 per cent of the jobs in agriculture at the state level are allocated to women. The total number of jobs that are allocated to women in a state are then divided by the total number of jobs in the state to derive the femaleindustry-mix variable. Thus, one derives a measure that can be used to predict the demand for female workers in a state. The relationships between female earnings and the industry mix (IM) and female work and the industry-mix are shown in Table 3.
It is recognized that the wage variables are imprecise measures of the value

of time, particularly for females. One of the problems with the measure is that labor supply decisions affect their levels, particularly for 1950, 1960, and 1970. This is a particular problem for females because female labor supply decisions tend to vary relative to males. Thus, whereas male labor supply can be assumed to be independent of fertility, female labor supply is endogenous with decisions regarding family size. Although it would be preferable to have better measures of wage rates, they are not available at this level of aggregation during earlier periods.

Another problem with the data is that the proxies that are used for wages do not precisely reflect the value of time when decisions regarding children are being made. I would note, however, that if one lags the wage rates by a decade, the results do not appreciably change.
To provide another test of the hypothesis that female earning ability has a negative effect on fertility, the estimated female wage is replaced by an estimate of the labor force participation rate for females age 35 to 44. Since female labor supply decision is endogenous with fertility, as noted above, an estimate of it that is also based on the industry-mix in a state will be used.
Adjustments are also made for population density and per cent living in urban areas, since the price of children may be affected by location. On one hand, the cost of children may be higher

in more urbanized and densely populated states because of, for example, higher housingcosts. However,the cost of child quality may be affected byloca-

tion, as well. During earlier periods of time, it has been argued that schooling quality wassuperiorin urban areasrelative to rural areas (Schultz, 1967). Thus,

the price of child quality would be higher in rural areas relative to cities. More recently, evidence indicates that schools in large cities tend to be relatively inferior (Schultz, 1981), thus increasing the price of quality (and decreasing the price of quantity) of city children. This implies that the effect of location on fertility is ambiguous and may vary over time. In addition, it has been shown that fertility is higher among farmers (Sander, 1986). Since the per cent in farming tends to be higher in less urbanized, more sparsely populated states, the density and urban adjustments tend to pick up the farm effect, as well. In preliminary work with the data, I could not separate out a farm

effect. Also, in preliminary work with the data I could not separate out a female schooling effect. Since female schooling and per cent in farming have no bearing on the results, they are excluded in the empirical analysis.
The data are taken from issues of the StatisticalAbstract of the UnitedStates and the Censuses of Population since 1950. Summary statistics for the data set are provided below (Table 5).
