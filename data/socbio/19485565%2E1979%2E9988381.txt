ABSTRACT:Several techniques for preselecting the sex of offspring are available now or will be in the near future. Although hundreds of studies indicate that sons are desired by the overwhelming proportion of persons asked, few studies ask whether preselecting of sex of offspring ought to be made available generally, as the technologies become perfected. In northern California, 2,138 respondents indicated widespread acceptance of ongoing biomedical research to perfect preselection methods and of making these procedures available to potential parents. Almost half agreed that they might want to use such techniques. Variation in levels of agreement were assessed by sex, race, marital status, child-parity, religious affiliation and attendance, level of education, class, and general attitudes toward medical and scientific leaders. The implications of the general acceptability of sex selection go far beyond the freedom of parental choice--to such matters as socialization patterns of first son, second daughter ordering, sex role inflexibilities, sex ratio imbalances, and also include possibilities for curtailing rapid population growth.

The ideas people hold about the desirability of sons or daughters and ideas about the appropriateness of preselecting the sex of children vary from one culture to another. While there has been a great deal of information collected on sex preference, there is little available data on attitudes toward actual sex preselection. Perhaps the possibility of choosing the sex of offspring has not been taken seriously, but current biomedical research procedures are about to supply several easy, cheap, and relatively accurate techniques.
There is a widespread belief across all political systems that facilitating human choice, when it does not interfere with the rights of the state or other persons, is a positive goal. Thus, if couples desire a son as a first child, why not help them achieve

their goal? Or, if parents would be willing to limit the numbers of children they produce by obtaining sex-parity goals, the limits to population growth could be of benefit to entire societies and the biosphere as well. Many parents have been sadly disappointed in trying again and again in childbirth to achieve the desired sex. Now, the implied numerical goals of the family planning motto "every child a wanted child" may be expanded to include the wanted sex of offspring.
In this paper we examine the current and potential techniques of sex preselection, previous research on sex preferences, attitudes toward choosing the sex of offspring, including details of our own survey results, and finally, we examine some of the implications of the potential use of the technologies being perfected.

THE TECHNOLOGY OF SEX PREDETERMINATION
Sex preselection techniques have been developed over time from research that originated with other goals: e.g., research into techniques for helping infertile or subfertile couples conceive and research into the prenatal health of the fetus. The state of the art is so advanced that some of the more available techniques of sex preselection are already being used by couples in many nations of the world. Other techniques are still in the experimental stage, but offer greater promise for successfully determining the progeny's sex, most typically before conception. The newer methods promise to be "easy, cheap, and virtually free from error" (Ericsson, 1976).
As far back as the 1920's in Germany, Unterberger (1932) reportedly experimented with altering the acid-alkali balance of the vagina in order to influence the female-male conception ratio. Repeated tests did not affirm the efficacy of the method, but years later, used in conjunction with a whole set of procedures during coitus, high proportions of successful sex selection were reported. It was in the late 1960's that Landrum Shettles (Rorvik and Shettles, 1970) detailed the system that he claims to be as high as 80 to 90 per cent effective. The technique is elucidated in detail in a book that has been translated into over thirteen languages (Rorvik and Shettles, 1971) and practiced by unknown numbers of couples around the world. The procedures for predeterming the sex of offspring involve precise timing with reference to ovulation and frequency of sexual intercourse, douching with a prescribed acidic or alkaline solution prior to intercourse, and specific positioning during the act of intercourse. An advantage lies in the fact that the technique may be utilized by couples in the privacy of the home, but

it is estimated to have lower actual probabilities of success than are expected with new methods.1
Roberts of Guy's Medical School in London (1972) discovered that the Xbearing sperm was richer in DNA and therefore fatter than the Y-type sperm. This caused the X-chromosome-bearing sperm to swim slower than the Ychromosome-bearing sperm. That knowledge sparked research in sperm separation in test tubes. Ericsson, Langevin, and Nishino at the Schering Laboratory in Berlin used a dense fluid that separated out the less active sperm, which are predominantly the female-producing Xbearing type, allowing the more active Ybearing sperm to swim through and collect at the bottom of the fluid, increasing the concentration from about 50 to as much as 85 per cent (Ericsson et al., 1973, p. 424). The technique is used to select Y-bearing sperm only. Since some defective sperm with disordered chromosomes will be concentrated with the X-bearing type, daughter choice by the method is currently inadvisable. Ericsson, continuing his research in California, is using sperm separation with artificial insemination on human patients. Dr. W. Paul Dmouski of the Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago uses the same method. These two researchers report the method has produced eleven male and three female children.
Meanwhile, at the Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center, Bennett and Boyse (1973) destroyed a large number of male sperm in mice with an antiserum chemical which seeks out and destroys Ybearing sperm. They found that 8 per cent more female mice were born with treated than with untreated sperm.
1In the time between the 1971 and 1977 editions of their book, Rorvik and Shettles claim to have received almost three thousand letters from couples who used their method in which fewer than a dozen reported failure.

Another research technique involves subjecting thinned semen to electrophoresis. The hypothesis is that sperm bearing X chromosomes will be drawn to the positive electrode, while Y chromosomes will be drawn to the negative electrode. Artificial insemination could then be used with semen of the chosen sex-chromosomal concentration. Experimental work with rabbits and cattle has produced inconsistent results.
The Chinese have conducted research on sex preselection with amniocentesis, a medical procedure widely used to determine the health of, and possible defects in, the unborn fetus. At the Teitung Hospital of the Anshan Iron and Steel Company, amniocentesis is being used to predict the sex of the fetus as early as the 47th day after conception. Cells of fetal origin are obtained from the reproductive tract of the mother during the first trimester and analyzed for Barr body (cell structures found normally only in females). Abortion prior to the twelfth week is possible. This is the only technique being studied or utilized that would allow an early post-conception decision on aborting a fetus of unwanted sex. Early research indicated accurate sex prediction in 93 out of 100 cases. Thirty of these sets of parents chose abortion, and in 29 of those cases the predicted sex was female (Campbell, 1976).
Meanwhile, Shettles has also been experimenting with filters of varying configurations that will allow the slightly smaller male-producing sperm to pass through (Shettles, 1978). This technique is not as easy as it may sound, since the main body of the sperm is only 1/8,000 of an inch across.
Of the many techniques being studied, selective abortion and sperm separation in combination with artificial insemination seem to be the two methods most likely to be available and utilized in the near future. It is impossible to know at this early

date the probable extent of use of these techniques as they are perfected. It is possible, however, to tap current attitudes toward the increasing availability of techniques and to determine the importance given to ongoing biomedical attempts to perfect the technologies.
PREVIOUS RESEARCH
ATTITUDES TOWARD SEX SELECTION
In spite of the vast literature on the salience of sex of offspring to individuals, couples, and extended families, and the hundred of research reports detailing son preference (see Williamson, 1976), there has been little attitudinal research on sex predetermination.
In 1968 Markle and Nam sampled students at three colleges in Florida, asking if they would like to choose the sex of their future children. Of the 283 persons or 64 per cent responding, 26 per cent were favorable to the idea, 41 per cent were not favorable, and the remainder were not sure or had no preference. While 37 per cent of blacks were favorable, only 22 per cent of whites were so disposed. Malefemale differences were slight, with slightly higher proportions of males favorable. Fewer single (23 per cent) than married respondents (36 per cent) were favorable to sex preselection. Variations in reported responses were greatest for those with different religious orientations. While only 9 per cent of Catholics were favorable, 27 per cent of Protestants and 38 per cent of those with no religious affiliation were favorable to the use of these procedures. As will be evident below, the 1968 Florida results were very different from those of our respondents in northern California in 1977.

racial distribution from the 1970 census. While black and white respondents were equal to proportions, we have twice the percentage of Orientals and only onethird the percentage of SpanishAmericans as were recorded by the census. In terms of religious background, Catholics were overrepresented in the sample (29.4 per cent) as compared to the larger population. Of the sample, 18.1 per cent indicated that they were Protestant Fundamentalists; 20.7 per cent, Protestant non-Fundamentalists; 5.3 per cent, Jewish; 7 per cent, other; and 19.6 per cent, no religious background or atheists.
While the sample cannot be considered representative of even the college population in general, much less all adults in the United States, it does have the advantage of being heavily weighted with persons in the early-to-middle stages of reproductive decision-making. College students are often thought to be opinion leaders, and thus even these off-the-top-of-the-head attitudes should be of interest in them-

selves, and as bench marks for future measurement.
Three distinctly different questions were asked regarding the predetermination of the sex of offspring. The intent was to get at three different aspects of the issue.
At the very beginning of the questionnaire a series of statements were offered to tap levels of agreement vs. disagreement. The introductory statement indicated: "Genetic counseling is now available in some communities as a part of birth planning. Please let us know how you feel now about the following: 1. If it becomes possible to predetermine the sex of offspring, such a possibility should be available to all parents. 2. Would you want to use such a procedure?" Six possible responses from strongly agree to strongly disagree were provided. A whole series of Likert-type statements followed, and then a new section was introduced: "With regard to ongoing biomedical research, what priority would you give the following: Sex prede-

termination. . . ." Choices included: (1) high priority, (2) moderate priority, (3) low priority, (4) prohibit, and (5) no opinion.
RESULTS
Initial response patterns to the three basic questions on sex predetermination are reported in Table 1. Of our respondents, 65.9 per cent checked some level of agreement with the idea that if predetermination of the sex of offspring becomes possible, the procedure should be available to all parents. Yet, when the respondents were asked if they would want to use such a procedure, only 44.6 per cent answered affirmatively. In coding the questionnaires, it was clear that many respondents had different attitudes on the general as opposed to the personal aspects of the issue.3
When it came to giving a priority to the ongoing biomedical research in this area, less than 10 per cent of these respondents gave this item a high priority. Moderate to low priorities were the overwhelming choice. Indeed, it appears that a different dimension has been tapped in the importance of ongoing research. Nevertheless, while this technology does not achieve highest ranking, neither does it have many detractors, with only 13.5 per cent wanting to prohibit the research altogether. (Six of nine biomedical research areas had higher proportions of respondents willing to prohibit research.)
Comparing these results with the ear-
3Although our respondents were assumed to have little knowledge about the specific techniques of sex preselection, when we took a before-after survey of students in a class in genetic engineering, we found that detailed knowledge of the various techniques did not alter attitudes of respondents. Also, biology majors were not vastly different from others in response patterns.
Statistical significance levels, when given here, are listed for reference only, as the sampling requirements necessary for reliance on these tests of significance are very rarely met in survey research.

Her report of a college-age Florida sample (Markle and Nam, 1971), and with the National Fertility Survey of married women (Westoff and Rindfuss, 1974), we find we have a much higher level of acceptance. Whether we focus on the proportion who might want to use techniques of sex predetermination or the nearly 66 per cent who would be open to the possible use by any and all parents, the favorable attitudes exceed by far the 38.8 per cent of women in the 1970 National Fertility Study who said they were "for" the possible choice of sex of a child (Westoff and Rindfuss, 1974, p. 635) or the 26 per cent of college students "favorable" on the Florida survey. It may be that attitudes toward preselecting the sex of offspring are becoming more favorable over time, or that our California respondents are more open to the technique, or that we are seeing a combination of these possibilities.4
HYPOTHESES TESTED
On the basis of reported research, our three pretests, and a general familiarity with previous studies of fertility, we had hypothesized that:
1. Males would be more likely than females to indicate favorable attitudes toward sex predetermination.
2. Nonwhites would be more likely than whites to favor sex predetermination.
3. Married respondents would be more likely than single respondents to favor sex predetermination.
4. Respondents without children would be less likely than those with children to indicate favorable attitudes toward sexpredetermination.
5. Respondents reporting no religious preference would be most likely, Protestants next most likely, and Catholics least likely to favor sex predetermination.
6. Those who report little or no church attendance would be more likely than those
4We will be attempting a follow-up survey with some of our 1977 respondents as well as studying a small new sample, so that we may be able to report attitude change over time on several of these issues.

With regard to the first hypothesis, overall male/female differences were not in evidence. Unlike the college sample of Markle and Nam (1971) or our own adult sample, this larger sampling showed remarkable similarity for the sexes on each question. Comparing male-female responses within racial groups however, highlighted some curious results. Both black and Oriental women were more likely than their male counterparts to strongly favor sex predetermination. We also found statistically significant differences by parenthood for the first two relevant questions. Men without children but women with children were most likely to strongly agree that sex predetermination should be available to all parents and

It should be noted that although black and Latino respondents were most likely to strongly agree that sex predetermination should be available to all parents (Table 2), the Oriental respondents were most likely (73.6 per cent) to agree overall and least likely to strongly disagree. Racial differences were somewhat greater for females and reduced among males. The black/white differences were also increased for those at the lowest educational levels (twelve or fewer years of formal education) and virtually disappear among graduate students. Whites who had lived

most of their lives in the southeastern or southwestern United States reported attitudes like those of black respondents.
When asked if they might want to predetermine the sex of their own offspring (Table 3), blacks again were most likely to strongly agree, though this difference was exaggerated among females and disappears among males. In this case, Latinos are least likely to strongly agree, but Orientals are again most likely to agree overall and least likely to strongly disagree. Educational levels had an unexpected influence in that while blacks with twelve or fewer years of formal education were again most likely to strongly agree, both blacks and whites who were graduate students were more likely to agree or strongly agree than was true for those in the middle years of college.
Racial differences were greatest on the issue of assigning priorities to ongoing

biomedical research into the predetermination of the sex of children (see Table 4). Blacks were clearly very much more likely than any other category to grant high priority to perfecting this technology. While black women were three times as likely as white women to grant high priority, black males were twice as likely as white males to give the research highest priority. Whites who lived most of their lives in the south were twice as likely as whites from the western United States to highly value this procedure. Respondents at the lower and higher levels of college inflated the racial differences reported overall. The Oriental respondents were least likely to want to prohibit the research. Surprisingly, blacks were most willing to prohibit (less likely to take a moderate position about) ongoing research into methods of sex predetermination of offspring.

Following the research of Markle and Nam (1971, p. 79), we had hypothesized that married respondents would be more likely than unmarried to favor sex predetermination. With about twice as many respondents, and four times as many evermarried respondents as Markle and Nam, we found statistically significant differences by marital status on all three of our questions (see Tables 2, 3, and 4). However, the most agreeable groups were those who were cohabiting, widowed, separated or divorced, and then married and single. The relationship between priority given to sex predetermination and marital status disappeared when we controlled for presence or absence of children. Those with some children were more likely (13.5 per cent) than those with no children (8.4 per cent) to give highest priority to perfecting methods of predetermining sex of offspring.

children the respondents already had, there was a statistically significant negative correlation (r=0.076) between the number of children and agreement with the availability of sex predetermination to potential parents. In examining the data in detail, however, we found that the relationship was not linear. Those reporting that they already had one or three children were most likely to strongly agree to making generally available the techniques of sex predetermination. Of those with three children, 30 per cent strongly agreed that they might want to use the techniques, while those with only one child were very much more likely than those at any other parity to give a high priority to ongoing research into predetermination of the sex of offspring. These results fit very nicely with

the strong preferences for sex balancing reported in the National Fertility Study. Of parents of one child, whether it was a boy or girl, 80 per cent wanted the next child to be the opposite sex.
Hypothesis 5 suggests that respondents reporting no religious preference would be most likely to favor and consider using methods of predetermining the sex of offspring. While the proposition appears to find some confirmation in the case of availability of technologies, respondents of Jewish background were about as likely as those without affiliation to either strongly agree or agree on general availability and on their own possible use of sex predetermination. Catholics were not significantly different from Protestants in response patterns. The variation in priori-
