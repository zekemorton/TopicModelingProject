The development and acceptance of the intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) as one of the several methods of birth control are important landmarks in the history of family planning. This device is considered as an effective, safe, and suitable one both for the spacing of children and for preventing births. On the basis of studies for two years on some 3,500 women, the Indian Council of Medical Research recommended the use of the IUCD as a method of birth control in India, and the Government of India decided to provide facilities for IUCD insertion in the hospitals and primary health centers all over the country beginning in June, 1965.
In Kerala, the most densely populated state in India, where the need for population control is all the more great, facilities for IUCD insertion were provided in the hospitals and dispensaries beginning in July, 1965. By the end of July, 1968,126,905 loop insertions had been made. The women who accept the loop are given five rupees each, and the doctor who inserts the loop receives two rupees. The promoter gets one rupee per case.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
The present study is based on the details of IUCD acceptors collected from two hospitals in the city of Trivandrum, Kerala, South India. The period covered is from July, 1965, to March, 1967. There were 1,088 insertions in one hospital and 170 in the other. Some of the demographic particulars of the IUCD acceptors and the

dates of last delivery and last menstruation are recorded in the prescribed registers in both the hospitals. However, the nature of complaints and dates of expulsion, removal, or reinsertion which are expected to be recorded in the follow-up register on the basis of inquiries conducted by field workers like Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMS) are available only for the 170 cases registered at the second hospital where regular followup visits are reported to be conducted.
In the present paper, the following will be studied:
1. Demographic characteristics of women who have adopted IUCD's, such as age, religion, and number of living children at the time of IUCD insertion.
2. Timing of the IUCD insertion with respect to last delivery and last menstrual period.
3. Rates of expulsions, removals and reinsertions for those cases where data are available.
RESULTS
AGE DISTRIBUTION OP IUCD ACCEPTORS
Since it is a method of spacing rather than terminating childbearing, women in the lower age groups are the ones who should accept the IUCD. However, age alone does not decide the stage of childbearing and older women might also have the loop inserted either for the purpose of spacing or for the purpose of avoiding future pregnancies until the menopause is attained.
Table 1 gives the age distribution of 1,239 cases, excluding 19 cases for which age was not furnished. To enable easy comparison,

the distribution of currently married women 15-44 years of age in the state is also given.
As may be seen, the age group 25-29 years contains the maximum percentage of women among the IUCD acceptors. The modal age group was also found to be 25-29 years in the study conducted by the Demographic Training and Research Centre in Bombay (Asha, 1966) and the Central Family Planning Institute in Delhi (Murty, 1967). In respect to the extremely low and high age groups, the percentage of acceptors is much lower than the corresponding population percentages of married women at these ages, a feature which is strikingly similar to that in the analysis of data by Murty (1967). The proportion of IUCD acceptors in the age group 20-24 years is more or less the same as the proportion of currently married women in this age group in Kerala.
If we consider the age group 20-34 years as a whole, we find that 80% of the acceptors belong to this group, even though the corresponding percentage of currently married women in the age group is only 64%. This concentration of women in the age groups which are crucial from the point of view of reproductive behavior is a welcome sign.
The study conducted by the Institute of Rural Health and Family Planning, Gandhigram (1966), has also shown that 90% of IUCD acceptors belong to the age group 25-29 years. While the study of acceptors at the Rural Health Training center in Njafgarh (Bhandari, 1967) has shown that 57.2% belong to the age group 25-34 years, the Lucknow study (Seghal and Pandy, 1967) showed 71-72% as belonging to the 2535 age group. The Delhi study (Baradwaj, 1967) showed 60% belonging to the 15-30 age group and 50% belonging to the 30-39 age group. A comparison of these studies with the present one has shown broad similarities in age distribution of women accepting IUCD; only the Lucknow sample

(Seghal and Pandy, 1967) shows a slight variation.
The median age of insertion of the acceptors is found to be 27.8 years. This is only one year less than the median age of 28.8 years arrived at by the Central Family Planning Institute in Delhi (Murty, 1967) which itself is lower than that found in various studies conducted in other countries.

cording to 1961 census of the population of Trivandrum District, 71%are Hindus, 18% Christians, and 11% Muslims. A comparison of these proportions with the proportion of the women acceptors according to religion shows that a relatively smaller percentage of Christians and Muslims have adopted the IUCD (Table 2). However, the fact that nearly 10% of IUCD acceptors among the cases considered are Christians and 4% are Muslims suggests that even though there are religious objections in some quarters people are adopting this method either because of necessity or due to the financial incentives provided.

NUMBER OF LIVING CHILDREN
The data in Table 3 indicate that about 24% of the women had exactly 3 living children; andnearly 58% had 3 or less children living at the time of IUCD insertion. Another study made in the Demographic Training and Research Centre (Mohanty and Rao, 1967) also showed that 60%of

fewer children and are therefore accepting the IUCD at an early stage of their fertility period, presumably for the purpose of spacing.
The average number of living children for the women at the time of IUCD insertion is3.5, which isnearly one child less than the average number (4.4) obtained in a study of women enrolled in an urban clinic in Delhi (Agarwala, 1968).

average interval in months of fitting the IUCD after the last delivery is 16 months in Agarwala's study, whereas in the present study it is only 14.2 months. The indications are that the timing of the IUCD insertion in relation to last delivery is more appropriate, among Kerala women. A possible reason is that the hospital staff motivate the women who had delivered in these hospitals to accept IUCD and also cause the insertions to take place without much loss of time.
INTERVAL BETWEEN IUCD INSERTION AND LAST MENSTRUAL PERIOD
Doctors have recommended the first few days after a menstrual period as the most appropriate time for IUCD insertion, as this will minimize the chances of conception. How far this objective is achieved can be broadly determined by an analysis of the distribution of women according to interval between last menstrual period (LMP) and IUCD insertion. This type of analysis has not been attempted in any of the previous studies referred to in this paper. The details are presented in Table S.
Nearly 12% of the women had accepted the loop within a week and about 47% within 14days of the last menstrual period. In motivating women for IUCD insertion, there is greater need to emphasize the importance of fitting the IUCD immediately after the menstrual period so as to avoid the risk of conception having taken place before IUCD insertion, which will give room for spurious propaganda of conception occurring with the IUCD inserted. However, nearly 44% had the insertion in the critical period after the last menses. Presumably the necessary tests might have been made in these cases to make sure that fertilization had not taken place before the insertion. I t may also be noted here that some of the women might not be having the regular menstrual cycle. A classification of these cases by age and parity, not attempted here, might reveal interesting correlations.

EXPULSIONS, REMOVALS AND REINSERTIONS
Due to paucity of data, the rates of expulsion, removal, and reinsertion are based on the follow-up data of only 170 cases in the second hospital. The cut-off date is fixed as March 31,1967.
The analysis of clinical data is most conveniently carried out in terms of segments. A segment is defined as a period of use starting with a first or later insertion and either terminated by an event such as accidental pregnancy, expulsion, removal, or continuing as of the cut-off date. A case with no event after the first insertion corresponds to a

single segment; each reinsertion contributes one additional segment. An event not followed by reinsertion constitutes a closed case. From the above data, the womanmonths of use and rates of each event and closure are computed. The rates of expulsion, removal and reinsertion per 100 women during a year are 10.58, 6.81, and 8.44 respectively. The rate of closure, that is removal or expulsion not followed by reinsertion, is 9.14 per 100 women for a year. Thus, 91.86% of the cases are active after one year. This may perhaps be due to the extreme interest taken by the staff of the hospital, both in canvassing as well as in the follow-up and not, therefore, a representative figure.
