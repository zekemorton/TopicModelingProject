ABSTRACT: Motives for sex control include avoidance of sex-linked disease and realization of preferred sex compositions of children. Currently, the only wholly effective means of sex control is diagnosis of fetal sex by mid-trimester karyotyping of amniotic fluid cells followed by corrective abortion when diagnosis is adverse. Unfortunately the delays involved in karyotyping mean that abortion cannot be minimum-risk suction curretage. Radioimmunoassay procedures allow somewhat earlier diagnosis and therefore less risky abortion, but entail more diagnostic error. In the first part of the paper, several assay procedures are evaluated in terms of relative expense as compared to karyotyping, gestational age when reliability is highest, and level of that reliability. Later portions of the paper focus on use of radioimmunoassay to diagnose fetal sex for purposes of regulating the sex composition of offspring. Three strategies are compared with respect to their efficiency and expected levels of diagnosis and abortion.

Determination of fetal sex early in pregnancy is of interest both from a family planning and a disease prevention perspective. A number of X-linked genetic defects result in male children being afflicted with such diseases as hemophilia, muscular dystrophy, and enzyme deficiency disorders. The incidence of both hemophilia and muscular dystrophy is roughly 1 per 10,000 births, with the enzyme disorders much less common. However, for families with a history of these diseases, male offspring have a 50 per cent chance of being afflicted. Fetal sex diagnosis and selective abortion of male fetuses for families with a known history can prevent births of affected males. In addition, a potentially larger group of families may wish to use sex preselection to determine the sex composition of offspring for reasons of personal preference.

Sex preselection strategies will differ, depending on the couple's underlying motives for regulation of the offspring's sex. If the couple wishes to prevent inheritance of genetically linked disorders, they will want to abort all male fetuses. Since the costs of incorrect diagnosis of a male fetus are high, they will want to have certain diagnosis of males. If any errors are to be found in diagnoses, it certainly is preferred that they be females diagnosed incorrectly as males than the other way around. On the other hand, couples who want to regulate the sex composition of their family may wish to have equal reliability of diagnosis, but may not feel as strongly that fetal sex diagnosis need be absolutely certain.
Currently, the only certain method of fetal sex diagnosis is karyotyping or genetic analysis of cells cultured from a

sample of amniotic fluid. But karyotyping is expensive and involves delay in obtaining results. The delay for diagnosis typically means that the lower cost and lower maternal risk suction curettage type abortions cannot be employed when the fetus is diagnosed as being of the undesired sex. Accordingly, it is of major interest whether any alternative ways of diagnosis exist that are both cheaper and yield earlier assessments of fetal sex.
A first objective of this paper is to assess the diagnostic utility of certain noninvasive, nonamniotic approaches as well as certain assay procedures that do require amniotic fluid. The principal criteria are relative expense as compared to karyotyping, gestational age when reliability is highest, and level of that reliability. We will consider separately reliabilities for diagnosis of males and females, to reflect the different strategies identified above. Although none of the diagnostic procedures alone offers virtually 100 per cent accuracy, combining two procedures can give 90 per cent accuracy or better, along with a savings of two to three weeks in diagnosis time and consequent reductions in cost and maternal risk from abortion.
In the second part of the paper we will focus on the strategies appropriate for controlling sex of offspring for personal reasons. We will examine the degree of diagnostic reliability and strictness of control by abortion required when the couple wants to dictate the sex composition of two or more children involving both sexes but do not care about the order in which sons and daughters come. In this section we will show how less than 100 per cent reliable fetal sex diagnosis increases the chance of failure in obtaining a desired sex composition.

Additionally, a desire to minimize the number of selective abortions will also increase the chance of failure.
ALTERNATIVE DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES
EVALUATION CRITERIA
In judging the utilities of other diagnostic procedures besides karyotyping of amniotic fluid cells, we find three main criteria are relevant: expense, gestational age at time of highest reliability, and level of that reliability.
Before discussing the explicit criteria for adopting a sex control regime, let us first present relevant statistics for conceptions. For each pregnancy there is roughly a 50 per cent chance of either sex having been conceived. Kobrin and Potter (forthcoming) show that, allowing for spontaneous abortions, the average number of pregnancies required to result in a live birth is 1.32; thus, adoption of a sex preselection strategy doubles the number of pregnancies to 2.64 to achieve a child of a specified sex. For each child for whom the couple regulates sex, the woman must undergo, on the average, two diagnoses and one abortion. This constitutes a substantial burden of diagnosis and abortion, delay between births, and risk associated with abortions. Further, the burden increases with each additional regulated birth. Clearly, it would be desirable to reduce the burdens or risks of sex preselection for couples opting to control the sex composition of their children.
The costs and risks are not the only criteria by which diagnostic procedures must be judged, however. Reliability is perhaps the most important criterion. In sex-linked disorders there is an unavoid-

able 50 per cent abortion of normal fetuses based on 100 per cent reliable sex determination. Physicians and families may accept this error, given the high stakes, in disease prevention, but may not for family planning purposes. Given the high costs of counseling, diagnosis, and abortion, it is unreasonable to expect either group to accept a diagnosis which has greater than 5 to 10 per cent error in sex determination.
If diagnosis could be performed very early in the pregnancy--that is, no later than the first trimester--then both the risks from abortion and delays between births could be reduced. However, the currently more reliable tests require amniocentesis, which cannot be performed much earlier than gestational week 14or 15. Prior to this time there is too little amniotic fluid to allow penetration of the amniotic sac and a withdrawal of fluid without damaging the fetus with the needle. The culturing of cells and their karyotyping typically consumes an additional two or three weeks, delaying diagnosis until the sixteenth or seventeenth week. Unfortunately, the delay well into the second trimester increases the abortion-related maternal mortality.
Delay to diagnosis may be reduced in two ways: by analysis of amniotic fluid with methods quicker than karyotyping or by diagnosis without amniocentesis. Presently, the more reliable fetal sex diagnosis is obtained with radioimmunoassay of amniotic sex hormones. Diagnosis is available immediately upon amniocentesis, at about weeks 14 or 15, still early enough for a dilation and evacuation abortion. Earlier, but less reliable, noninvasive techniques would allow lowest-risk suction curettage abortions.
Maternal mortality from abortion in-

creases with gestational age and further increases with a shift to instillation-type abortions. Up to the twelfth week of gestation, curettage may be used to abort a fetus. In the United States during 1972-77 the maternal mortality rate was 1.2 per 100,000 cases for suction curettage abortions. From the thirteenth to sixteenth week, however, dilation and evacuation is generally used, and its maternal mortality rate is 8.3 per 100,000, seven times higher than the rate for curettage. After the sixteenth week, instillation procedures may be necessary, with a further increase in maternal mortality to 15 or 20 per 100,000. Additionally, the risk of other major complications is roughly 2.5 times higher for instillation than dilation and evacuation abortions (Cates and Grimes, 1981; pp. 168, 172). Clearly, later abortions pose substantially higher risks to the mother. Both physicians and couples may be willing to forego some reliability in fetal sex diagnosis in order to reduce maternal risks.
Not only do maternal risks rise with gestational age, so do the costs of the abortion procedures. In Providence, Rhode Island, the 1982 cost for a dilation and evacuation abortion was $300. Saline injection abortions are more than twice that amount, $665; and if complications require additional hospitalization, costs further increase. For both cost and risk reasons, couples will obviously prefer earlier diagnosis.
The key question is whether reliabilities of assay diagnoses are high enough to justify them as definitive diagnostic procedures, and if not, whether they are useful as a screening device. In the latter case, when amniotic fluid is collected for assay, if the results are not definitive a portion of the remaining sample may still be used for karyotyping. Thus, it is

enough that the assays yield decisive diagnoses in the majority of instances so that karyotyping is required only a minority of times.
NONINVASIVE PROCEDURES
Several noninvasive procedures use as a source serum or urine samples instead of amniotic fluid. They command the advantage of much less expense, and one of them at least has the advantage of much earlier diagnosis. The critical issue is again reliability of diagnosis. Unless reliabilities of 90 per cent or higher are attainable, it is hard to believe that either patient or physician would have enthusiasm for basing abortion decisions upon them. Five techniques not relying on amniocentesis merit brief review.
Sonography (ultra-sound, ectography).--Sonography requires sufficient differentiation of the genitalia that these may be distinguished with ultra-sound procedures. According to Stocker and Evens (1977), this condition is not realized before 26-30 weeks, too late for an elective abortion; hence, sonography is not a feasible alternative to karyotyping.
Human chorionic gonadotropin (hcG).-Danzer et al. (1980) collected maternal serum samples from 560 women. They found significantly higher hcG in the serum of women with female fetuses than of those with male ones, but the maximum difference occurs in the third trimester. Again, detection occurs too late in pregnancy for the procedure to afford an attractive basis for diagnosing fetal sex.
Endocervical smear.--As early as the eighth week of gestation, chorionic villi are shed and excreted through the carvix. A smear of the cervix picks up these fetal cells which then may be analyzed without recourse to amniocentesis.

Based on a sample of 75 women, Phadke et al. (1979) found that fetal cells are sloughed off and that they could identify fetal sex by Barr body counts and Y-fluorescence with an error rate of 1.3 per cent in the former case and 2.7 per cent in the latter. While these are very promising findings, and should be replicated by others, there does not appear to be published any other study corroborating these findings. Given the dispersion of critical values from other sex diagnostic procedures, it seems prudent to wait until more studies have examined this procedure before recommending its use. It should be noted, however, that Y-fluorescence has been used to identify sex of other cell types with a 99 per cent accuracy (Paulson et al., 1976). We, therefore, strongly recommend additional experimentation with the endocervical smear procedure.
FSHfrom urineor maternalserum.-- In their study of FSH levels among 23 women, Kulin et al. (1979) found no significant difference in maternal urinary FSH between women with male and female fetuses.
Plasma or serum testosterone assay.--Several authors report studies of fetal sex determination from maternal blood samples. The results are not encouraging. Those researchers finding no significant differences by fetal sex include Dawood (1981), Dawood and Saxena (1977), and Glass and Klein (1981). Klinga et al. (1978) do report sex-related differences in serum peripheral testosterone. In a study of 180 women from whom samples were drawn at 7-20 weeks of pregnancy, the women with females had a significantly lower plasma testosterone level (mean of 597 ± 167 pg/ml) than those with males (828 ± 298 pg/ml). But owing to the wide scatters of individual scores, the authors

124 Findley, Potter, and Findley SocialBiology

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

were able to predict fetal sex accurately for only 28 per cent of the males and 5 per cent of the females.
Of the five nonamniotic-fluid procedures reviewed, only the endocervical smear meets useful standards of both reliability and timeliness. The problem is that there is only one study of this procedure. Until there are confirmations of the initial claims, we prefer to remain cautious. This leaves the amniotic fluid procedures.

ASSAYS OF AMNIOTIC FLUID

Radioimmunoassay of amniotic fluid lowers cost and results in less delay than karyotyping. Assay procedures are roughly half as expensive as karyotyping of cultured amniotic fluid cells if one counts in the expenses associated with the amniocentesis. Fees vary, of course, from place to place, but the following quoted from Providence, Rhode Island, presumably are fairly representative.

Expenses related to karyotyping:

amniocentesis (with ultra-sound) $218

chromosome analysis (karyotyping) .. 260

physician counseling (two visits)

100

The total comes to about $575. A radioimmunoassay of amniotic fluid testosterone costs $25, one-tenth the cost of karyotyping, but also incurs the cost of physician counseling ($100) and of amniocentesis ($220), giving a total of about $345, approximately 40 per cent less than the cost of karyotyping. A similar set of fees quoted for 196 genetic counseling centers in various parts of the United States proved slightly higher, but with a similar ratio of costs between karyotyping and radioimmunoassay of amniotic fluid (Myers, 1982).
While radioimmunoassay diagnoses are less costly, they are also less reliable than karyotyping. But this does not

foreclose their use, because karyotyping may be used as a follow-up for cases where radioimmunoassay is inconclusive. One need not do a second amniocentesis. Radioimmunoassay can be done very quickly and uses a very small amount of amniotic fluid, leaving a sufficient sample with which to begin the cell culture required for karyotyping immediately after the assay, if the assay results are inconclusive.
Radioimmunoassay procedures are used to diagnose fetal sex from amniotic fluid samples containing sex hormones released by the fetus. Commonly, the two hormones assayed are testosterone (T), a male sex hormone, and folliclestimulating hormone (FSH), a hormone excreted by the female reproductive system. High concentrations of testosterone in the amniotic fluid indicate a male fetus, while high concentrations of FSH indicate a female. Fetuses of both sexes excrete both sex hormones, but in varying amounts. Therefore, diagnosis is not simply determined from presence of one or the other hormone. For this reason, assay diagnoses are based on a range of testosterone or FSH values which span values found for 90-100 per cent of the male and female fetuses. Unfortunately, the male and female ranges of possible testosterone or FSH concentrations overlap, so radioimmunoassay diagnoses are not 100 per cent accurate.
A controversy surrounding radioimmunoassays of amniotic fluid is the need for chromotography. Some investigators insist on its necessity for best results (Diztler et al., 1979). However, more researchers waive it than employ it; and in the 13 studies whose results are enumerated in Table 1, there appears to be little connection between use of chromotography and the separation of values between male and female fetuses.

Perhaps more important is the gestational age at time of amniocentesis. Most studies do not consider timing of amniocentesis as an independent variable and lump subsamples whose range of gestational ages spans 4 to 6 weeks and sometimes more. A few report differences in amniotic fluid testosterone by gestational age and sex of the fetus. Three of these studies (Dodinval and Duvivier, 1980; Kunzig et al., 1977 and Zondek et al., 1977) report increases in male testosterone concentrations at least through weeks 15-16; but after that time results differ among the studies. Kunzig et al. (1977) report a significant drop in male testosterone af-

ter the twentieth week, with the decline commencing in the sixteenth week. Dodinval and Duvivier (1980) concur with this finding. Dawood and Saxena (1977), Dawood (1981), and Zondek et al. (1977) disagree, showing continued increases in male testosterone through the 20-24 week period. Belisle et al. (1977) find no correlation between testosterone levels and gestational age during weeks 14-20. On balance, the studies indicate a rise in male AFT through weeks 15-16 at least, so that assays performed at this time are likely to show the greatest difference between male and female testosterone levels.
Absolute male testosterone levels are

more variable from study to study. In addition to fetal age differences, this variability reflects the use of different radioimmunoassay kits which are sensitive to a variety of compounds immunologically related to testosterone. Jirasek (1980) directly compared two assay systems and found almost a two-fold difference in mean levels. However, the separation between male and female testosterone levels was less variable, as there was a concomitant increase in the standard deviation.
For these reasons, some of the radioimmunoassay procedures achieve greater precision in fetal sex diagnosis than others. We recommend that the particular laboratory techniques and antibodies adopted by researchers with high mean values and low standard deviations for mean male testosterone levels be investigated for subsequent refinement and development of a standardized fetal sex diagnosis protocol.
Mean testosterone values (T-value) together with associated standard deviations classified by fetal sex for 13 studies are collected into Table 1. Given as well are sample sizes, gestational age ranges, and use of chromotography. Despite the wide distributions of individual Tvalues, virtually all studies report a mean female value of 200 pg/ml or less and most studies report means of 100 or less. In contrast, the means reported for males are mainly 200 pg/ml and above.
Due to a strong positive skewness, the distribution of values associated with male fetuses generates a much larger standard deviation than do values associated with future daughters, which are much more peaked and less skewed in distribution. The magnitudes of standard deviation are sufficient to yield appreciable overlap between the two

sets of scores. These distributional characteristics argue against constructing confidence intervals for diagnosing male fetuses.
An alternative approach is to stipulate a single cutting point and for any value below or above it predict daughters and sons, respectively, inevitably with a certain amount of error. Belisle et al. (1977), claiming 96 per cent accuracy for male diagnoses and 94 per cent for females, proposed 240 as the appropriate criterion point. Using this value, Doran et al. (1980) found 91 per cent of values below 240 associated with females and 93 per cent of values above 240 with males. Thus, the single cutpoint of 240 could be adopted to determine fetal sex accurately for 92 per cent of all cases.
Thanks to such a large sample and the distributional detail given, the study of Doran et al. (1980) commands particular interest. In this investigation all values below 162 are associated with females and all values above 338 with males. However, 55 per cent of the 812 assays have scores lying between these cutoffs. Utilized as a screening device in a two-stage procedure, testosterone would yield a decisive diagnosis 45 per cent of the time; but 55 per cent of the time certain diagnosis would require subsequent karyotyping.
Radioimmunoassay can also be employed to measure the concentration in amniotic fluid of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Of 353 amniotic specimens assayed for FSH as well as for testosterone, Doran et al. (1980) found that all FSH values less than 7.6 were associated with males, while scores above 10.9 showed a monopoly of females. By coincidence, 55 per cent of the scores again fell in-between.

cuses on the upper range of the interval where male and female T/FSH ratios may overlap. The 95per cent confidence interval extends up to 2.61 for females, but because of the slight spread evidenced in the right tail of the distribution, 7 per cent of the female fetuses had ratios higher than this value. Similarly, 6 per cent of the males have values lower than 2.64 and would have been misdiagnosed.
Alternative strategies can be designed that would yield different degrees of diagnostic accuracy. If virtually 100per cent accuracy is required, the associated "certainty" strategy calls for backstopping with karyotyping any T/ FSH ratio within the overlap zone of 2.2 through 3.4. If a 5 per cent chance of error in diagnosis of females is tolerated, backstopping would be required for any T/FSH value between 2.61 and 3.4. If backstopping with karyotyping is only employed for ratios in this range, the diagnostic error is approximately equal at 6 per cent for males and females. If the risk of error is increased to 10 per cent for females, however, the cutpoint of

2.41 yields a more reliable diagnosis of male than female fetuses. Without any karyotyping to backstop diagnoses, this cutpoint of 2.41results in a 9 per cent error in diagnoses of female fetuses, but only 4 per cent for males. The cutpoint of 2.41 yields an average diagnostic error of 6.4 per cent for both sexes, the minimum average chance of error for use of T/FSH ratios without karyotyping. If this degree of error is not acceptable, only the 100 per cent certainty strategy of backstopping for any T/FSH value between 2.2 and 3.4 may be employed.
For couples who do not require a certain diagnosis, a combination of T and FSH values may be used to diagnose fetal sex. Depending on which test statistics are used, couples may choose to risk 5 to 10per cent error in fetal sex diagnosis. Given the lower cost and lower maternal health risks associated with use of the assay procedures, this level of reliability may be acceptable to couples using fetal sex diagnosis and elective abortion to regulate the sex of their children.
Couples wishing to avoid male births at-risk for sex-linked diseases have two options. They may still use radioimmunoassay of testosterone and FSH, but using cutpoints where males arealways identified but some females are mistakenly identified as males. For example, the Doran et al. data suggest a cut point of 2.0 for T/FSH values. Any above this are taken to be male, but since 18 per cent of the female fetuses were associated with values of 2.1or more, some females would be mistakenly aborted. In exchange for this increased chance of aborting female fetuses, the earlier diagnosis permits a substantial reduction in maternal health risks. Alternatively, the couple may use karyotyping to verify any fetal sex diagnosis which falls within

the inconclusive gray zone for T, FSH, or T/FSH values. This would guarantee that no females are mistakenly aborted, but at a cost of greater expense and health risk.
NEED FOR VERIFICATION BY
KARYOTYPING
In the two-stage procedure where T values or else T/FSH ratios are acceptable alone only if deemed decisive and otherwise must be verified by karyotyping, how often must the double procedure be invoked? According to the results of Doran et al. (1980), it is about 55 and 20 per cent of the time, respectively. Let us translate these percentages into the risk of karyotyping expected by each individual for each regulated pregnancy. This conversion requires calculation of the probability distributions of numbers of karyotypings per regulated birth.
To keep the calculation simple, without serious distortion we can ignore the small number of favorable diagnoses that are followed by a subsequent late spontaneous abortion or still birth. Although the actual sex ratio may be closer to 105, let us also assume that the sex ratio is 100 so that the risk of having to interrupt deliberately a pregnancy on account of an unfavorable diagnosis is a constant 0.5 and therefore independent of fetal sex. Then, the expected number of diagnosed pregnancies per regulated birth is 2.0, implying 1.10 (2.0 times a 55 per cent backup rate) or 0.40 (2 times a backup rate of 0.20) karyotypings per regulated birth, dependent on whether T-values or T/FSH ratios are employed.
However, the dispersion around these expected values is appreciable. Suppose T-values are being employed. The probability of requiring h diagnosed pregnancies because the h-\ such preg-

nancies represent the wrong fetal sex while the hth pregnancy is of the sex desired is, under our simplifying assumptions, (0.5)A-J (0.5) = (0.5)*. Given h pregnancies required, the conditional probability of having to backstop with i karyotypings becomes (J) (0.55)' (0.45)ft~S valid for i = 0, 1, . . ., h, since 0.55 is the risk per diagnosed pregnancy of needing karyotyping while 0.45 represents the complementary probability of not needing it. The absolute probability P(j) of requiring; karyotypings is a sum of joint probabilities, namely, the joint probabilities of requiring h pregnancies of which / call for karyotyping. The number of pregnancies h for; karyotypings must be at least; but may be higher. Thus,
P(j) = 2 (0.5)h(f) (0.55)1 (0.45)"-'.
Based on this formula, the probabilities of requiring 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 or more karyotypings turn out to be 0.29, 0.46,0.16,0.06,0.02, and 0.01.The modal experience is one karyotyping. Three per cent will be unlucky enough to require four or more in order to achieve one birth of the desired sex. Only 29 per cent escape karyotyping altogether.
A much more favorable picture is seen when T/FSH ratios are used in place of T values. Then the risk of requiring a karyotyping per diagnosed pregnancy is reduced from 0.55 to 0.20 while the complementary probability of escaping karyotyping per pregnancy is raised from 0.45 to 0.80. Making these substitutions in the formulas above we findthat the probabilities of 0,1,2,3,4, and 5 or more karyotypings are now 0.67, 0.28, 0.05, 0.01, 0.00, and 0.00.

The modal experience is now no karyotyping. Under 10 per cent require two or more karyotypings.
Obviously the latter set of probabilities presents a much more favorable picture. The effect of ignoring late spontaneous terminations of favorably diagnosed pregnancies is to underestimate slightly both the mean and dispersion of numbers of karyotypings. The fact that the true sex ratio slightly favors males means that the quest for a daughter slightly inflates the average frequency and dispersion of karyotypings as compared to seeking a son. An important fact, however, is that the number of karyotypings per regulated birth can be expected to vary substantially from woman to woman as a function of chance.
SEX PRESELECTION STRATEGIES
In this section of the paper we focus on the use of radioimmunoassay to diagnose fetal sex for purposes of regulating the sex composition of offspring. Previous work (Kobrin and Potter, forthcoming) has presented estimates of the numbers of diagnoses and elective abortions required to achieve alternative compositional goals when sex diagnosis is 100per cent reliable. When the couple want to dictate the order of arrival of sons and daughters as well as their composition, obviously they must regulate the sex of each child. If they are indifferent about the order of arrival, then given 100 per cent reliable diagnoses, they may attain their compositional goal while waiving sex control efforts until such time as only sons or only daughters remain outstanding. The former strategy which controls the sex of all off-

spring may be labeled the abortionmaximizing or A-max strategy. The opposite strategy of least control compatible with a compositional goal will be called A-min since it is expressly designed to minimize the numbers of diagnoses and abortions. We now extend previous analysis to reflect the fallible and unequal reliabilities of diagnosis which accompany the use of T, FSH, or T/FSH values without verification by karyotyping. It turns out that there is a third strategy which is intermediate between the A-min and A-max decision rules in its demands for diagnosis and corrective abortion but which under certain conditions equals the efficiency of A-max strategy.
As the couple has successive births, the residual composition of their children still wanted is changing. At some point, sooner or later, it becomes singlesex, with one or more children outstanding belonging to a single sex. Let us call this residual composition, the "singlesex outstanding residual composition," or "SS-residual" for short. Whenever all outstanding children are of a single sex, every subsequent pregnancy must be regulated, that is, diagnosed for fetal sex and aborted if the diagnosis is adverse.
The probability of attaining a sex compositional goal under fallible diagnosis is sensitive to the number of children outstanding in the single sex residual. The higher the number, the less likely the couple is to achieve its goal if diagnostic procedures are not 100 per cent accurate. Moreover, if diagnostic reliability varies as a function of the true sex of the fetus, then the proportion succeeding is also sensitive to how often the single sex residual represents the sex that is more reliably diagnosed. If male diagnoses are more reliable and males

are also more likely, the failure rate is lower if males are the sex of the single sex residual.
That strategy which aims at reducing the desired number of children remaining when they are all of one sex will entail more diagnosis and abortion than an A-min policy but less than the A-max decision rule. Essentially, this new rule, which we call the moderate control or A-mod strategy, enjoins diagnostic and control efforts whenever the number of boys and girls outstanding are unequal. The intent is to keep the residual numbers of sons and daughters within one of each other so as to insure, as far aspossible, that when the SS-residual is reached the number of outstanding births is only one.
It turns out that the A-max strategy, with sex control efforts applied to every pregnancy, is necessary if one wishes both to minimize the size of the SSresidual and to maximize chances that the sex it represents is the more reliably diagnosed one. Even when the outstanding numbers of sons and daughters are equal, the couple must try to have the next child representing that sex which is the less reliably diagnosed so that they are left with an extra outstanding member of the sex which is more reliably diagnosed.
In sum, if diagnostic reliability is fallible and unequal for the two fetal sexes, A-max strategy must be practiced to maximize the probability of successfully achieving the compositional goal. If diagnostic reliabilities are fallible but equal and therefore independent of fetal sex, the A-mod strategy will reduce diagnostic and abortion loads relative to A-max strategy while yielding the same probability of success. The least diagnostic and abortion load is associated

with the A-min strategy, but without controlling the numbers or sex of the single sex-residual, it is also likely to have a higher chance of failure. In the next section we will explore the implications of adopting these alternative strategies for all family compositional goals with four or fewer children.
RELATIVE EFFICIENCIES OF THE STRATEGIES
A central question that physicians and couples must answer before adopting any one of these strategies is how much risk are they willing to undertake in order to achieve the couple's family compositional goals. Although the diagnostic procedures are fairly low-risk, elective abortion may not be. We have shown that the health risk can be reduced by adopting the radioimmunoassay procedures which enable earlier diagnosis, but this is at a cost of fallible diagnosis and a chance of failure to attain a desired compositional goal. For any bisexual compositional goal, the couple may opt for stricter control, at a greater health risk to the mother, or less stringent control, at a greater chance of failure to obtain the desired goal. In this section we examine the relative costs and risks associated with adopting the A-min, A-mod, or A-max strategies. The real issue is whether the A-mod strategy, much less the A-max strategy, increases the probability of success enough to justify the considerably heavier diagnostic and abortion loads necessitated by the increased control.
To answer the question, we employ an extension of the analysis found in Kobrin and Potter (forthcoming) to evaluate the average outcomes of A-min, Amod, and A-max for all bisexual

132 Findley, Potter, and Findley Social Biology

compositional goals comprised of four children or less, conditional on two levels of diagnostic reliability: (i) 0.90 for all diagnoses, and (ii) 0.90 for female diagnoses and 0.95 for male. Case (i) somewhat exaggerates the unreliability reported for the T values of the Doran et al. (1980) sample, whereas Case (ii) slightly exaggerates the sex dependent inequalities of unreliability reported with use of the T/FSH ratio. We are intentionally conservative in our assumptions, not wishing to overstate the reductions in diagnostic cost or burden enabled by use of RIA procedures. In this section the analysis scheme is briefly described; results are covered in the next section.
Several simplifying assumptions are necessary for convenient analysis. They are:
1. Each diagnosis of fetal sex is interpretable and of the reliabilities specified.
2. Risks of "early" and "late" spontaneous abortion (i.e., before and after the time of amniocentesis) are constant among women and over the histories of individual women. Given that these diagnoses are done during weeks 15-16 and any corrective abortions by week 20, these spontaneous abortion risks are 0.15 and 0.02, respectively.
3. The fetal sex ratio at time of diagnosis equals 105,identical to the sex ratio at birth. This is equivalent to male and female proportions of 0.512 and 0.488.
4. Plural births are insignificant in number.
5. Compositional goals remain fixed and couples attempt to realize them regardless of intermediate outcomes including number of elective abortions or delays between births.
6. Couples are able to have as many pregnancies as are demanded by the conjunction of their compositional goal, their chosen strategy, and diagnostic outcomes.
Justifications for assumptions 1, 3,
and 4 are cited in Kobrin and Potter

(forthcoming) and for assumption 2 in Bongaarts and Potter (forthcoming). Clearly assumptions 5 and 6 are unrealistic; but the intent is not plausible predictions of behavior, but rather to explore consequences, were couples to persist with and be physiologically able to follow through with stated sex compositional goals regardless of diagnostic and abortion demands encountered along the way.
To illustrate the method of analysis, let us assume that the reliability of a daughter diagnosis is 0.90, that of a son diagnosis, 0.95 (Case ii). Suppose further that the compositional goal is one boy and one girl. Under the A-min strategy control efforts are waived until after the first birth, the probability of the first born being a boy is 0.512 and given that event, the probability of manipulating affairs so that the second child is a girl is 0.90. Correspondingly, the likelihood of first a girl and then a boy is (0.488) (0.950). Taken over these two familybuilding paths, the probability of realizing the compositional goal is P = (0.512) (0.900) + (0.488) (0.950) = 0.924. For either family-building path, the size of the SS-residual is 1.0; hence, the mean size of the SS-residual is 1.0. The number of regulated births, that is, births for which control efforts have to be undertaken, is 1.0 for both paths and therefore the overall average number of regulated births, R, is 1.0. As a final statistic, the proportion male of the SSresidual's, M, coinciding with the more reliably diagnosed male sex, is 0.488. This is the probability of having a girl first, which leaves an SS-residual consisting of a single male.
In the present case, the A-mod strategy is one and the same as A-min strategy since the couple starts with the same number of outstanding sons and daugh-

ters, namely one, thereby justifying forswearing control efforts until after the first birth. However, under the A-max decision rule, an effort is made to have the first child a girl so as to maximize chances that the SS-residual will reduce to a single male child, that being the sex more reliably diagnosed. Because it is regulated, the first birth has a probability of 0.90 of being a girl and 0.10 of being a boy. The second birth also has to be regulated in order best to assure that its sex will be opposite to that of thefirst born. Accordingly, the family-building path of a girl and then boy has probability (0.90) (0.95); that of boy followed by girl a probability of (0.10) (0.90). Consequently the expected proportion realizing their compositional goal is P = (0.90) (0.95) + (0.10) (0.90) = 0.945. The average size of the SS-residuals is again 1.0; the expected number of regulated births is 2.0. The reward for this doubled load of diagnosis and selective abortion is a probability of achieving the compositional goal of one boy and one girl that has increased from p = 0.924 under A-min or A-mod strategies to P = 0.945 under the A-max decision rule. The difference is made more apparent by considering failure proportions: 1-P = 0.055 under A-max, down from 1-P = 0.076 under A-min or A-mod.
When the compositional goal embraces three or four children, analysis is greatly facilitated by conceptualizing the birth sequences as a tree diagram whose nodes represent residual sex compositions after each birth and whose connecting lines feature branch probabilities. These branch probabilities multiplied together along each possible path of family-building yield a probability for that family history. Associated with each family history is an attained sex composition that either qualifies as suc-

cess or failure with respect to the compositional goal. Also associated with each family history is the number of births involving sex control efforts as well as the size and sex of the SSresidual.
Weighted averages taken over all possible histories yield the results of interest, namely the proportion, P, achieving their compositional goal, the mean size of SS-residuals, the mean number, R, of regulated births, and the proportion, M, of SS-residuals, i.e., of the more reliably diagnosed male sex. The mean number of diagnoses required is approximately 2R and the mean number of selective abortions is approximately R. (These two approximations assume a sex ratio of 100and ignore the possibility of a late spontaneous abortion following a favorable diagnosis). The estimates of SS-residual and M help to explain the higher or lower P values among the different strategies' pursuit of a common compositional goal.
Let us start with Case (i)for which reliabilities of son and daughter diagnoses are both 0.90. Only the A-min and Amod decision rules are relevant since Amax strategy demands more diagnoses and corrective abortions than A-mod but cannot raise the probability of achieving the compositional goal. The comparisons of A-min and A-mod strategies for several compositional goals are given in Table 3. The proportions failing under the A-min strategy more than double from 10 to 21 per cent as the number of children desired increases from 2 to 4, while failure rates remain fairly low for higher order compositional goals under the A-mod strategy.
Except for the BG goal (one boy and one girl wanted) when the two strategies are operationally the same, A-mod

maintains a lower failure proportion, F, than A-min, as seen from the first two columns. The reason, found by juxtaposing the next twocolumns, is a lower mean size of the SS-residual. When the SS-residual is 1.0, the risk of failure is only 0.10, whereas when the mean size is 2.0or3.0therisks of notachievingthe compositional goal climb to 1.0-0.92 = 0.19 and 1.0-0.93 = 0.271, respectively. Theprice paid for the lower failure proportions ishigher mean numbers of regulated births, R, this comparison being given in the last twocolumns.
Finally, we ask whether the A-mod strategy proportionately reduces the failure rate more than it proportionately increases the diagnostic and abortion loads, compared to the A-min strategy. To answer this question we calculate a relative efficiency ratio,
-min A-mod =
--min ^A--mod
^A-min
--mod **A--min
R A--min

Here the letters F and R signify proportions failing and mean numbers of regulated births, the subscripts identifying the decision rule. To be relatively efficient, there should be more reduction in the proportion failing than there are increases in the numbers of regulated births. If a shift to A-mod or A-max strategy provides a more than proportionate increase inthechance ofsuccess, given the augmented diagnostic and abortion loads, therelative efficiency ratio will take on values exceedingone.
It is seen from the first column of Table 4 that the A-mod strategy's costs of more abortions are offset by greater chances of success for families comprised of4 or more children astheasymmetry of the goal (i.e., BBBG or BGGG versus BBGG) is higher. Indeed, it is noteworthy that for the BBBG and BGGG goals, the proportionate reductions of failure proportions F are roughly the same as the proportionate augmentations of regulated births, R.
When son and daughter diagnoses differ in their reliabilities, the A-max strategy, where every birth is regulated, acquires practical interest. Consider now Case (ii) when the reliability of

plain the differences in failure proportions for the A-min, A-mod, and A-max strategies using unequal reliabilities of diagnosis are given in Table 5. Excepting the BG goal, the mean size of SSresidual is consistently lower for A-mod than for A-min, though the proportion male (M) of SS-residual is not always higher. Under A-max strategy, the mean size of the SS-residual is at least as low as that of A-mod while the proportion of male SS-residual is consistently appreciably higher. On the other side of the ledger, the last three columns of Table 5 document rapid increases in mean numbers of regulated births as one moves from A-min to A-mod to A-max decision rules. Clearly, the lower failure rate of the A-max strategy is achieved at a higher diagnostic and abortion load.
Again it is worth asking whether the reduction in proportion failing achieved by the A-mod over A-min strategy is as great as the corresponding increase in number of regulated births. The corresponding relative efficiency ratio also may be calculated for the A-max versus A-min decision rules. These results are found in the last two columns of Table 4. The efficiencies of A-mod or A-max over A-min, measured in this fashion, progressively increase as the number of children involved in the compositional goal increases and as more emphasis is placed on daughters, for a given number of children. The relative efficiency ratios show that for the BG and BBG goals the increased number of regulated births with the A-max strategy are not offset by sufficiently large decreases in the proportion failing. For the BGG goal, compared to the A-min strategy the relative efficiency of the A-mod strategy also exceeds that of the A-max strategy. For all other compositional goals, the A-max strategy scores higher in relative ef-

ficiency over the A-min rule than does the A-mod strategy.
Comparison of the relative efficiency ratios under conditions of equal and unequal diagnostic reliabilities shows that the unequal reliabilities (sons, 0.95; and daughters, 0.90) result in marked efficiency of the A-mod over A-min strategies only for compositional goals favoring girls, BGG and BGGG. For all other goals, the more efficient use of the A-mod strategy obtains if diagnostic reliabilities are equal, with no diagnostic improvement for males.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Determination of fetal sex early in pregnancy is of interest both for purposes of family planning and disease prevention. Currently, most diagnoses are performed by karyotyping of amnioticfluidsamples drawn early in the second trimester. While yielding virtually certain diagnoses, this procedure is both expensive and time consuming, resulting in the need for higher risk instillation-type abortions when the diagnosis is adverse. The objective of this paper has been to determine whether other techniques can be used to reliably diagnose fetal sex and, if so, explore the implications of their use for sex preselection strategies.
A review of the medical literature indicates that radioimmunoassay procedures meet the objectives of lower cost, earlier diagnosis, and reasonable reliability for diagnosing fetal sex. Amniotic fluid testosterone has been found in several studies to indicate fetal sex correctly roughly 90 per cent of the time, while the ratio of testosterone to folliclestimulating hormone yields a slightly higher reliability (94 per cent). Since the assay results can be known without the

delay involved in karyotyping, assay procedures usually permit use of the lower risk suction curretage or dilation and evacuation type abortion if the diagnosis is adverse. If radioimmunoassays are used instead of karyotyping, we estimate that for each diagnosis and elective abortion the net cost savings is about $600, while the maternal mortality risk is reduced by at least one-half.
If virtually error-free diagnosis of fetal sex is demanded, then radioimmunoassays of amnioticfluidcan be used as a screening device backstopped by karyotyping when the assay results are inconclusive. With little expense added and no extra time delay involved, T/ FSH ratios may be substituted for Tvalues and thereby appreciably reduce the proportion of times that backstopping by karyotyping is necessary. In the data of Doran et al., which has been accorded special attention in this paper, the reduction calculated is from 55 to 20 per cent. Even at 20 per cent, however, substantial variation in the number of karyotypings per regulated birth must be expected as a function of chance factors, in particular the variable number of adverse diagnoses which dictate additional pregnancies.
Not to backstop radioimmunoassays with karyotyping is to accept two kinds of risk: having a child of the unwanted sex or else accepting as valid an adverse but inaccurate diagnosis and thereupon deliberately interrupting a pregnancy representing the desired fetal sex. According to the experience of Doral et al., the magnitude of either risk is somewhat less than 0.10. It is worth remarking that if a particular one of these two risks but not the other is acceptable to the mother and her physician, then the expected number of backstopping karyotypings can be cut in half. For example, if the

woman and her medical advisor are willing to tolerate a modest risk of her having a baby of the unwanted sex, then any assay yielding a favorable diagnosis whether decisive or belonging to the overlap gray area is treated as though it were decisive and the pregnancy allowed to go to term. On the other hand, an assay yielding an adverse diagnosis, unless initially decisive, would be double-checked by means of karyotyping.
If radioimmunoassay is utilized without karyotyping, the risk of diagnostic error is several per cent, perhaps slightly under 0.10. Although cutpoints may be determined which result in more reliable diagnosis for one sex (male) than another, any diagnostic unreliability increases the chance of not having one's children represent a desired sex composition. Suppose a couple wants b boys and g girls, but does not care about the order of their arrival. Is it necessary for them to regulate the sex of all b + g children in order to maximize chances of attaining the desired sex composition, or can some lesser number of births be regulated without suffering a diminution of the probability of success? If the reliabilities of daughter and son diagnoses may be taken as equal, and there is presently no entirely decisive evidence to the contrary, we have shown that one can suspend control efforts whenever the numbers of sons and daughters outstanding is identical without penalizing chances of attaining one's desired sex composition. However, one cannot waive control efforts until only all boys or else all girls are outstanding without augmenting the risk of not attaining the desired composition. When the reliabilities of son and daughter diagnoses differ, and that sex which is more reliably diagnosed is known, then it is necessary
