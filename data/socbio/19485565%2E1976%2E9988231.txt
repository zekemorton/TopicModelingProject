ABSTRACT: Drawing upon data from the 1965 National Fertility Study, this paper attempts to categorize white wives by their form of childlessness. Three categories of childlessness emerge: Voluntary, Involuntary, and Temporary. The three types of childless wives are compared across a number of demographic, socioeconomic, marital, and religious characteristics. The Voluntarily and Involuntarily Childless wives are remarkably similar on most characteristics, and they differ significantly from the Temporarily Childless.

Childlessness is a phenomenon that has as if it only occurs involuntarily. Only a received limited attention in recent years few researchers allow for the possibility

have been inclined to view childlessness in light of these normative proscriptions. They have concluded almost as a matter of fact that few couples will choose to be without children. Martinson (1970, p. 314) notes that "the desire for children is nearly universal. Marriages childless by choice are practically nonexistent." Similarly, Bell (1971, p. 417) has observed that "the majority of childless couples are not that way by choice." In discussions of the attention given childlessness in recent family textbooks by Kephart (1966), Landis and Landis (1968), and Landis (1970), Veevers (1974, p. 306) noted that "an estimate of the incidence of childlessness is followed by a discussion of factors contributing to subfecundity and sterility, revealing an implicit assumption that fecundity problems are the only cause of childlessness, and that something should be done to help the childless couple."
Empirical data and estimates, however, do not support the suggested universality of involuntary childlessness. In Riser's study of New York City conducted in the late 1930's, he observed that although the major share of permanent childlessness "appeared to be largely an involuntary situation," some of the childlessness was likely not due to involuntary sterility and subfecundity (Riser, 1939, pp. 66-68). More recently, Veevers (1972) has evaluated the incidence of voluntary childlessness in Canada and has estimated that at least half of the childlessness occurring there among urban women 45 years of age and older may well have been voluntary. A similar conclusion was reached by Rao (1974) in an analysis of fertility data collected from Rhode Island women during the late 1960's. He estimated that among the childless women aged 30 to 49 living with their husbands, half of them are voluntarily childless.
In still another study, Waller et al. (1973) suggested that families without

children were comprised of couples who were biologically fertile and couples who were biologically or deliberately sterile. While the authors did not employ a voluntary-involuntary dichotomy in their conceptualization of childlessness, they were successful in demonstrating that childlessness is not solely the result of involuntary factors.
In addition, many are arguing that the 1960's have been a decade of change with respect to contraceptive technology, sexual and family norms, and female work patterns and preferences (Bumpass, 1973; Westoff, 1972; Presser and Bumpass, 1972; Jones and Westoff, 1972). It is claimed that these changes are beginning to make possible the eventual realization of equal opportunity between the sexes because nonfamilial roles for females are now becoming a realistic option. Bumpass (1973, p. 68) has written:
The potential for complete fertility control makes childbearing--when and if--a matter of choice in an ultimate sense that never before existed. For the first time motherhood itself is fully a matter for rational evaluation. Since i t . . . (no longer must) be rationalized because inevitable, costs as well as virtues must be weighed. . . . Obviously childbearing roles offer much that is rewarding, but these rewards are not likely to be experienced equally by all women. . . . Motherhood (has thus been placed) more squarely in competition with other social roles.
If the above arguments are true, they point to the increasing importance of voluntary childlessness. Further, given the earlier data and estimates concerning its incidence, it would appear that the phenomenon should be given more attention in demographic and social scientific research. However, except for two analyses by Gustavus and Henley (1971) and by Veevers (1974) to be discussed below, we know little about the characteristics of the voluntarily childless and the extent to

which they are similar to or different from the involuntarily childless.
In the next section of the paper, I draw on data from the 1965 National Fertility Study and attempt to identify the married women without children according to their form of childlessness. In a later section, these subgroups are compared with one another on a number of demographic, socioeconomic, marital, and religious characteristics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
SPECIFICATION OF THE CHILDLESS
SUBPOPULATIONS
The data employed in this investigation were taken from the 196S National Fertility Study, a nationally representative survey of the fertility behavior of married women conducted by Norman B. Ryder and Charles F. Westoff (see Ryder and Westoff, 1971). Respondents were drawn from an areal probability sample of married women under 55 years of age, born after July 1, 1910. Interviews were conducted for over 5,600 married women.

through the use of questionnaire items concerning ability to have children, intended family size, etc. It soon became apparent that in addition to the voluntarily and involuntarily childless, there existed a third group of childless wives: those who were temporarily childless for apparently voluntary reasons.
In defining these groups, I first referred to the questionnaire item concerning physical capability to bear children. If a woman reported having no children and was biologically incapable of having children, but was not voluntarily sterilized, she was classified as Involuntarily Childless. If a woman reported having no children, was biologically capable of having children, but did not intend to have any children, she was classified as Voluntarily Childless. As I noted, however, a category of childless wives remained: the woman who reported having no children, was biologically capable of having children, and who intended to have one or more children in the future. Women in this category were classified as Temporarily Voluntarily Childless.

family income, for the childless subgroups. In regard to husband's income, the Voluntarily and Involuntarily Childless wives are quite similar in their distributions. The Temporarily Childless are found predominantly in the categories of $5,000 through $11,999; there are fewer VOLS and INVOLS in these middle categories, with more of them at the upper and lower ends of the distributions.
For family income, the same patterns observed with husband's income are sustained. The Temporarily Childless are concentrated in the middle of the income distribution. The Voluntarily and Involuntarily Childless are found more often at the upper and lower ends of the dis-

pation (table not included). The TEMPS show a significantly larger proportion of professionals and a smaller proportion of managers than do the other two childless subgroups. The Temporarily Childless have relatively fewer husbands employed in clerical-sales than the other two subgroups, and uniformly low percentages are evidenced by all subgroups in the agricultural and military occupational categories. Again, however, the major differences occur between the Temporarily Childless and the Voluntarily and Involuntarily Childless.

between the various subgroups (see Table 4). A significantly smaller proportion of the Temporarily Childless received a grade-school education, and a significantly larger proportion received some college when compared to the other subgroups. The VOLS and INVOLS show roughly similar distributions, while the TEMPS are only similar to them in the high-school categories.
The distribution of the educationalattainment ofthe husbands shows some of the same trends, although not as marked as those exhibited by the respondents. The Temporarily Childless have husbands even more concentrated at the higher levels ofeducation than they themselves. And the VOLS and INVOLS are roughly

similar. The husbands (VOLS and INVOLS) tend to be similar at the two highest educational levels (high school andcollege), while thewives aremore heavily concentrated at the high-school level.
Marital and religious characteristics.--The first characteristic in this group to be examined is number of years married (see Table 5). As expected, the Temporarily Childless report, on the average, fewer years of marriage than either the Voluntarily or the Involuntarily Childless. In contrast, more than 38 percent of the VOLS, asagainst 22 per cent of the INVOLS and none of the TEMPS, have been married formore than twenty years.

the date of the interview. More than20 per cent of the Voluntarily Childless wives report no sexual intercourse, asagainst 8 per cent of the Involuntarily and Temporarily childless. Another finding isthe high percentage of "Don't know's" among both the VOLS (nearly 11 per cent) and the INVOLS (over 12per cent). Among the TEMPS, less than 6 percent have poor memories when recalling the frequency of sexual intercourse. Ontheaverage, the Voluntarily Childless participate in coitus less often than the other two subgroups; and the Temporarily Childless, more often. Onthis characteristic, clear differences exist among the three subgroups of childless wives.

Finally, religious preference for the groups of childless wives is reported in Table 7. Among the Voluntarily and Involuntarily Childless wives, more than 20 per cent are Catholics, whereas about 28 per cent ofthe Temporarily Childless are so classsified. Somewhat more of the VOLS are Baptists and Methodists than the INVOLS; in contrast, theINVOLS are more often Fundamentalist Protestant, and other Protestant, than are the Voluntarily Childless. As suggested by theGustavus and Henley (1971) study mentioned earlier, there is a slight tendency for the Voluntarily Childless to prefer either no affiliation or the more liberal denominations somewhat more frequently than the

Involuntarily Childless, although the differences are not great.
I have endeavored in this section to compare a series of demographic, socioeconomic, marital, and religious characteristics among groups of Voluntarily, Involuntarily, and Temporarily Childless wives. Although there are some important exceptions, Voluntarily and Involuntarily Childless wives are not markedly different from each other. The VOLS are considerably older than the INVOLS, but the two groups are not much different with respect to metropolitan versus nonmetropolitan residence, husband's income, and total family income. Further, the husband's occupational distributions, as well as educational attainment for husbands and respondents, are very similar for both groups of childless wives. The VOLS have been married considerably longer than the INVOLS and, on the average, engage in coitus less frequently. The religious preferences of the two groups are rather similar.
The Temporarily Childless, however, are quite dissimilar from the other two childless groups. The TEMPS on the average are in their 30's and rank high on most indicators of socioeconomic status. They report fewer years of marriage than either the VOLS or INVOLS and engage in coitus more often. These differences, however, may be due in part to their younger age.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Two major objectives characterize this investigation. I first attempted to categorize white wives by their form of childlessness. Drawing upon data from the 196S National Fertility Study and examining responses on questionnaire items identifying physical capacity for bearing children, current number of children, and intended family size, I differentiated three types of childlessness: Voluntary, Involun-

tary and Temporary. Certainly there are conceptual and methodological difficulties with these operational distinctions, and I have endeavored to indicate some of them. These categories and the strategies for identifying them are first approximations. Survey and interview data, particularly the latter, expressly developed for identifying categories of childlessness should be more successful in capturing its essential dimensions. Additional research with data similar to those developed and gathered by Veevers (1973) in her analysis of voluntary childlessness is needed for all forms of childlessness before we can pretend to possess an adequate understanding of the phenomenon.
The second objective was to compare the Voluntarily, Involuntarily, and Temporarily Childless wives across a number of demographic, socioeconomic, marital, and religious characteristics. From earlier analyses, especially those of Veevers (1973) and Gustavus and Henley (1971), I expected that the Voluntarily Childless would differ significantly from the Involuntarily Childless, particularly with respect to socioeconomic status, metropolitan residence, and religious preference. However, these hypotheses were not supported. Instead, the Voluntarily and Involuntarily Childless wives were remarkably similar across most characteristics, and both groups were very different from the Temporarily Childless.
In an attempt to assess these findings, several factors may be discussed. One concerns the Temporarily Childless. Although considerable differences exist between them and the other two childless subgroups, the small number of wives in this category (N = 36) should be taken into account before drawing inferences. Further, almost all of these wives are 30-to-39 years old and are thus considerably younger than wives in the other two childless subgroups. To a certain extent, some
