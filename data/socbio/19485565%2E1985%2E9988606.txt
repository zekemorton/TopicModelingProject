ABSTRACT: Human responses to alcohol--especially sensitivity and acute behavioral tolerance--are being studied within a behavioral genetic design involving comparisons of scores from monozygotic twins, dizygotic twins, nontwin siblings, and unrelated (adoptee) pairs reared in the same family from infancy. The planned genetic analyses must await completion of data collection. The present sample is, however, adequate for analyses of means and for some analyses of individual differences in responses. For most of the measures being used, we find the usual mean decrement in performance after alcohol dosing to 0.100 BAC, but individual differences in response to alcohol are large, and a few individuals actually improve in performance after dosing. Also, on two tests, Cancellation and Block Rotations, there is a significant mean improvement in performance immediately after dosing. As yet we do not have a satisfactory explanation for this phenomenon. On most but not all of the tests, performance improves after the initial decrement during a 3-hour period in which blood alcohol levels are maintained by additional hourly doses. This improvement may be due in part to practice effects, as well as to the development of acute behavioral tolerance to ethanol (ABTE). We are still exploring ways in which these effects may be disentangled, using data from concurrent placebo control subjects and from pre-dosing test sessions. It is already apparent, nevertheless, that most of the variability in sensitivity and ABTE is related to pre-existing individual variability rather than to gender, age, height, weight, or drinking history. By mailing annual questionnaires to all participants, we hope to be able to test the hypothesis that those who were relatively insensitive to ethanol or who showed a relatively large amount of ABTE during the test sessions may be at increased risk for heavy alcohol consumption.

Although individual differences in responses to alcohol were noted in early research (e.g., Jellinek and McFarland, 1940), the dozens of studies conducted during the past two decades have focused on the average impairment produced by alcohol. For obvious reasons, some studies have attempted to identify the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) required to produce significant mean effects (e.g., Donovan et al., 1983), and other studies have considered the types of processes most affected on the average by alcohol (e.g., Mills and Bixgrove, 1983).

Our perspective as behavioral geneticists led us to focus on individual differences in responses to alcohol rather than average performance for several reasons: (1) For mice, men, and fruit flies, genetic variation among individuals is ubiquitous. At least half of all loci are significantly polymorphic for each species. (2) Genetic variability among individuals relates to observed variability among individuals for a wide range of biobehavioral characteristics. Thus, genetic variation among individuals is likely to be an important source of individuals' responses to alcohol as well. (3)

Clearly, alcohol abuse is one of the greatest problems in our society today. Surveys consistently find that 10per cent of adult Americans who drink experience alcohol-related problems. Behavioral genetic studies suggest that heredity plays a major role in predisposing individuals toward alcohol abuse: With a singlefirst-degreerelative who is alcoholic, one's risk of becoming an alcoholic is about 1in 5. Furthermore, adoption studies suggest that this risk is the same even when an individual is adopted away from the alcoholic relative at birth, a finding that strongly implicates genetic factors in alcohol abuse (e.g., DeFries and Plomin, 1978).
The Colorado Alcohol Research on Twins and Adoptees (CARTA) is a prospective study of alcohol abuse in a large population of social drinkers who are members of familial pairs useful for quantitative genetic analysis: identical twins, fraternal twins, nontwin siblings, and adoptees. The focus of CARTA is the description and explanation of individual differences in responses to ad-

dependent of sensitivity, quickly develop acute tolerance are more likely to be at risk for alcohol abuse simply because such individuals are likely to consume more alcohol than individuals who are sensitive to the initial effects of alcohol and those who do not develop acute tolerance. This hypothesis fits the prevailing view that genetic influence on alcohol abuse does not involve genes that push an individual to abuse alcohol. Rather, genetic variability results in some individuals not having the normal curbs on drinking. Genetic influence on alcohol abuse may not be as much a matter of a larger engine driving some individuals to drink as it as a matter of weaker brakes for stopping. The importance of finding such risk factors lies in the great cost of alcohol abuse to our society--estimated to be far greater than the costs of cancer--coupled with the one sure finding from treatment research which indicates that alcohol abuse is treated best when it is treated early, before the social supports of family and occupation dissolve.

lationships using the techniques of quantitative genetics. Our previous study in this area involved 29 brother pairs in Hawaii (Wilson et al., 1983; Wilson et al., 1984). Two doses of ethanol were administered; the first dose (0.8 g/kg) was designed to yield a BAC of 0.100 g/dl. A half-hour battery of tests was administered three times prior to consumption of alcohol (to establish base performance) and three times at hourly intervals during the 3-4 hours while each subject's BAC as assessed by an intoximeter declined to 50 per cent of its peak value. At that time, another dose of ethanol was administered (45 per cent of the initial dosage) and the test battery was presented three more times. A broad range of tasks was employed: gross motor tasks such as rail walking and body sway, simple perceptual speed measures such as reaction time and cancellation, hand-eye coordination measures such as pursuit rotor and dowel balancing, and measures further downstream in the cognitive processingflowof information such as spatial tasks and those that require logic. We also used an electronic video game as a measure of general functioning.
In that preliminary study, the measures were reasonably reliable, and data for control subjects for whom a small amount of ethanol (about 3-4 ml) was floated on top of their otherwise alcohol-free drink indicate that performance of sober subjects remained largely unchanged during the repeated testing. One particularly interesting findingwas that the slope of the linear portion of the alcohol clearance curve was found to decline more steeply after the second dose of alcohol, a reliable phenomenon which we labeled Acute Metabolic Tolerance to Ethanol

(AMTE; Wilson et al., 1984). In addition, for most measures, significant decrements in performance were observed on the average immediately following consumption of the first dose of alcohol. One novel result concerns acute tolerance: After the second dose of alcohol, performance was little impaired on average even though BAC was approximately at the same moderate level. Most impressive, however, was the wide range of reliable individual differences for both sensitivity and acute tolerance.
The small number of sibling pairs did not yield much power to detect familial resemblance for sensitivity and acute tolerance. However, some familiality was found. A preliminary report of an Australian twin study suggests that initial responses to alcohol are likely to be influenced by genetic factors (Martin, 1983). The Australian study was much like the first part of our Hawaiian study in that a single dose of alcohol was administered and then reaction time, coordination, and steadiness were measured. Significant genetic influence on psychomotor performance following alcohol consumption was found. Interestingly, the increase in variance of performance often noted following alcohol consumption appears to be genetic in origin.
Our preliminary Hawaiian study and the Australian study gave us the confidence needed to undertake CARTA, a prospective, quantitative genetic study of 450 individuals, each tested for a 12hour session. CARTA will eventually include 50 pairs each of identical twins and fraternal twins (to assess genetic influence), nontwin siblings (to explore the possibility that twins share more similar family environments than do nontwin siblings), and adoptees (to as-

sess directly the influence of shared family environment). Other differences between CARTA and our first study include the use of a somewhat broader battery of tests and the inclusion of females as well as males. As described later, the test battery includes additional measures such as measures of information processing and evoked potentials. Females are included for two reasons. First, nearly all studies of the effects of alcohol are limited to males, and we need to learn more about alcohol's effects on females. Secondly, our questionnaire studies and data presented in this article indicate that, once gender differences in body weight are controlled, there are no important gender differences in alcohol consumption or in responses to administered alcohol.
Another difference between CARTA and our earlier research involves an attempt to bring our laboratory administration of alcohol one step closer to drinking outside the laboratory. Administering a single dose of alcohol as in nearly all previous studies of the effects of alcohol, or even administering two doses as in our Hawaiian study, leads to a roller coaster pattern of BAC which does not typify normal drinking patterns. A large dose is also administered initially in CARTA. However, several smaller doses are then administered in an attempt maintain BAC at approximately 0.100 g/dl for 3 hours. This procedure provides a cleaner test of acute tolerance, and it also approximates normal drinking patterns to a greater extent than do the single-dose studies.
This paper will focus on individual differences in sensitivity and acute tolerance. Although we predict that genetic variability will account substantially for

these differences in responses to alcohol, quantitative genetic analysis must await the testing of approximately three times as many subjects. We expect to complete testing in'about three years. The prediction of alcohol abuse from individual differences in sensitivity and acute tolerance provides the foundation for these later analyses and also leads to an interesting story in itself, one rife with social implications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
SUBJECTS
The subjects for this report were 23 men and 30 women between the ages of 21 and 55 who had volunteered to participate in the Colorado Alcohol Research on Twins and Adoptees (CARTA). In the preliminary screening all had confirmed that they had used alcohol but denied that they had any problems associated with alcohol use; would not take any medications or drugs (with the exception of nicotine) for at least 12 hours before testing; were taking no medications or drugs that would contraindícate the use of alcohol; had no medical problems such as diabetes that would preclude their taking alcohol; and, in the case of women, were not pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Each subject was also a member of a pair of monozygotic twins, dyzygotic twins, or nontwin siblings, or a member of an adopted/biological offspring pair reared in the same family from infancy (less than 12 months of age). These relationships are required for the behavioral genetic analyses which will be conducted when the group numbers are adequate, but are not further discussed here. Each subject agreed to report for testing at

0800 hours without having taken any food or drink (except water) or drugs (except nicotine) since dinner the previous evening. Subjects were tested individually and were paid as partial compensation for their assistance.
PROCEDURES
A personal history and alcohol use questionnaire had been mailed to each subject and, in most cases, the subject reported for testing with the completed questionnaire. In a few cases a subject forgot to bring the questionnaire, but agreed to mail it in, or filled out another. During the preliminary interview at about 0800 hours, the subject was interviewed to confirm absence of any contraindications to dosing with alcohol, to insure an adequate understanding of the procedures to be used (for informed consent), to confirm that he/she had followed the fasting instructions, and to obtain a short pedigree. A breath alcohol test was then conducted; no subjects showed any trace of alcohol. Next, the subject was measured for height and weight and was given a vocabulary test and Raven's Progressive Matrices test, with the instructions that he/she should take the time needed to try to get each item correct (untimed, power tests). The purpose of these tests was to estimate subject's IQ. During the vocabulary test, the subject was given a small standard breakfast of two pieces of whole wheat toast, 6 ounces of orange juice, and 8 ounces of skim milk.
Baseline (pre-alcohol) performance was then assessed by administering a standard 30-minute test battery three times (Pre-1, Pre-2, Pre-3). The Pre-1 test battery typically took more than 30 minutes for completion, as each test was explained thoroughly before it was

given. The use of three preliminary testing sessions before alcohol dosage represents a compromise. Since the intent during this phase is to measure base level responses or capability for each person, it would perhaps be better to continue preliminary testing until practice effects are no longer evident. However, this would mean a variable (and, perhaps, large) number of sessions for each subject and would very likely be self-defeating in that some subjects would become too fatigued or bored to continue with the alcohol sessions. The adoption of the three-session paradigm seems to be working reasonably well, as estimates of practice effects are generally small, as described later. The tests that comprise the battery are described below.
ALCOHOL DOSAGE
With the goal of achieving a blood alcohol concentration of 0.100 g/dl, the subject was weighed, and an amount of USP grade 95 per cent ethanol was measured out, based on the formula 0.8 grams of absolute ethanol per kilogram body weight. The ethanol dose was then mixed with a volume (about 450 ml) of a sugar- and caffeine-free soft drink seven times the volume of the ethanol, and divided into 10 small cups. The subject was instructed to drink one small cupful every 1.5 minutes, so that the full dose would be taken within 15 minutes. In a few cases a subject expressed dislike for sugar-free drinks, and was offered the choice of carbonated water for dilution of the ethanol. After taking the ethanol dose, the subject was instructed to rise out his/her mouth several times with tap water to eliminate ethanol from the teeth and oral mucosa. After an initial absorption period of 10 minutes, a

breath alcohol reading (BrAC) was taken, and subsequent readings were obtained every 10 minutes for 3 hours using an Iatoxilyzer (Omicron Systems Corporation). The test battery (Post-1) was given during the 10- to 40-minute portion of the hour after initial alcohol dosing, during the ascending limb of the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) curve.
With the goal of maintaining BAC at about 0.100 g/dl, supplemental doses of ethanol were given, based on the following criteria: If, at the end of thefirsthour after initial dosing, the BrAC was below 70 per cent of the peak value after the initial dose, a supplemental dose of ethanol equal to 30 per cent of the original dose was given. If BrAC wasbetween 71 per cent and 85per cent, the supplement was 20 per cent of the initial dose. If BrAC was between 86 per cent and 100 per cent, the supplement was 10 per cent. After the subject rinsed his/her mouth and teeth, the 30-minute test battery was given again (Post-2). At the end of 2 hours after the initial dose of alcohol, another supplementary dose was given in an analogous manner, and the test battery was repeated (Post-3). For most subjects (exceptions are noted below), these procedures resulted in maintenance of BrAC at or near 0.100 g/dl for 3 hours, thus allowing 3 hourly assessments of performance while at this BrAC. When BrAC had been reduced by metabolism to one-half the peak value achieved by each subject (about 5-6 hours after initial dosage for most subjects), another testing session (Post4) was conducted.
TEST BATTERY
The alcohol use questionnaire mentioned earlier is a lengthy questionnaire

developed as part of our previous research (Gabrielli and Plomin, 1985). Questions include how often beer, wine, and hard liquor were drunk during the past year and how much was usually consumed per session. For the purposes of this report, we used this information to estimates grams of ethanol consumed per month. During each of the 30minute test sessions, each subject (tested singly) completed the following tests in the order indicated:
1. Body temperature is taken by means of a quick reading thermometer covered by a thin film disposable cover. Systolic and diastolic bloodpressures are taken using a W. A. Baum, Inc. "Baumanometer" (sphygmomanometer). Heartrate is taken by counting the pulse at the wrist for 15 seconds.
2. Body sway is measured by having the subject stand facing a wall 15 cm away, with feet together and arms relaxed at the sides. The subject is instructed to relax, stand still, and avoid talking while a 30-second sample of body sway is taken: A video camera mounted about 1 meter overhead focuses on a 1.6-cm round paper cutout which has previously been pasted on top of the head. The subject is then instructed to continue standing still and close the eyes while a second 30-second videotaped sample is taken. At a convenient later time, eyes-openand eyesclosed body sway is estimated by playing the tape on a video monitor, drawing the movement of the paper spot on the monitor screen with a crayon, and then measuring the maximum fore and aft excursion and the maximum lateral excursion made during the time sample. These excursions are then summed, and the sum is corrected for focal length (focal length varies as a function of the

height of the subject, as the video camera is mounted from the ceiling and is fixed in place) for eyes-open and eyesclosed body sway measurements.
3. Hand steadiness is assessed by asking the subject to hold a thin (1.5-mm) metal probe within a small (4-mm) hole in a metal plate without letting the probe touch the sides of the hole. The subject is seated for this test and is not allowed to brace his/her hand, arm, or wrist on the table or with the other hand. Two 10-second trials are given. The score is the amount of time the probe is not in contact with the plate during the 20second test.
4. Memory for sequence is measured using Milton Bradley's "Simon" game apparatus. The subject repeats the increasingly longer light/tone sequences programmed on the machine until an error is made. The score is then the number of correct sequential choices made on the previous (correct) trial.
5. Trackingskill is assessed via use of a Lafayette Instrument Company pursuit rotor set at 45 rpm. The target is a 2cm metal disc, with its center offset 8 cm from the center of rotation. Time on target is measured during a 30-second time sample.
6. Visualacuity is measured by means of American Optical eye charts with a visual angle of 1 minute. Vision is assessed with both eyes together and with use of corrective lenses, if the subject wears these.
7. Six paper-and-pencil tests are given: (1) The Colorado Perceptual Speed Test (30 seconds; 18 items) has items consisting of a four-letter/number stimulus (e.g., pbqd) followed by four choices. Among the choices, one is exactly the same as the stimulus, while the other three are reordered. The task is to

circle the choice exactly like the stimulus and move on to the next item. Scores are total number correct and total number of errors of commission. (2) TheCancellationTest (60 seconds) has 280 dot sets. A dot set may include three, four, orfive dots. The task is to ignore three-dot sets, place a horizontal line through four-dot sets, and place a vertical line through five-dot sets. Scores are number correct and total errors of commission. (3) The Sentence Checking Test (30 seconds; 24 items) has items which have as a stimulus a simple logical phrase (e.g., "A not after B"). The task is to circle the correct answer from two choices (e.g., AB BA). Scores are number correct and total errors of commission. (4) The ETS CardRotations Test (60 seconds; 7 rows of 8 figures) has a line drawing of a relatively simple geometric figure which serves as a stimulus for each row. The row is then filled out with a random mix of the same figure in a rotated position or in a mirror-image rotated position. The task is to circle all figures which are only rotated and to avoid all mirror images. Scores are number correct and total errors of commission. (5) The Reaction Time--Written Test (30 seconds; 100 rows) has rows of blocks of four letters (e.g., N Z L A). Given a target letter as a starting instruction, the task is to circle the target letter in each block, working from top to bottom. Scores are number correct and total errors of commission. (6) The Shepard-Metzler Mental Rotations (Block Rotations) Test as modified by Vandenberg (Vandenberg and Kuse, 1978) is a fairly difficult 20item test of spatial ability. Each item consists of a stimulus, which is a twodimensional representation of threedimensional array of cubes, followed by two correct alternatives and two incor-

Our interest in the relationship between subjective perceptions of alcohol sensitivity and objective assessments of sensitivity (Gabrielli and Plomin, 1985) led us to include seven self-report questions relating to other possible effects of alcohol (flushing, dizziness, nausea, sleepy, uncoordinated, balance impaired, driving impaired).

CORTICAL EVOKED RESPONSES (CER)
On three occasions throughout the day, measurements are made of the cortical response evoked by an auditory stimulus (click), including the amount of cortical suppression that is achieved after repeated presentation of the click. Recordings from the vertex are monitored on an oscilloscope and recorded on an FM tape recorder for later power spectral analysis. CER is measured once prior to alcohol administration, between the Pre-2 and the Pre-3 test sessions; once during the 0.100 g/dl BAC period, between the Post-1 and Post-2 test sessions; and once just before the final test session (Post-4), when BAC

ANALYSES
Because many of the subjects appeared nervous or ill at ease during the Pre-1 test session, we used this session for becoming acquainted and for training rather than for analysis. For estimates of test reliability, we used the correlation between the Pre-2 and the Pre-3 test scores. For baseline performance (pre-alcohol) we used the mean of the Pre-2 and Pre-3 scores. Because of the different metrics employed in the various measures, we divided the Post-1 through Post-4 scores by the baseline score on each test for the purpose of graphical presentation of the mean effects of alcohol, so that the mean effect

(usually a decrement) could be seen as per cent change. For statistical assessments, we used the actual scores. For each test, sensitivity to alcohol was assessed by paired Mests between each Post-1 score and the relevant base score; tolerance (Acute Behavioral Tolerance to Ethanol, ABTE) was assessed byusing paired Mests to compare Post-3 scores with Post-1 scores. Other analytical procedures are outlined in the Results section.
Our 5-year testing goal for behavioral genetic analyses is 450 subjects. We are now in Year 2 of this study and 150individuals have been tested. Data from 78 of these have been coded, checked, and entered into computer files. When we examined the breath alcohol (BrAC) data from these 78 subjects, we noted that 10 had BrAC's lower than 0.073 g/ dl and 9 had BrAC's higher than 0.109 g/ dl averaged over the 18 BrAC measurements taken during the 3 hours when we attempted to maintain BrAC at 0.100g/ dl. This range represents ± 20 per cent of the overall mean BrAC obtained for the sample (0.091). Though these readings may be due to machine error (it is unlikely that our dosing procedure could have allowed this much variability), we decided that the conservative thing to do wasto exclude these subjects from the analyses. Six others were excluded because they became sick (in most cases, vomited) sometime during the testing day, so their data sets were incomplete. For the remaining 53, the data are relatively complete, except for an occasional apparatus malfunction.
RESULTS
TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY
Test-retest reliability (correlations between the Pre-2 and the Pre-3 test

scores), critical for the interpretation of individual differences data, are presented in Table 1. Although the interval between the test and retest was only about 40 minutes, these estimates of reliability are more conservative than the usual internal consistency estimates. The tests are reasonably reliable (the median correlation to 0.82), except for Simon and Body Sway--Eyes Open. The estimates for Block Rotations and for Card Rotations are rather low as well. The measurement unreliability of the Simon apparatus seems to be a result of the randomization routine which itincorporates as, with only four lights, the probability of a string with a same-light sequence (e.g., red red red red) is rather high, and occurrence of one of these same-light strings can make a trial far too easy. For Body Sway, Block Rotations, and Card Rotations, there maybe differential practice effects which lead to lowered reliability, although, as discussed later, this hypothesis does not

seem to be supported by our other analyses. On the whole, though, the battery seems to measure a broad array of functions rather accurately.
BREATH ALCOHOL ASSESSMENTS
As shown in Figure 1, the mean breath alcohol (BrAC) estimates of blood alcohol concentration are about 0.090 g/dl across the first three alcohol test sessions (Post-1 to Post-3), rather than 0.100 g/dl, as intended. However, the use of "topping up" doses appears to have been successful, in that the BrAC curve is quite flat across these 3 hours. The BrAC at Post-4 is, of course, about one-half the value for the other alcohol test sessions, as the Post-4 test session was started for each subject when his/

her BrAC had decreased to one-half the peak value seen after the initial alcohol dose. Individual differences in BrAC were substantial and are taken into account in later analyses.
AVERAGE SENSITIVITY
Figures 2-5 contain mean change scores (for total correct responses) on the various measures. For each subject, a change score was computed by dividing each Post-1 through Post-4 test score by the subject's pre-alcohol base score and multiplying by 100 to yield per cent change. The tests included in each figure are grouped for clarity of presentation, rather than by test order. The two body sway change functions are grouped with visual acuity and are plotted with an in-

Although it is not clear what represents a performance decrement for some of the physiological measures (e.g., blood pressure), for convenience these were plotted alongside the behavioral measures for which mean decrements are expected.
For many of the change functions in Figures 2-5, there is apparently an average deterioration or decrement in per-

formance immediately after the initial alcohol dose. Such decrements (or, at least, changes) are here used as measures of sensitivity to ethanol. Specifically, mean sensitivity was assessed statistically for each test or function via a paired i-test between the mean base score and the mean Post-1 score (twotailed test). These means, f-values, and p-values are shown in the left half of Table 2. For all measures except heart rate and visual acuity, Post-1 scores differed

significantly from base scores. Body temperature decreased, blood pressure increased, and most of the behavioral measures showed performance decrements; two measures, Cancellation and Block Rotations, showed significant improvement. The greatest decrements in performance at Post-1 emerged for Dowel Balance (33 per cent decrement), the body sway measures (28 per cent decrement for eyes-open and 37 per cent decrement for eyes-closed), Perceptual Speed (26 per cent decrement), and Rail Walking (24 per cent

decrement). These results suggest that the greatest mean effects of alcohol as measured during the initial sensitivity period involve gross motor functioning (body sway and rail walking) or eyehand coordination (dowel balance and perceptual speed).
AVERAGE ACUTETOLERANCE
Figures 2-5 also indicate that, on the average, acute tolerance occurs for several measures. For example, three of the measures that show the greatest sensitivity (Dowel Balance, Perceptual

Speed, and Rail Walking) at Post-1 show improved performance at Post-3. The body sway measures are an exception, however. For an assessment of mean acute behavioral tolerance (ABTE), scores obtained during the Post-3 testing session were contrasted to those from the Post-1 session by using paired Mests. The relevant means, f-

values, and p-values are shown in the right half of Table 2. It can be seen that, of the 15 measures that showed significant decrements at Post-1, 7 showed significant improvement from Post-1 to Post-3, which is our operational definition of acute tolerance.
Although these analyses focus on the three test sessions when BrAC was

Vol. 32,No.

maintained near 0.100 g/dl, it should be noted in Figures 2-5 that Post-4 scores--when BrAC had been reduced by metabolism to one-half the peak value for each subject--also provide support for ABTE. For most measures, Post-4 performance was at or even exceeded base performance, even though BrAC was nearly 0.050 g/dl.
It is interesting that the body sway measures are an exception to the general finding of ABTE because some version of this test is often used as a screening device by police. One complexity of interpretation as to tolerance effects is that practice effects and tolerance effects lead to improved performance while fatigue and boredom could lead to decrements in performance, and we do not yet know in detail how these factors interact. However, on the basis of placebo control data from our study in Hawaii, we can at least say that Body Sway--Eyes Closed showed no changes over 4 hours of testing in that study. Moreover, in the present study, no significant change in performance on the two body sway measures was observed from Pre-2 to Pre-3, again providing no evidence for the hypothesis of practice effects.
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
Both during testing and during the subsequent data analyses, it was evident that individual differences in responses were large, both for sensitivity and for acute tolerance. In Figure 6, we present the actual distribution of scores of the 53 subjects for two measures which showed large average sensitivity effects, Body Sway--Eyes Closed and Hand Steadiness. Some individuals show no decrement in performance after alcohol dosage; some show impairment; and a few (e.g., Subjects 21, 31, and 46 for the

body sway measure and Subjects 29 and 41 for hand steadiness) actually improve at Post-1. Similarly, as expected from the means analyses, some individuals show ABTE during the Post-3 testing as compared to their Post-1 scores; some show no change; and a few intolerant individuals show performance decrements (e.g., Subject 41 for measures of both body sway and hand steadiness).
In an attempt to understand the sources of the individual differences in Post-3 performance, we conducted a hierarchical multiple regression analysis for each measure. At step one, the regressions of Post-3 scores on sex, age, height, and weight were estimated; at step two, the effects of drinking history (as a measure of already developed tolerance to alcohol) were obtained; at step three, the Pre-2 scores were used to estimate the effects of pre-existing individual differences on Post-3 performance on the various tasks; at step four, the Pre-3 scores were used in an attempt to ascertain whether any additional preexisting individual differences in Post-3 performance can be predicted by Pre-3 scores after the variance due to Pre-2 scores is removed; at step five, the BrAC variation during Post-3 was used as a correlate in order to estimate the effects of the ± 20 per cent variation in BrAC readings to which this data set had been constrained (dosing error).
These estimates, together with an estimate of test unreliability obtained by subtracting test reliability from 1.0, are shown in Table 3. The medians reported in the last row are particularly informative: About 85 per cent of the total variance in the 19 measures can be explained. The median variance accounted for by the various effects is 11 per cent by gender, age, weight, and height (in the first step of the hierarchical mul-

tiple regression); 2 per cent by drinking history (step two); 35 per cent by preexisting individual differences in performance (steps three and four); and 1 per cent by dosing error (step five). Unreliability of measurement accounted for 18 per cent of the variance.
The variance accounted for by gender (4 per cent on the average) should not be interpreted as differences between males and females in their responses to alcohol. As emphasized later, the major influence on Post-3 scores is base performance; the variance explained by gender is primarily due to performance differences unrelated to alcohol. Few gender differences in sensitivity or tolerance were observed.

The effects of previous drinking history on Post-3 scores seem surprisingly small given the emphasis in the literature on chronic tolerance. It may be that tolerance effects in our rather young sample are indeed small. However, it must be remembered that those who reported alcohol-related problems in their lives had been screened out for ethical reasons. Thus, heavier drinkers who probably show more tolerance may be underrepresented.

dressed the issue of acute tolerance. It might also be more important societally because the typical social drinking occasion lasts for several hours; performance after 3 hours' consumption must surely be more applicable to performance outside the laboratory than is performance measured immediately following the consumption of four or five drinks in a 15-minute period.
DISCUSSION
The major message from these results is that variability among individuals in their responses to alcohol is far greater than any average effect. Three possible problems in our study--dosing inaccuracies, possible practice effects, and improvement in certain scores following consumption of alcohol--affect only analyses of means and thus do not alter this basic conclusion. Nonetheless, we shall examine these issues in greater detail.
DOSING INACCURACIES
With the intent of raising the blood alcohol concentration to 0.100 g/dl, we calculated the initial ethanol dose on the basis of 0.8 g/kg body weight. This may seem to imply an assumption that the Widmark r for each person was equal to 0.8. Since the average Widmark r is about 0.65 or 0.7, the use of a 0.8 g/kg dose would seem to be too high. Yet, this dose works in practice, probably because some metabolic clearance of the ethanol is achieved during the absorption phase. The individual differences in the Widmark r and, probably, in speed of absorption represent a stickier problem, as they lead to BACs different from 0.100 g/dl. To achieve a relatively homogeneous data set for the present

analyses, we excluded data from subjects whose BAC estimates differed by more than 20 per cent from the mean BrAC measure (0.091 g/dl). The temporary loss of these data seems mandated by the logic underlying the analyses reported above, as we had not undertaken to manipulate BAC levels beyond the 0.0 (pre-alcohol) to 0.100 g/dl comparison. The remaining variation in BrAC readings was used as a covariate (dosing error) in the multiple regression analyses and accounted for only 1 per cent of Post-3 performance variance. The mean BrAC measure may be accurate, or, more likely, may be an underestimate, as the Intoxilyzer machine has been reported to yield readings which are about 0.005 g/dl too low (O'Neill et al., 1983). Despite these procedural difficulties, subjects were, on the average, maintained at about the same BAC across the 3 hours of alcohol testing, as is required to assess ABTE.
PRACTICE EFFECTS
We first considered average effects of alcohol--sensitivity immediately following alcohol consumption (measured by the difference between base performance and Post-1 scores) and acute tolerance or ABTE (measured by the difference between Post-3 scores and Post-1 scores). Interpretation of mean effects is aided by knowledge concerning practice effects, fatigue, and expectancy which can be obtained by testing placebo control subjects. We are currently collecting data for placebo control individuals by floating a small amount (about 3-4 ml) of ethanol on top of their cocktail. Although our current sample of control subjects is not yet large enough for analysis, our previous study in Hawaii (Wilson et al., 1984) showed relatively

Vol. 32, No. 3-4

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

flatperformance curves for control subjects on similar measures, thus suggesting that the combined effects of practice and fatigue were balanced reasonably well by our procedure. The present data can be used to provide some information relevant to practice effects by comparing scores for Pre-2 and Pre-3, the pre-alcohol performance trials which were averaged to construct our index of base performance. For 14of the 19comparisons, no differences were observed between Pre-2 and Pre-3 scores, suggesting that practice effects are unlikely to interfere with our analyses of average sensitivity and acute tolerance.
IMPROVED PERFORMANCE AFTER
ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION
Broadly speaking, sensitivity may be defined as any significant change in performance after administration of alcohol (or any drug). In this sense, all tests save one reveal significant meanchanges indicating sensitivity. Even the exception, visual acuity, shows a trend for a performance change. It is probably more common to restrict the use of pharmacological term, "sensitivity" to alcohol, to those instances in which a significant behavioral decrement is found. In this sense also, most of the tests in the battery reveal mean sensitivity effects, i.e., mean behavioral decrements during the Post-1 testing session. The exceptions include the blood pressure measurements, Cancellation, and Block Rotations. The rise in both diastolic and systolic blood pressure may also represent a decrement in function, so these may not be exceptions. The rise in the mean scores on Cancellation and Block Rotations might represent a practice effect, an exuberance effect, or both. In the Hawaiian study, Cancel-

lation was used and showed no change for placebo control subjects. However, in that study, Cancellation showed only a return to base performance an hour after consumption of alcohol, not the 10to 20 per cent improvement beyond base performance as seen in the present study. Also, Cancellation is a test of perceptual speed and our other measures of perceptual speed show the more typical pattern of mean decrements. Furthermore, Cancellation was one of the few tests that showed a practice effect from Pre-2 to Pre-3; thus, for now, we assume that the improved performance on the Cancellation test under the influence of alcohol is a practice effect.
An interesting possibility emerges concerning Block Rotations, which is a measure of spatial ability. No suggestion of practice effects emerged either in the Hawaiian study or in the present comparisons between Pre-2 and Pre-3 scores. We suggest that the rise in the Block Rotations scores following consumption of alcohol might represent a switch in cortical function to the (usually) subordinate right hemisphere, as a function of alcohol suppression of the left hemisphere. This latter possibility was posed before on the basis of results of our Hawaiian study (e.g., Wilson et al., 1984). In that study, another spatial test, Card Rotations, showed significantly higher scores for the alcohol subjects than for the placebo control subjects. Although we are not yet able to report results for control subjects, the present results for Card Rotations are similar in that the Post-2 average score is about 10 per cent above base performance and the Post-3 mean is the same as the base performance. We incorporated the more difficult Block Rotations test of spatial ability into the present study in

order to explore this finding further, and the results to date appear promising.
INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES
The most striking aspect of the data is the importance of individual differences, as shown in Figure 6. Most notably, a few people performed as well after alcohol dosage as they had during baseline testing. It should be noted that our results are in accord with those of many other studies in showing statistically significant average effects of alcohol; however, the alcohol effect does not explain much variance. That is, individual differences in response to alcohol outweigh the average effect of alcohol. Many studies do not report data needed to estimate precisely the extent to which the average effect of alcohol accounts for individual differences in performance, although our rough estimates are that these other data generally agree with our conclusions about the importance of individual differences. Consider, for example, a recent report on the effects of alcohol (Mills and Bixgrove, 1983). As in nearly all such studies, a single dose was administered to assess the effects of alcohol. The measure used was a vigilance/reaction time task which was presented at 20, 40, 60, and 80 minutes after alcohol consumption. Only a high alcohol dose (0.80 g/kg) had a significant mean effect. As is typical in such studies, no mention was made of individual differences in response to alcohol. In fact, the main presentation of data does not indicate whether the variability bars refer to standard errors or standard deviations. However, we can deduce from the results that the bars refer to plus and minus one standard error of the mean. The results suggest a difference of about one standard deviation

between the pre-alcohol mean and the post-alcohol mean. These results suggest that only about 20 per cent of the variance in performance under a high dose of alcohol is explained by the effect of alcohol. In other words, there is 55 per cent overlap in the no-alcohol distribution and the 0.80 g/kg distribution, which means that individuals in the top 16 per cent of the alcohol distribution outperformed half of the distribution under the no-alcohol condition.
Taken as a whole, our results suggest that an individual's response to alcohol is but poorly predicted by the averageeffects so often reported (and used by police and courts). Some individuals perform as well at 0.100 g/dl BAC as they do at 0.0. Further, many individuals at 0.100 g/dl BAC outperform many others who are at 0.0.
Even though we did not directly test the effects of alcohol on driving, we would be remiss if we did not attempt to discuss these results with respect to driving and to drunk-driving laws, as it seems obvious that many of the functions tested are pertinent to driving skills. The results showing mean performance decrements after the initial dose of alcohol are consonant with a large literature. What seems to have been overlooked, however, is that these are mean decrements. Individual differences after alcohol dosage are large and pervasive. For some individuals, the mean is a very poor predictor of performance.
Another aspect which seems to have been overlooked is the rapid development of functional tolerance. Judging even from the mean effect, most individuals perform better when their BAC has been high for a period of hours, compared to the immediate effects of aleo-
