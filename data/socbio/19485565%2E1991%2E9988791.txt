ABSTRACT: The rates of fetal loss and family planning acceptance among Bhopal gas victims from 1984 to 1989 were compared to those of a control group. In all, 136 eligible women in the affected area and 139 women in the control area were interviewed. Care was taken to ensure that these women had conceived at least once during the previous five years. The fetal loss rate among the gas-affected women was abnormally high (26.3 per cent) compared to that of women in the control area (7.8 per cent). Family planning acceptance in both areas was similar, with most women using permanent methods. In the case of temporary methods, the percentage of use was higher in the gas-affected area.

On the night of December 3, 1984, the Union Carbide plant situated at Bhopal, India, released a highly poisonous gas, methyl isocyanate (MIC), which spread over 40 sq. kms. and seriously affected people as distant as 5-8 kms. from the plant site (C.S.E., 1986). It killed several thousand and affected another 200,000 to 250,000 people in a few hours (Morehouse and Subramanium, 1986).
The impact of any disaster, natural or industrial, is felt more acutely by the vulnerable members of the society, among whom are the women and children. The Bhopal gas tragedy was no exception. The studies and newspaper reports published so far have viewed the immediate impact of the Bhopal disaster on women and children who were exposed to the gas leak. However, no study has been done to assess the subsequent behavior of women exposed to MIC, including any changes in fertility regulation practices that the perceived after-effects of MIC might have generated.

The present study was conducted in 1989, with the following objectives: (1) to study spontaneous fetal losses, and (2) to assess the knowledge and practice of different family planning methods after the Bhopal gas leak. In order to obtain a clear picture about the impact of the gas leak on the fetal wastage and family planning knowledge and practice, the study was conducted in two areas, namely the area affected by the Bhopal gas tragedy and a control area.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
SELECTION OF THE SAMPLE
In 1985, ICMR had identified different areas according to the degree of exposure to the gas leak, dividing them into three categories: (1) severely affected; (2) mildly affected; and (3) not affected, or control area.
In the severely affected area, Jaiprakash Nagar was randomly selected, while a control area of similar socioeconomic status was selected from ar-

eas identified as not affected. The selected areas were Annanagar, Ishwar Nagar, Gautam Nagar, and Vikas Nagar. There were 136 eligible women in the affected area and 139 women inthe control area who were selected purposively and interviewed. Care was taken to ensure that all the eligible women in the age group 20-44 had at least one pregnancy during the previous five years. To make the two groups comparable, it was decided to take equal proportions from Hindus and Muslims.
SOCIOECONOMIC PROFILE
OF THE STUDY AREA
In terms of social conditions, both the gas-affected and the control area were found to be quite similar. Social conditions were measured in terms of literacy, educational attainment, occupation, marital status, etc. A chisquare test was calculated to test the difference between the two areas for the above categories, and the difference was not statistically significant.
Regarding economic status, a standard of living index (SLI) was calculated by taking into account household possessions, such as drinking water facilities, toilet facilities, etc. The difference in SLI between the two areas was statistically significant. This difference is likely to be the result of compensation received by the gas-affected households. Since the tragedy, many facilities have been provided to the victims, like better drinking water facilities and the "Sulabh complex" run by Sulabh International,1 as well as em-

ployment opportunities. Thus, it can be said that the change in standard of living is a recent phenomenon.
RESULTS
FETAL LOSS
In this study, fetal loss has been defined as loss up to 28 weeks of gestation. Pregnancies terminating after 28 weeks were taken as stillbirths. The loss rate was computed per hundred pregnancies. Pregnancy status at the time of tragedy and in the intervening period was recorded by asking appropriate questions of women age 20-44 in both areas. Thus, cohorts of women were identified on the basis of conception following the gas leak. The firstyear cohort included women who had conceived as early as April, 1984.Each woman pregnant at the time of the tragedy was followed for the outcome of pregnancy, and the same was done for subsequent years up to the time of survey.
At the time of tragedy, there were 75 pregnant women in the affected area compared to 60 in the control area. The number of pregnancies reported was higher in the affected area because just after the gas leak a great deal of medical attention was directed to the area, and all pregnancies diagnosed. Of 75 pregnancies at the time of tragedy, 20 women (26.7per cent) had spontaneous fetal loss, while in the control area the number was 6 (10.0 per cent) (Table 1).

Out of the 20 fetal deaths in the affected area, 16 were aborted in the same month (December, 1984), while the remaining 4 were aborted in subsequent months.
In subsequent years, out of the total pregnancies in the affected area (255), 26.3 per 100 pregnancies terminated in fetal losses, while in the control area the figure was 7.8. This finding indicates that women in the affected area were still experiencing fetal losses at almost the same rate as immediately after gas exposure. This could be due to a persistent effect of MIC on the reproductive capacity through deteriorating health of the women in the affected area due to repeated pregnancies and fetal deaths.
Several empirical studies have shown that the rate of fetal loss varies substantially with the age of the mother (Bongaarts and Potter, 1983). Therefore, in the present study an attempt was also made to see whether the rate of spontaneous fetal loss varied with the age of mother. In the affected area, fetal deaths were higher for all the age groups (Table 2), while in the control area fetal deaths varied with mother's age, the normal pattern. Fetal loss was high in the younger age group 15-19, decreased in the 20-29 age group, and rose again in the 30 + age group.

MULTIPLE CLASSIFICATION ANALYSIS
The technique of multiple classification analysis has been widely used in demographic research in recent years. It is the same as multiple regression analysis, using categorical variables as predictors. It assumes an additive model in which the predictors can be in the interval scale or dummy variables. The dependent variables have to be in the interval scale or a binary scale. The problem of multicollinearity among the predictors is also circumvented in this technique, but the findings are sensitive to the presence of interaction among the variables. The input data format and the interpretation of findings are quite simple and straightforward in this method of analysis.
Multiple classification analysis (MCA) was carried out to determine whether literacy, standard of living index, and area (exposed and control) determine significantly the rate of fetal losses, controlling for age.

1,218 women in the control area, the results are similar. The abortion rate estimated in the present study was 26.7 in the affected area and 10.0 in the control area.
KNOWLEDGE AND PRACTICE
OF CONTRACEPTIVES
Contraceptive acceptance has been linked with the study of fetal loss because it was felt that a high rate of fetal loss and any perceived after-effects of MIC might have resulted in fertility regulation practices among the gas victims.
With regard to the awareness of family planning methods, it was found that the areas were almost similar, with the largest number of women knowing about terminal methods (vasectomy and laparoscopy). Among the temporary methods, the condom was the most widely known in both areas.

EVER USE
Women who had ever used any method of contraception after the tragedy were considered as ever users. The percentage of ever users was slightly higher in the affected area (50.0 per cent) compared to the control area (48.9 per cent) (Table 5). However, the percentage of acceptors of female sterilization was 48.5 per cent in the affected area and 63.2 per cent in the control area, showing that the use of a terminal method was higher in the control area.
Preference for spacing methods over sterilization can largely be attributed to the frequent visits of medical teams to the affected area. These medical teams make regular visits to check the health status of the gas victims. Apart from providing health services, the medical personnel also provide counseling to the victims about the
