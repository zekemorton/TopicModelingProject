Five years ago, when it was expected that the acceptability of the pill and the intrauterine device might match their effectiveness, high, even extravagant, hopes were held for these two modern contraceptives. Subsequently, numerous follow-up studies have documented high attrition rates.
Since the discovery and repeated corroboration of these high discontinuation rates for the IUCD and the pill in mass familyplanning programs (Mauldin, Nortman, and Stephan, 1967; Mauldin and Jones, 1967) the trend has been in the direction of a multimethod approach. For example, in the large Indian, Korean, and Pakistan programs (Chandrasekhar, 1968; Ross et al., 1969; United Nations, 1969) methods of both modern and traditional contraception as well as sterilization are all being stressed, and abortion tolerated if not encouraged. If the Taiwan program continues a predominant emphasis on the IUCD, it is mainly because of evidence that terminators of the IUCD are finding their way to a variety of procedures outside the program.
While it is now generally accepted that a single contraceptive is not enough to sup-

port an entire family-planning program, it is still worth assessing how much may be accomplished by a single contraceptive in order to acquire more perspective on how much of the job has to be shouldered by supplementary procedures--alternative contraceptives, abortion, and sterilization. The purpose of this paper is to present first results from a computerized matrix model and more specifically to estimate the impact of the IUCD consistent with given ages of acceptance and retention rates. The intrauterine device is selected over the pill for discussion because its continuation rates in mass programs have generally been more favorable than those of hormonal contraception.
BACKGROUND
Two kinds of contraceptive impact must be distinguished: first are demographic effects on the population in terms of births averted and birth rates lowered; second are the benefits to individual couples in terms of aiding them to space and limit births.
The number of births averted by a contraceptive depends on the number of acceptors and on births averted per acceptor. In populations where contraception is not yet widespread, the most likely acceptors of

program contraception are couples (1) who have all the children they want, i.e., have a limiting rather than a spacing motive; (2) who believe themselves still fertile; and (3) who have not yet found their way to a satisfactory contraceptive (Potter, Freedman, and Chow, 1968, p. 850, 851). Acceptors tend to have shorter open intervals from last birth thannonacceptors (Berelson, 1969, p. 370, 371). Presumably a recent delivery makes the issue of family limitation more salient and serves notice of continued fertility. This selection is important because a recent birth heightens chances that the couple are still fertile. As a result of a lower proportion sterile, their fecundity tends to be higher than that of coeval nonacceptors by a relative amount that increases with advancing age.
Among couples seeking to limit rather than to space births, births averted per acceptance of a contraceptive depend principally on three factors (Potter, 1969, p. 417420; Wolfers, 1969). First is the couples' fecundity and the prospect that they will remain fertile during usage of the contraceptive. Second is the length of usage and its outcome in accidental pregnancy or not. Third is the degree to which the program contraceptive is substituting for other family-planning measures and the relative efficacy of these procedures.
Because of its close relation to her current and prospective fecundity, a woman's age at time of acceptance is of great importance. If most marriages are being contracted while the bride is in her teens or early twenties, if there is little spacing of births, and if mortality is fairly low so that typical family-size objectives are 3-5 births, then the mother's mean age at attainment of desired family size is likely to be in the neighborhood of 30 years, though with a wide dispersion around this mean. To the extent that there is late marriage, deliberate child spacing, or high infant mortality forcing compensatory births and encouraging larger family-size targets,

the mean age at last desired birth will of course rise above 30.
At the beginning of a national familyplanning program, with little contraception and mostly abortion having been practiced previously, all couples at or beyond desired family size "who believe themselves still fertile are prime candidates for the recommended contraceptive. Consequently, the program obtains a good response from women in the last third as well as the middle third of the reproductive period. As a result, mean age of mother at first acceptance of program contraception in several Asiatic programs (Mauldin et al., 1967, Table 3) falls mostly in the range of 32 to 34 years.
After several years of program activity, many of the women 35 and over have already tried the recommended contraceptive and either are practicing it or have finished with it. More and more, the eligible candidates, when they are not spacers, are limiters who have recently reached desired family size and are in their late 20's or early 30's. Hence, as observed in Taiwan or Korea, the average age of IUCD acceptors has been progressively declining toward a value nearer 30 years (Berelson, 1969, p. 362; Freedman and Sun, 1969, p. 18).
Accordingly, in what follows, age 32.5 years may be taken as a typical age of acceptance while 27.5 signifies a rather young age and 37.5 an age considerably older than average.
THE MODEL
The present model is designed to follow the residual fertility of a cohort of women who at the same exact age, directly following a birth, have an intrauterine device inserted. The model is of the expected-value type based on procedures of matrix multiplication. Its computer program, ACCOFERT, and the derivations of parameter values are described in a technical appendix available on request (Potter, ms.).
The perspective is biostatistical. At any

time during the reproductive period a woman either is already sterile or if still fertile she is in one of three states: fecundable, anovulatory, or pregnant. During the third month of pregnancy she is exposed to the risk of abortion, During the ninth month of pregnancy, she faces a risk of stillbirth. These risks of spontaneous fetal wastage increase with advancing age. Following an abortion, the anovulatory period is one month; following a stillbirth, the anovulatory period is distributed with a mean of 2 months and a standard deviation of 1.2; following a live birth it is distributed according to a Pascal distribution, though with the two parameters progressively changing to give a mean and standard deviation that increase with age. During an anovulatory month a woman cannot conceive, while during a fecundable month chances of conception are governed by her natural fecundability. This natural fecundability declines as she ages. The onset of secondary sterility may occur any month unless she is pregnant. I t is assumed that sterility cannot interrupt a pregnancy, but risk of sterility accumulates during a pregnancy and therefore may happen directly following it. The conditional monthly probabilities of becoming sterile if nonpregnant and fertile at start of the month or if just terminating a pregnancy are also treated as functions of wife's age.

FECUNDITY PARAMETERS
Parameter values respecting fecundability, risk of spontaneous fetal wastage, and length of postpartum anovulation are summarized in Table 1 and are more precisely defined in the aforementioned appendix. These assumptions are chosen to fit with the results of a series of statistical analyses of Taiwan data by A. K. Jain (1969a, 1969J, 1970). In the second to last column of Table 1 are given the birth intervals expected of still fertile women if the fecundity parameters characteristic of a specified age were to remain constant. These expected intervals increase from slightly over two years at the start of the reproductive period to three and a half years near the end of it, with a gain of 10 months between ages 20-24 and 35-39 years.
From the work of L. Henry, (1961, p. 85), it is posited that the proportions sterile at ages 20, 25, 30, 35, and 40 are 0.03, 0.06, 0.10, 0.16, and 0.31 respectively. Proportions sterile at intermediate ages are derived by linear interpolation. From these proportions sterile at exact age x are calculated the age-specific conditional probabilities of becoming sterile during a month if still fertile at the start of the month. Above age 40 years, it is assumed that the proportion sterile increases linearly to 1.0 at age 46.5 years. This latter figure was reached by a

vented from realization by the intercession of sterility.
As noted already, if a woman has produced a birth at age x, she cannot have become sterile earlier. Hence, the older her known age at a birth, the older becomes her expected age at onset of secondary sterility. This progressive increase in the expected age at onset of sterility is important because it means a larger potential fertility at advanced ages than would otherwise be the case. For example, according to Columns 5 and 6 of Table 2, expected additional births and pregnancies following a birth at age 37.5 years are still 1.5 and 2.0 respectively.
ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT CONTRACEPTION
Another set of assumptions relate to effectiveness of the IUCD and the length of its retention. Effectiveness refers to the proportionate reduction in fecundability effected by the device in situ. From another analysis (Potter et al., 1970, p. 98, 99) is obtained an estimate of 0.95 effectiveness. Assumptions about retention are guided by unpublished results from a life-table analysis by A. Hermalin and L. P. Chow of data from the second Taiwan island-wide follow-up study of IUCD acceptors. The data are coded in terms of "multiple segments" rather than just first segments. If a woman's first segment of IUCD use is followed by a reinsertion without a pregnancy intervening, the second segment is combined with the first to form a multiple segment. It is estimated that these multiple segments include about 90% of all reinsertions.2
Life-table data on IUCD retention typically show during the first few months a drop in the conditional probability of terminating useful wearing of a device during the month if wearing it usefully at the start of the month. These conditional probabilities then level off at a value which is high at young ages and progressively lower for older

ages of acceptors (Freedman and Takeshita, 1969, p. 251-254). To allow for the relatively higher discontinuation rates of the first few months, a proportion of immediate droppers of the device is postulated. A methodology similar to that of Mauldin, Nortman, and Stephan (1967, p. 7, 8) is used to estimate the proportion of women not immediately dropping the IUCD and the constant monthly conditional probability of discontinuing the IUCD typical for each five-year age group of acceptors. For lack of data, the parameter values derived for age group 35-39 years are ascribed to age group 40-44 years.3
The basic life-table data and parameters estimated from them are assembled in Table 3. The last column lists expected lengths of retention, which range from 22 months for acceptors age 20-24 years to nearly 60 months for acceptors aged 35-39 years. Actually, these expectations are an oversimplification of what occurs in the model. The useful wearing of a device may be ended by sterility, by accidental pregnancy, or by dropping it (i.e., by expulsion or removal). Leaving aside the onset of secondary sterility, the conditional monthly probability of terminating the IUCD rises for a time after a birth as the proportion of wearers passing beyond anovulation and therefore becoming subject to the risk of accidental pregnancy rises. Later the probability of terminating declines very gradually as a consequence of the slow decline of natural fecundability.
Contraception affects fertility by holding women in the fecundable state longer than would otherwise be the case. Intervals from birth to next conception or to secondary
3 Twenty-four months after insertion, the relative frequency of pregnancy, expulsion, and removal as reasons for terminating the first segment are 0.16, 0.29, and 0.55. Reinsertion rates after pregnancy, expulsion, and removal are 0.19, 0.65, and 0.09. Multiplying reinsertion rates by respective frequencies and standardizing so that the three products sum to 1.0, one obtains for pregnancy 0.11, for expulsion 0.62, and for removal 0.17. Thus, reinsertions following pregnancy account for a little more than 10% of total reinsertions.

device is inserted. This large number of abortions reflects partly the length of the period between terminating the device and onset of secondary sterility, but also reflects the brevity of intervals between consecutive abortions when contraception is not practiced. In contrast to a live birth that entails 9 months of pregnancy and perhaps a year of anovulation, an abortion entails only 3 months of gestation and perhaps one month of postabortion anovulation. Furthermore, without contraception the span of fecundable months needed for a conception averages under a year. An implicit assumption is that the induced abortions are done in a medically competent manner and therefore do not increase the risks of secondary sterility.
From a population standpoint, a basic measure of impact is births averted per multiple segment of IUCD. For a given age of acceptance and for given effectiveness and retention of the device, births averted will be maximal when the device is not substituting for other measures of family limitation. The case of nonsubstitution may be operationalized by taking a cohort of women who adopt the IUCD at a given age x, practice it for one multiple segment, and then

lapse into nonuse, and compare this cohort with the same cohort when they practice nothing from age x onwards. Differencing the mean number of fecundable months to next conception of the two cohorts (i.e., subtracting entries of Col. 4, Table 2 from those of Col. 4, Table 4) gives the net delay of next conception per segment of IUCD (second column of Table 6). Differencing additional births per woman of the two cohorts (i.e., subtracting values in Col. 2, Table 5, from those of Col. 5, Table 2) yields births averted per segment of IUCD (third column of Table 6). Delaying the next conception shortens the residual reproductive period when additional births are a possibility. By stipulating nonpractice of family limitation after the next conception, the births foregone by the given shortening of the residual reproductive period are maximized.
Despite this maximization, the estimated births averted per multiple segment of IUCD prove to be less than one. Reaching a maximum among acceptors aged 32.5 years, the impact is less among younger acceptors because of their shorter retention and is less amongst the oldest acceptors mainly because of the truncation of useful
