ABSTRACT: This study is an attempt to use a hazards model to estimate the relative risks of mortality experienced at different periods during the first year of life among Malaysian infants breast-fed for various durations. Data on mortality, breast-feeding, and social variables were obtained from the retrospective Malaysian Family Life Survey and were used after checking for quality and consistency. Using LOGLIN to calculate hazards models, essentially multidimensional life-tables, we found that breast-feeding had an effect on mortality independent of socioeconomic variables and birth cohort. There was a monotonic relationship between breastfeeding duration and lower infant mortality during each of four subdivisions of the first year of life. Breast-feeding was a statistically significant predictor of mortality in the first six months. The results are compared with those from the Rand study, which employed regression rather than hazards models.

Dietary risk factors in infancy have recently been the subject of much research and heated discussion. In 1980, controversial action was taken when the World Health Organization adopted the voluntary International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes, against the opposition of the infant formula industry (World Health Organization, 1980; Clarkson, 1981). This paper presents a case study of the importance of breast-feeding in one Third'World environment and shows how the protective effect of breast-feeding varies in different settings and at different intervals during the first year of life. It also serves as a worked example of a hazards model analysis of a time-dependent var-

iable and provides a comparison with the work of Butz, DaVanzo, and Habicht of the Rand Corporation (1982), who used linear probability regression equations to study mortality determinants in subperiods of the first year of life, using the same data set.
Of course, much of what is known about mother's milk does lend credence to the hypothesis that breast-feeding in infancy increases a baby's survival chances. Mother's milk contains antiinfective cells and chemicals (Jelliffe and Jelliffe, 1979). The nutrition literature shows that mother's milk isthe optimum mix of nutrients for the developing infant (Thomson and Black, 1975). Finally, several studies attest to the dangerous levels of bacterial contamination found in containers and utensils with which alternative foods are prepared (Laditan and Reeds, 1976; Phillips et al., 1969;Rowland etal., 1978).

extent to which breast-feeding in infancy actually confers a survival advantage in specific environments cannot be deduced apriori. Analysis of the empirical effects of breast-feeding on infant mortality must be carried out in diverse settings and must take into account the effects of other variables likely to have an effect on feeding practices, infant mortality, or both.
In European nations during the closing decades of the nineteenth century, there apparently were large mortality differentials between infants exclusively bottle-fed and those exclusively breastfed. For example, in Berlin in 1895-96 the death rate in the former group was 376 per thousand, while in the latter it was 57 (Knodel, 1977). The early studies reviewed by Knodel ignore the possibility of confounding socioeconomic variables, but the consistent rinding of the protective effects of mother's milk is of interest. Recent research on breastfeeding in Western nations provides equivocal evidence of breast-feeding's protective effects. Some studies have found morbidity differentials (Douglas, 1950; Cunningham, 1977), while others have not (Stevenson, 1947; RCGP, 1972; Adebonojo, 1972). Diet-related mortality differentials have decreased substantially since the late nineteenth century, probably due to general improvements in the sanitary condition of food and water supplies (McKeown, 1979).
Given the presumed importance of sanitary improvements, and the association of such improvements with economic development, the impact of feeding practices on infant death rates should be most important today in the least developed nations. In fact, relatively few thorough studies of the relation of diet to infant mortality have been

carried out in such nations, and even good morbidity studies are surprisingly uncommon. Plank and Milanesi (1973) found that in fifteen communities in Chile the relative risk of post-neonatal death among those solely bottle-fed was three times that among babies who were solely breast-fed. In one study of three Arab villages, infants who had been solely bottle-fed were hospitalized with diarrhea almost fifty times as frequently as those who were solely breast-fed (Kanaaneh, 1972). Much other work has been flawed by small, biased, or unrepresentative samples. For example, Dugdale (1971) found that breast-feeding had no relationship to morbidity in a sample of 250 Malaysian infants, while Manderson (1981, p. 175), on the contrary, ". . . established a significant relationship between artificial feeding and the incidence of gastroenteritis" in infancy and childhood among 244 patients in a Malaysian hospital. However, Dugdale used a sample from a clinic population, perhaps consisting of mothers unusually knowledgeable and concerned about infant care, while Manderson based her conclusions upon proportions breast-fed among those hospitalized, without examining the corresponding proportion in any control group.
An understanding of the health impact of breast-feeding in different social and environmental circumstances is of enormous value for policy-making, particularly in developing nations. The present work is an attempt to estimate diet-related mortality differentials from multidimensional life tables, for a large and representative sample of a welldefined population, while taking into account the effects of socioeconomic variables. A hazards models analysis is particularly appropriate for the study of

breast-feeding and infant mortality. Over the course of the first year of life, the risk of dying usually exhibits a striking monotonic decline and endogenous causes of mortality are supplanted by exogenous ones. Therefore, the effects of breast-feeding duration on infant mortality should be modelled in a way which permits the risks and causes of dying to vary with time. Hazards model analysis can be used to assess the significance of influences on the risks of dying in various time intervals, taking into account the effects of a number of covariates (Trussell and Hammerslough, 1983). Many such studies, carried out in varied settings, will be needed if policy decisions concerning infant feeding practice are to be established upon a broad base of empirical evidence.
HAZARDS MODEL METHODOLOGY
Following theoretical work by Laird and Olivier (1981), Trussell and Hammerslough (1983) have illustrated how life tables with covariates can be estimated and tested by fitting log-linear multidimensional contingency table models with LOGLIN, a computer program developed at the Harvard School of Public Health. For the purposes of mortality analysis, covariates are variables which are expected to be predictors of death rates. LOGLIN calculates expected numbers of deaths for the cells of a table of discrete categories, based upon hierarchically specified models of main effects and their interactions (Olivier and Neff, 1978). Maximum likelihood estimates of elementary cells are computed by iterative proportional fitting. Log-likelihood statistics show the goodness-of-fit when comparing expected tables of deaths with the ob-

served figures. This permits the identification of preferred models and consequently of significant independent variables and interactions. The dependent variable is the log of the death rate, given as the sum of additive effects estimates. The ratio of exponentiated effects estimates provides a measure of relative risk when comparing the different categories of a given variable, while simultaneously controlling the effects of the other variables.
Differences in log-likelihood statistics between two nested models, a pair in which variables included in one model are a subset of those in the other, are distributed asymptotically as a chi-square distribution and are tested with degrees of freedom equal to the difference between the numbers of parameters in the two models. The associated /7-values show how likely it is that the simpler model is just as good at explaining the observed distribution of deaths as the more complex model, so when the pvalue is large we accept the model with fewer variables or interactions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The Malaysian Family Life Survey was carried out in 1976 among 1,262 households representative of the regions of Peninsular Malaysia (Butz and DaVanzo, 1978). The Rand Corporation, Survey Research Malaysia, and the Malaysian Government Department of Statistics all participated. The part of the survey used for this work was a retrospective questionnaire concerning pregnancy histories, feeding practice, and socioeconomic variables, answered by ever-married women under 50 years of age. In all, information on 5,593 births was available. Births were used as

the unit of analysis. A group of possible mortality determinants was selected for study on the basis of frequent mention in the literature.
Table 1 displays the categories of each of the hypothesized predictors of infant mortality. In some cases variable codes were collapsed due to small numbers. The variables used in the analysis were breast-feeding history, use of other food, birthweight, time period of birth, sex, availability of piped water, and birth order together with the length of the prior closed birth interval. The age of the mother at the time of the birth, and her ethnic group and formal schooling, were included also.
Whenever possible, the representativeness of the sample was tested by comparing the reported patterns of the selected variables to national figures or plausible limits. Survey distributions of maternal age, ethnic group, piped water availability, birth cohort, and schooling were comparable to national distribu-

tions (Chander et al., 1977; Fernandez etal., 1975;MalaysiaDept. of Statistics, 1970; Ooi, 1976). The sex ratio at birth was not significantly different from 105. Reported parities by age and by ethnic group were similar to WFS figures (Chander et al., 1977). Birthweights were statistically shown to be normally distributed in every cohort and ethnicity subgroup, as is expected. Within each subgroup, distributions of durations breast-fed were heaped on multiples of six months, but nonetheless did not differ significantly from the model breastfeeding distribution developed by Lesthaeghe and Page (1980). The infant mortality rates showed some sampling fluctuations when examined by birth cohort and ethnic group, but overall rates by cohort were comparable to those in Malaysian vital statistics reports (Sidhu and Jones, 1981), and Haaga (1986) has shown that the trends in time by ethnic group in the Rand study are not generally different from national figures if

three-year moving averages are used to smooth the curves.
The income variable seemed not to be a good measure of socioeconomic status. Fully half the women reported an income of zero. While some of these may be engaged exclusively in child care in the home, others may be doing labor on family-owned farms, while still others may be employed on plantations or elsewhere outside the home for payment in goods. Reported income was not correlated with the other measures known to be good indicators of social standing in Malaysia, such as ethnic group and mother's education. In view of the uncertainty of what the income variable was measuring, it was not used.
Another variable also proved to be of only limited use: the age at which "baby first received food or drink regularly other than breast milk" (Fain and Kheong, 1978). For 54 per cent of babies born in the sample, that age was reported as two months or less. No deaths were reported after the start of the third month among those receiving "no other foods," because of low rates and small numbers. In the public use data tape, dietary alternatives to breast-feeding are not specified, further limiting the utility of the variable for this analysis.
STATISTICAL MODELLING
In fitting the hazards models to these data, we made two critical decisions about modelling. First, to provide adequate samples in subperiods of the first year of life, analysis intervals were constructed starting at ages 0, 2, 4, and 7 months, and including up to 13 months of exposure. All models are estimated separately for each of the four intervals, so that the changing importance of the factors contributing to infant mortality can be seen. Second, a breast-feeding

variable had to be created for each interval which would reflect each baby's feeding history as of the start of that time period. The breast-feeding status in the current interval, the interval for which effects estimates were being calculated, was not included, because if a child stopped breast-feeding in the interval in which it died, it would not be clear whether cessation of nursing caused the death or vice versa. An inherently biased variable could result. For the first interval, the variable was dichotomous: the ever/never breast-fed question was used.
For each interval, a main effects model was fitted first. In each case a highly significant fit compared to a fully saturated model was obtained using the chosen predictors, as shown in Table 2. In order to fit a more parsimonious model, and to test the relative importance of variables during different intervals, each variable was to be dropped one at a time, and the loss of goodnessof-fit measured. However, it was important to test first for interactions in the main effects model, lest variables be dropped which have important effects only in combination with others.
Several such interactions were subjected to testing, because of prior hypotheses. Ethnic group and cohort might show a significant interaction if the health conditions of the different ethnic groups in Malaysia were improving at different rates. Ethnic differences in mean birthweight were observed in the data set and led to the testing of a model with an ethnic group/birthweight interaction term. It seemed reasonable to expect an interaction between birthweight and breast-feeding because of the presumed susceptibility of lowbirthweight infants to infection. If alternative foods were prepared with con-

taminated water, we might expect an interaction between piped water and breast-feeding. Finally, the interaction between education and breast-feeding was also tested. Table 3 compares the model with all main effects with models obtained when adding interactions to them. Chi-square values and the applicable degrees of freedom are shown, together with the associated probability levels. Remember that a small /5-value indicates a gain in fit with a more complex model. The only clearly significant interaction occurs in the first interval, where the joint effect of ethnic group and birthweight is significant.
The set of runs in which variables were dropped from the main effects model one at a time is summarized in Table 4. The numbers of persons and of person-months of exposure in each interval, together with the number of deaths, are also displayed.

To obtain parsimonious main effects models, deaths in each analysis interval were fitted using only the variables which had caused a significant loss of fit at the 10per cent level when dropped individually from the complete main effects model for that interval. If the resulting model showed a significant loss of fit at the 10per cent level compared to the complete main effects model, the omitted variables were added back, in decreasing order of significance, until a model was obtained which did not provide a significantly poorer fit than the model with all main effects. The variables which are omitted from the parsimonious main effects model obtained by this procedure are marked in Table 4.
The addition of selected interaction terms to main effects models with nine or ten variables had already been tested for statistical significance. Could these interactions significantly improve the fit

tality. The standard errors of the estimates are presented in Table 7. For the first interval the preferred model is the parsimonious main effects model with the addition of the ethnic group/birthweight intersection term; for later intervals it is simply the parsimonious main effects model. These models are preferred to those with more variables and to fully saturated models on the grounds that they explain observed distributions of hazard rates quite well with relatively few variables. At the same time, relatively liberal procedures have been used to determine which variables should be included. Tipping the balance in favor of inclusion of variables seems justified in view of the difficulty of detecting determinants of infant mortality differentials.
THE PRESENT WORK AND THE RAND
STUDY
The directions and general patterns of effects estimates from the preferred models provide useful information about mortality determinants, even though the inclusion of variables is sometimes not statistically significant in accordance with the strictest criteria. In that sense this paper is an exploratory analysis rather than a formal test of hypotheses. The results of this analysis will be compared with the work of Butz, DaVanzo, and Habicht of the Rand Corporation (1982), who studied mortality determinants with the MFLS data using linear probability regression equations. The findings of the two studies are largely consistent. However, the Rand study became available after the completion of this analysis, and a number of differences make comparison difficult.
The dependent variable used in the Rand study is a dichotomous dummy: An individual either dies (coded as 1) or

does not (coded as 0). A linear relationship is assumed to exist between infant mortality and its determinants. Problems of heteroscedasticity render estimation of a dummy-dependent variable inefficient, and predicted values are not necessarily between zero and one in linear probability regression. In the hazards model the dependent variable is the logarithm of the death rate, related linearly to the covariates. Such models are not direct transforms of one another. Furthermore, in the Rand study, four age intervals were used to subdivide the first year of life, beginning at exact ages 0, 8 days, 1 month, and 6 months. As discussed earlier, hazard models were fitted for intervals beginning at 0, 2, 4, and 7 months.
The Rand study also differs from the present work in that stepwise procedures were not used to decide on the inclusion or exclusion of variables. Instead, Butz et al. (1982) calculated regression equations separately for three groups of variables and then for all variables together. The three groups were called biological attributes at birth, postnatal biological influences, and indirect family influences. A set of variables specified a priori was entered into each linear regression equation for each interval. The findings from hazards models are compared here only with that regression equation which includes all three classes of factors, except when otherwise specified, because the variables in the hazards models fall into all three categories.1
The coding schemes used for crucial variables differ in the two studies. For
1 Butz et al. also calculated logit regression equations including all three classes of factors, but for that analysis all their intervals were combined. We do not have a similar analysis for comparison.

dietary variables in particular the situation is confusing, owing to the possibility of feeding both mother's milk and other food to an infant in a given period. In the hazards models, a single variable represented the duration of breast-feeding prior to the interval under study, whether such breast-feeding was supplemented or not. As explained earlier, only breast-feeding prior to the analysis interval was considered, because if a child died and stopped breast-feeding in the same interval the direction of causality would be uncertain. A separate variable, "other food," was a dummy variable indicating whether or not any solid or liquid other than mother's milk was consumed by the infant.2 This variable was included in the first interval to allow for the effects of early supplementation or the complete failure to breast-feed. Consumption of "other food" could not be included in subsequent intervals, because after the first two months of life no deaths occurred among those few babies who had never received "other food."
In the Rand study, durations of unsupplemented and supplemented breast-feeding prior to the start of the interval in question were entered as two separate variables in each analysis, except that no variable reflecting feeding practice was used in the first interval (i.e., the first week of life). Breast-
2Unlike the breast-feeding variable, "other food" was dichotomousand referred to whether or not other food than mother's milk had been consumed by the end of the interval under study. Inclusion of experience in the analysis interval does not introduce a truncation bias with this variable, because the beginning rather than the end of a feeding practice is in question. Since the sudden exposure of the infant to new sources of infection might be expected to have a large and immediate impact, it was decided to forego the comparability of the reference periods of the breast-feeding and "other food" variables in favor of measuring the mortality effect of "other food" in the interval of maximum impact.

feeding durations were divided into onemonth categories for the last two intervals; for the second interval, information on days of breast-feeding in thefirst week of life was apparently employed (Butz et al., 1982,p. 12). The Rand coding scheme implicitly allows for three possible dietary combinations in a given interval: solely breast-fed, breast-fed with supplementation, and never breast-fed (those with a value of zero for both variables). These regimens cannot be fully differentiated in the hazards analysis. However, the distribution of Rand's unsupplemented breast-feeding variable is necessarily affected by the same problem of sample size which caused us to drop the "other food" variable, that is, only 16 per cent of babies still received unsupplemented breastfeeding after the first two months of life, and no deaths occurred among them.
In summary, there may be several reasons for the differences observed between the findings of Butz et al. (1982) and the hazards model analysis. First, the statistical assumptions underlying the models are different. Second, the procedures used to determine which variables to include in a model were different. Third, the narrow age intervals used in analysis are different in the two studies, exacerbating problems of sampling variability. Finally, the coding of the variables in the two models may have a most important effect on thefindings. Nonetheless, the two studies show results which are similar in substantively important ways.
RESULTS
The preferred models for the first three analysis intervals include breastfeeding as a predictor of infant mortality. It is a particularly significant deter-

minant in the first and third intervals. Consumption of mother's milk is an especially great advantage in the first two months of life, while consumption of "other food" adds appreciably to risk, according to the ratio of exponentiated effects estimates. The relative risk of dying among those who received food other than mother's milk is 6.26 compared to those who do not, and the infant who was never breast-fed is twelve times as likely to die as the infant who was breast-fed at some time. Several factors probably account for these high relative risks. Early in life, the protective effects of colostrum are at the maximum. Some babies might have special problems leading to early cessation of breast-feeding, for example. Some infants may receive supplementary food in an attempt to compensate for low birthweight. The high risks of death among these classes of infants may be responsible for the heavy mortality among those who subsist in whole or in part on "other food."
For the next two intervals, in which breast-feeding adds significantly to the fit of the model, the estimates of the relative risks of mortality among those who had been breast-fed longest compared to the never breast-fed were 2.46 and 7.28. These figures are less reliable than that for the first interval; the standard errors are much larger because later intervals have fewer deaths.
When breast-feeding is dropped from the main effects model for the fourth interval, the loss of fit is not statistically significant according to the preset criterion, so the factor is not included in the preferred model for that interval. However, Table 8 shows estimates for the model with all main effects for that interval, together with the corresponding standard errors. Note that even here

the effects estimates imply lower mortality risks when breast-feeding has been longer. This pattern of effects estimates is additional evidence in support of the hypothesis that the relation between breast-feeding duration and infant survival is positive and monotonic. The

present study does not find statistical support for the hypothesis in this interval, but it does provide evidence that the chances of surviving the first half year of life are probably better for infants receiving some mother's milk than for those who receive none.
Note that in the models for the last three analysis intervals, it is possible to distinguish between various breastfeeding duration criteria. In each of these analyses, mortality is far higher among infants never breast-fed than among those breast-fed for the longest duration. It is of great interest that those breast-fed for intermediate durations have intermediate effects estimates. This implies that the effect of breastfeeding persists after breast-feeding has stopped. For example, in Table 8 we see that at ages 7-12 months those weaned at 4 to 6 months enjoy lower mortality than those weaned at 1to 3 months.
In the Rand study, the regression coefficients for unsupplemented breastfeeding indicate a statistically significant negative effect on death rates in the second through fourth intervals (i.e., after the first week of life), while duration of supplemented breast-feeding was significantly associated with lower mortality in the third and fourth intervals (i.e., after the first month of life).
In each analysis interval, the regression coefficient for unsupplemented breast-feeding was of larger magnitude than that for supplemented breastfeeding, implying that supplementation was always relatively harmful. Since both coefficients were negative in each interval, individuals never breast-fed at all implicitly always had higher mortality than those receiving any combination of mother's milk and supplementary foods. Interestingly, although the breast-feeding variables were statisti-

cally significant in the fourth interval, the effects were quite small in the second six months of life. Mortality rates diminished by just two per thousand and three per thousand for each month of supplemented and unsupplemented breast-feeding respectively. This is generally consistent with the finding from hazards models that diet had a relatively weak effect on mortality in a roughly similar age category. In short, both studies provide valuable evidence for an important positive relationship between infant survival and duration of breastfeeding, particularly in the first half-year of life. The consistency of the two studies is especially noteworthy in view of the many differences between the investigations.
The availability of piped water to each infant was coded as a dummy variable in both studies. Piped water did not significantly determine infant mortality in any of the four intervals used in the hazards model. Butz et. al. found that the linear regression coefficient of piped water was significant and positive in the last three weeks of the first month of life (/ = 2.46), but far from significant at any other time in the first year. The very narrow interval in which water supply was significant may provide especially unstable estimates of the regression coefficients.
In Malaysia, ethnic group is intimately connected with nearly every socioeconomic variable, especially including typical occupation, financial wellbeing, and type of housing (Ooi, 1976). Thus, it is not surprising that the data show that the ethnic group of an infant has a consistently powerful effect on its survival chances in every interval. In each interval, the Chinese, a high status group in Malaysia, have the lowest mortality. The highest mortality is expe-

rienced in some intervals by the Indians, who work mostly on rubber plantations, and in other intervals by the predominantly rural, agrarian Malays. The Rand study, too, found Chinese ethnicity to be associated with lower risk of mortality, throughout most of the year.
Mother's education is, like ethnic group, a variable which is to some degree a measure of social status. We expected maternal education to affect infant survival indirectly through child-rearing skills. Indeed, mothers with some formal schooling seem to be able to reduce the effects of some of the exogenous causes of mortality. The variable can be dropped from the first three intervals, but is highly significant after the first six months. In the Rand study, the number of years of maternal education has no statistically significant effect on infant mortality at any subperiod of the first year of life. The difference in the results is probably due to the difference in coding.
While maternal education is expected to reduce exogenous causes of mortality, sex differentials in death rates are usually attributed to endogenous causes, except where treatment of infants differs markedly by sex. Such differentials should be most readily observable early in life. In this analysis, sex was a highly significant predictor of mortality during the first three intervals and was omitted from the model from 7-12 months of age. Butz et al. found in their analysis that the sex of the child was a significant determinant of mortality at every age, except during the second through fourth weeks of life. In both studies, female infants of every age had higher survival rates, even at ages where the effect was not statistically significant.
Some variables do not exhibit a con-

sistent pattern of significance levels over the age intervals in question. It would be unwise in view of the small numbers of deaths to judge the importance of variables solely on the basis of formal tests of significance.
CONCLUSIONS
This study shows that breast-feeding is an important determinant of infant mortality in Malaysia. The protective effect of breast-feeding is statistically significant up to six months, although it may well continue to be clinically significant at higher ages. The relationship between longer breast-feeding duration and lower relative risk of mortality persists at every period in the first year of life. The consumption of any food or drink other than mother's milk portends a substantially increased risk of dying in at least the first two months of life. The protective effect of breast-feeding seems to persist even after breastfeeding has stopped. Diet is an important predictor of mortality even though other variables closely related both to feeding practice and to mortality conditions are included and implicitly controlled in our models.
This is clearly a preliminary study and a great deal of further research will be necessary for a fuller understanding of the effects of diet on infant mortality. The precision of parameter estimates for short analysis intervals could be substantially increased by studies with larger samples, and it might then be possible to confirm our hypothesis of a monotonic relationship between breastfeeding duration and lower infant mortality risk.
