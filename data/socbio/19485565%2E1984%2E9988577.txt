ABSTRACT: Data from the 1976 National Survey of Family Growth were used to examine the effect of sociodemographic factors on choice of nonpermanent contraceptive methods among white, fecund, married women aged 15-44 who intend no additional births. A multivariate analysis revealed that age of the respondent had a strong negative relationship to the effectiveness of contraceptive chosen. Being Catholic had a negative effect on the effectiveness of contraceptive chosen. Parity and education alone had an insignificant effect on the effectiveness of contraceptive method chosen, but significant interaction occurred between age and parity and between age and education. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed.

Choice of contraceptive method and correctness of method use are major factors affecting the likelihood of an unwanted birth among fecund married women. Previous analysis of data from the 1976 National Survey of Family Growth indicates that 12 per cent of all births occurring to mothers 15-44 years of age were unwanted, with a much higher percentage unwanted among blacks than whites, 25.8per cent and 9.8 per cent, respectively (DHEW, 1980). The choice of ineffective contraceptive methods or ineffective use of effective methods undoubtedly contributes to the occurrence of the admitted as well as unadmitted unwanted births. To help parents prevent unwanted births and to obviate their social and health consequences, it would be desirable to understand the factors affecting the choice of contraceptive method.
The factors influencing contraceptive behavior (and hence method choice) can be classified in terms of characteristics of the method, of the user, and of the context (Miller, 1979). An important characteristic of the method is whether or not it is coitus independent

or coitus dependent (Vaugh et al., 1981). Coitus-independent methods do not require a coitus-related action to be taken at the time of use and include the nonpermanent methods of the pill and IUD or the permanent method of sterilization (male or female). Such methods are relatively new and require the users to make a long-term commitment compared with coitus-dependent methods.
Among characteristics of the user that can influence contraceptive behavior are: motivation to avoid additional births (Jones et al., 1980), the individual's attitude toward sexuality (Miller, 1979; Rainwater, 1960), future orientation (Oskamp et al., 1978) and perceived efficacy of contraceptive behavior (Luker, 1975).
These characteristics of the user can be modified by a number of contextual or background characteristics. Perceived risk of an unwanted pregnancy seems to wane due perhaps to reduced coital frequency or perceived reduction in fecundity as evidenced by the negative association between age of wife and years since first marriage with the effectiveness of contraceptive method cho-

sen (Mosher, 1982). Education has been found to have a positive association with the effectiveness of method chosen (Ryder and Westoff, 1971). In the 1960's, religion influenced the choice of contraceptive method (Westoff, 1973), but the difference between Catholics and nonCatholics in the percentage using coitusindependent methods narrowed sharply between 1965 and 1975 (Westoff and Jones, 1977). In 1965 about 10 per cent fewer white married Catholic women less than age 45 were users of nonpermanent coitus-independent methods than white non-Catholic women less than age 45, but by 1975 the difference was only 2 per cent. An effect of income on the use of coitus-independent contraceptive methods by women aged 15^4 was not observed in the 1973 and 1976 National Survey of Family Growth. In both surveys the percentage using coitus independent methods was about 31 per cent among women with family incomes of less than 150per cent and greater than or equal to 150 per cent of poverty (Ford, 1978).
A few studies have examined the factors influencing the choice of contraceptive methods. A recent report (Mosher, 1982) examined trends in use of contraceptive methods by major sociodemographic factors. Studies in this regard have been more descriptive than analytic. The specific purpose of this study is to examine, using a multivariate analysis, the effects of five predictor variables (age, total family income, religion, education, parity, and length of time since firstmarriage) on the choice of nonpermanent contraception chosen among white, married, fecund women who intend no additional births. The study sample was selected to control, to the extent possible, for motivation to avoid additional births (assumed uniformly

high) and for risk of pregnancy (all are fecund).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data were obtained from the 1976 National Survey of Family Growth which was conducted under the auspices of the National Center for Health Statistics. Women were eligible for inclusion in the survey if they were currently or previously married or if they were never married but had children of their own living with them in the household. The number interviewed for the final sample was 8,611 women 15-44 years old, of whom 6,482 were currently married. Data were used adjusting for selection probability inherent in the sample design and for nonresponse. Further details on the sampling used are provided by Grady (1979). The sampling design was a five-stage probability sample which included oversampling for blacks. Sample weights were used in our analysis but the weighting factor was deflated by dividing the weight for each case by the average weight in order to avoid undue power of significance tests. Since the identification of sampling units and strata in the sample design was suppressed from the public-use data tape, it was not possible to incorporate "design effects" in our analysis. Therefore, it is likely that the reported significance level is slightly exaggerated. The total number of cases selected for this study was 1,553 fecund married women who intend no additional births (128 black and 1,425 white), excluding women who reported having been sterilized or whose husbands have been sterilized. Due to the small number, black respondents were dropped from descriptive and multivariate analyses.

portance of predictors on contraceptive method choice and to determine the best cutting points categorization, an Automatic Interaction Detector (AID) analysis was used (Sonquist and Morgan, 1963). The AID analysis splits the study sample into two groups based on the predictor which accounts for more of the variance in the response variable than any other predictors. After an initial split, each of these groups are considered in turn, and an attempt made to split based on the predictor which explains most of the variance within each group. This process continues until no predictors meaningfully split any of the subgroups.
The statistical technique used for the discrete multivariate analysis is a weighted squares analysis approach (Grizzle et al., 1969; Forthofer and Lehen, 1981). The relative effectiveness of each woman's chosen contraceptive is used as the response variable and is regressed linearly on the categorical predictors: age of the respondent, education of the respondent, parity, length of time since first marriage and religion (Catholic or non-Catholic). In seeking an appropriate parsimonious model that fits the data we began with hypotheses of first-order interactions between: (1) age and education by respondent and (2) age and parity of respondent.
Effectiveness of contraceptive method chosen was weighted for each contraceptive category by calculating the mean use effectiveness ratings for methods in each category based on effectiveness ratings presented by Hatcher and Stewart (1980). Using these average effectiveness ratings, weights were assigned to each category resulting in a weight of 8 for the pill and IUD category, 5 for the condom, foam,

or diaphragm, and 1 for the rhythm, withdrawal, or nonuse category.
To perform the multivariate analysis a computer program for the Generalized Chi-square Analysis of Categorical data (GENCAT) was used. Using an approach suggested by Forthofer and Lehen (1981), we weighted each category of contraceptive method based on its average use effectiveness. A best fitting model was identified which included the terms representing each of the variables entered and interactions between them. A model which would attain a p-value of 0.25 or greater was sought, but with the available variables the best fitting model had a /?-value of 0.15. Contrast matrices were used to identify the effect of each variable used in the model on the effectiveness of method chosen.
RESULTS
Descriptive analyses were prepared showing the bivariate relationship between each of the predictors and choice of contraceptive method for Catholic and non-Catholic white women. As shown in Table 1, the differences between method chosen is marked between age categories with about twothirds of white Catholic women aged 18-29 years versus about one-third of white Catholic women aged 30-44 years using the pill or IUD. A higher percentage of non-Catholic women aged 30-44 and aged 18-29 use the pill or IUD than Catholic women, 10 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively. The percentage of white Catholic women in the method categories barrier/chemical or natural/ nonuse is correspondingly higher than for white non-Catholic women in the younger age group by about 4 and 2 per

tive method chosen than any other predictor. The younger age group (Group 2) exhibits a higher effectiveness score than the older group (Group 3). The predictor entered to split Group 2 is parity, and age is the best predictor for splitting Group 3.
Three other predictors were found to be important in further splitting of the younger age group (Group 2) in addition to parity: education, religion, and time since first marriage. Among women under age 32 with parity less than 2, education level is an important predictor of contraceptive effectiveness and those with less than 15years of education showed the highest effectiveness level of any group identified in the AID analysis. Among women under age 32 with parity of 2 or more, religion and time since first marriage are important predictors. Catholic women married seven years or more with parity 2 or more have the lowest contraceptive effectiveness value among women under age 32.
Among women aged 32 or more (Group 3) an additional split was observed into groups less than age 36 and greater than or equal to age 36. Among women aged 36 or more, income is the most important predictor of contraceptive effectiveness. Those with higher income ($15,000 or more) showed a greater value for contraceptive effectiveness level. Among women aged 36 or over in families of income $15,000 or more, religion and parity are important predictors of contraceptive effectiveness. The Catholic women of this group with parity less than four showed the lowest effectiveness of any subgroup identified in the AID analysis.
The splits identified through AID analysis were a major factor used in determining the categorization to use in

later stages of analyses. The use of AID analysis reduced the likelihood that important divisions for categorization were omitted.
The result of multivariate analysis is shown in Table 2. Family income was deleted from multivariate analysis due to the multicollinearity between family income and women's education and because cross-tabulation indicated education had a stronger association with method chosen. Because of the small number of cases with parity of 4 or more, parity was grouped into two categories: those women with parity 2 or less and those with parity 3 or more. Time since first marriage was deleted from multivariate analysis because of multicollinearity with age of respondent.
The results obtained from a multivariate analysis are consistent with those found in descriptive and AID analyses. An inverse relationship is observed between age and effectiveness of contraception used. The magnitude of the model parameter for ages 13-30 shows the highest positive influence on effectiveness of contraceptive method used. A weaker positive influence for ages3134 is observed. Being aged 35-44 has a negative effect on method effectiveness. When other variables are controlled, parity does not show a significant influence on method effectiveness chosen. Being Catholic has a moderately strong negative influence on the effectiveness of contraception chosen. Education level of wife has no significant influence on the effectiveness of contraceptive method chosen. To summarize, the highest level of contraceptive effectiveness would be expected among women ages 18-30 with parity less than 3 who are non-Catholic and have education less than 13years.

The findings from the study are generally in conformity with the relationships that would be expected between study variables and the effectiveness of contraceptive method chosen. Several explanations could account for the strong negative relationship between age and effectiveness of contraceptive method chosen among fecund white women intending no additional births, One explanation may be that increased age may result in reduced perception of risk that an unwanted birth will occur, Another explanation is that concerns about health risks associated with the pill or IUD use may lead to use of other methods among older women. However, this explanation is tenuous since

the percentages of IUD and pill users declined slightly between 1973 and 1976 in both the 15-29 year and 30-44 year age groups (Mosher, 1982). The most probably explanation of the observed relationship is a cohort effect, i.e., older women who began marital contraception at an earlier point in time have continued to use the same methods as were initially available early in their marriage. Such a persistence in the choice of contraceptive method was found by Ryder (1976). Separation of a true chronological age effect from a cohort effect is not possible using cross-sectional data.
The lack of a significant association between parity and the effectiveness of contraceptive method chosen based on multivariate analysis is most likely due to the high correlation between parity

and age. Although the cross-tabulation had indicated a significant association, when the effect of age was controlled the association between parity and effectiveness ofmethod chosen isno longer significant.
As was found indescriptive analysis of the effect of religion, the multivariate analysis also showed a significant negative relationship between effectiveness of contraceptive method and being Catholic. Although Westoff and Jones (1977) indicated a narrowing of difference inthe percentage using the pillor IUD between white Catholic and nonCatholic had occurred, among women intending noadditional births, religion still is an important factor influencing the choice of contraceptive method. The effect ofbeing Catholic remains strong when age is controlled. It is possible that among younger Catholic women who do intend additional births the influence of religion on method choice is diminishing which would explain the difference between the influence of religion observed from these data and the finding of Westoff and Jones (1977).
The lack of a significant effect of education on choice ofmethod may be explained by the nearly universal access to all methods of contraception for married women. Before the implementa-

tion of federal funding that made family planning services more accessible to low income women, it is possible that low education was associated with higher use of natural methods or nonuse dueto the high correlation between level of education and family income.
The best fitting model also included interaction terms for: (1) being aged18 to 31 with parity; and (2) being aged 18 to 31 with education. The direction of the coefficients for these interactions were as would be expected. Younger women with lower parity were more likely to have been using methods with higher effectiveness. The positive interaction coefficient for the interaction term ofage 18 to 31 with education less than 13 years could bedue toless concern or awareness ofthe health risks of pill or IUD use and/or less willingness to use barrier methods among women with education less than 13 years.
Although inference from crosssectional data analysis is limited, the findingsfrom this study would be a useful adjunct to our understanding of contraceptive behavior. Repeated studies along the same line forlater time periods would shed additional light on the understanding of current behavior patterns as well as future trends.
