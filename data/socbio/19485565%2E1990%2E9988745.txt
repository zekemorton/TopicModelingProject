ABSTRACT: A comparison of intra- and inter-ethnic divorce rates in Hawaii showed that inter-ethnic marriages resulted in a higher proportion of divorces than did intra-ethnic marriages when the marriage data used had to do with all marriages occurring in Hawaii. However, a sizeable portion of marriages in Hawaii are of nonresidents who, if they divorce, probably divorce elsewhere. Nonresident marriages are chiefly intra-ethnic marriages of Caucasians. When examining the proportions of divorces to resident marriages, within-group marriages are more at risk than inter-ethnic marriages. As in prior research, persons who marry members of other racial/ethnic groups tend to marry persons from groups with income levels similar to their own. As in previous reports, some cross-ethnic combinations appeared more at risk for divorce than did others. Group income appeared to be a predictor of risk. When considering only resident marriages as related to divorces, those marriages in which the bride was from a higher income group than the groom were at a significantly greater risk for divorce than marriage in which the bride came from an income group lower than that of the groom.

Marriage and divorce patterns in Hawaii have been of interest to researchers for the past fifty years (e.g., see Adams, 1937; Cheng and Yamamura, 1957; Lind, 1964; Parkman and Sawyer, 1967; Monahan, 1966; Schmitt, 1969; Leon, 1975; Schwertfeger, 1982; Johnson, 1984; Labov and Jacobs, 1986). Interest has resulted in large part from the very high rates of inter-racial and inter-ethnic marriages in Hawaii as compared with the rest of the United States. While some of the authors cited above were concerned with marriage, but not divorce, most of them presented data having to do with divorce as well. Three generalizations can be made from those reports that dealt with divorce: (1) interethnic divorce rates generally have been higher than intra-ethnic divorce rates; (2) differences in intra-ethnic and interethnic divorce rates appear to have decreased over time; and (3) some crossethnic marriage combinations are far

less likely to result in divorce than are others.
The present paper will bring up to date information concerning intraethnic and inter-ethnic divorce rates and will contrast data derived from marriage data having to do with all marriages as opposed to resident marriages (one or both members of the spouse pairs are residents) as each set of marriage data relates to divorce (resident only) data. Further, this paper will provide an explanation for a significant portion of the variance in resident marriage/divorce rates across different combinations of husbands and wives of Hawaii'sfivemajor racial/ethnic groups--persons of Caucasian, Chinese, Filipino, Hawaiian/part Hawaiian,1 and Japanese ances-
1Hawaiians and part-Hawaiians are listed separately in marriage statistics but are combined herein because (a) about 40 per cent of those persons stating that they were of unmixed Hawaiian ancestry are of mixed ancestry as shown by blood

elsewhere, the divorce rate of Caucasian x Caucasian marriages will be markedly underestimated. Second, for the same reason, within-ethnic-group divorces will be underestimated. It was only in 1985 that the State Department of Health listed resident marriages (one or both parties resident) separately from all marriages in the Annual report and specified separately for residents and for nonresidents who married whom, by race of partner. The present report contrasts marriage/divorce data based on all marriages with resident marriage/ divorce data for the years 1985, 1986, and 1987.
Analyses of Hawaii marriage data (Johnson, 1984; Labov and Jacobs, 1986) showed that the probability of marrying cross-ethnically was strongly related to group size; the smaller the group, the higher the probability of outmarriage. If outmarriage occurs, there is a strong tendency for those persons who outmarry to marry individuals from groups similar to their own in income level (Johnson, 1984). We shall examine the association of income with marriage/ divorce ratios for resident marriages/ resident divorces.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
SUBJECTS AND MEASURES

come of residents of Hawaii has stayed constant for over a decade. The most recent data (U.S. Bureau of Census,1983, census definitions of race are not fully comparable to the definitions used by the State of Hawaii Department of Health) show the mean family income of the five groups assessed herein to be, from high to low: Chinese, $32,388;Japanese, $31,994; Caucasian, $26,557;Filipino, $22,921; and Hawaiian/part Hawaiian, $22,166. (In eight of ten comparisons [5 groups x 2 sexes], persons who married across racial ethnic groups had lower mean incomes than those who married within their own group.) As mentioned earlier, prior research (Johnson, 1984) having to do with all marriages (since resident marriage data were not then reported on separately by race/ethnicity of partner) showed that persons who married across groups showed a strong tendency to marry persons from income groups similar to their own. We will present comparable data for resident marriages in the years 1985-87. In addition, these income data will be used in contrasting the divorce rates of resident marriages in which the bride is from an ethnic group higher in income than that of the groom with rates when the difference in group income favors the ethnic group of the groom.

The subjects are those persons from Hawaii's five major ethnic groups listed in the State of Hawaii Data Book (198688) as having married or divorced in 1985-87. Table 2 is a presentation of data for all marriages, for resident marriages, and for divorces, along with a presentation of percentages of divorces to marriages for all marriages and for resident marriages only.

Like many prior studies cited above in which all marriages and resident divorces provide the data for analysis, the data shown in Table 2 show the proportion of inter-ethnic marriages to divorces to be higher than the divorce ratios of intra-ethnic marriages (z = 16.22, p< 0.001; z score derived

from McNemar's [1949, p. 76] formula for establishing the significance of differences between proportions). This difference in favor of within-group marriages succeeding more often is almost solely a consequence of the fact that over half of all (resident plus nonresident) marriages are Caucasian x Caucasian marriages and, when assessing all marriages, Caucasian cross-ethnic marriages (especially those of Caucasian women) are more likely to result in divorce. When the proportion of divorces to marriages is calculated from only the resident marriage data, the differences are significantly (z = 25.85; p < 0.001) in the opposite direction; there is a lesser proportion of divorces to marriagesin inter-ethnic than in intra-ethnic marriages for the combined five groups. Looking at each group separately, we see that 29 of 40 possible outmarriages combinations (5 groups x 4 possible outmarriages x brides and grooms separately) are less at risk than withingroup marriages. Summing all crossethnic matings for given sex x ethnic group resident marriages, Caucasian husbands (z = 59.48, p < 0.001), Caucasian wives (z = 17.57,p< 0.001), and Filipino wives (z = 7.77, p < 0.001) have significantly lower across-group than within-group divorce-to-marriage ratios. The reverse is shown for Hawaiian husbands (z = 4.27, p< 0.001), with the across-group divorce-tomarriage ratio being higher.
The proportions of obtained to expected resident marriages, 1985-87, for each possible cross-group mating combination is shown in Table 3. The expected number is based on the per cent of persons in the total long-term resident population (ignoring, in this analysis, military and military dependents) of thefivegroups under consideration mul-

tiplied by the per cent that each of the four outgroups are of the outgroup population. The procedures used in calculating these values are fully described in Johnson (1984). The mean per cents of brides and grooms marrying across differing amounts of disparity in groupincome level are shown in Table 4. (For example, Chinese marrying Hawaiian/ Part Hawaiian spouses would differ by four income levels; Caucasians marrying either Chinese or Hawaiian/Part Hawaiian spouses would differ by two group-income levels.)
Like the earlier data, the present data show that persons who marry across racial/ethnic groups tend to marry persons from groups similar to their own in terms of income. This tendency is somewhat stronger for the present set of longterm resident marriages than it was for the data presented in Johnson (1984), based on all 1975-77 marriages.
The percentage ratio of resident marriages to divorces did not show any consistent variation across differing levelsof income disparity, as was shown above for marriage data. However, crossethnic marriages involving ethnic combinations in which the ethnic group income of the bride is higher than that of the groom vary significantly in divorce rate from the reverse combinations for resident marriages (38.96 per cent vs. 35.33 per cent; z = 3.64;p < 0.001).
DISCUSSION
One major problem in the use of these published demographic data needs to be raised prior to discussing the obtained results. Persons marrying in any time interval are not the same as those divorcing over the same time interval. If the proportions of inter-ethnic marriages change over time, comparing

present divorcedata (consisting, inlarge part, of couples married years previously) withpresentmarriages could lead to either an overestimate or underestimate of within- or across-group marriage-to-divorce rates. Data from Labov and Jacobs (1986, p. 83) and from the State Department of Health

Annual Report (1988)showonly a small increase, 1979-87,in outmarriagerates for most of the 10 groups (5 ethnic groups x 2 sexes) reported on herein, which indicates that this problem is not great. However, there has been a substantial increase in the proportions of Japanese (especially males) who out-

marry. In consequence, a comparison of the 1985-87 marriage to divorce ratio for persons of Japanese ancestry almost certainly results in at least something of an underestimate of Japanese interethnic divorce rates and an overestimate of Japanese intra-ethnic divorce rates.
There seems to be no really good way around the problem described above. One can study a marriage cohort across time, as was done by Schwertfeger (1982), but then one loses data from those who leave Hawaii and divorce elsewhere, and there probably are substantial ethnic differences in rates of migration from Hawaii. While differential rates of inmigration/outmigration and secular trends in intermarriage rates would have influenced the results we reported above it seems clear that the major source of difference in marriage risk of within vs. across ethnic group marriages is that which results from a comparison of all marriages with divorce data vs. resident marriages with divorce data.
Resident marriages were not reported separately in the State Department of Health Annual Report by race/ ethnicity of the spouses, from all marriages, including those of nonresidents, until 1985. Those studies cited in the introduction that reported on divorce data, using essentially the same procedure used herein, necessarily reported on the ratio of divorces to marriages using data having to do with all marriages including those of nonresidents. The present data set for all marriages is confirmatory of these earlier reports in showing a higher overall ratio of divorces to marriages for inter-ethnic marriages. As noted above, the higher risk for cross-ethnic marriages, for combined resident and nonresident marriages is almost solely the result of dif-

ferences found in the Caucasian sample. These differences are sharply reversed when the ratio of divorces to resident marriages forms the basis of analysis. The lesser proportion of inter-ethnic than intra-ethnic divorces to long-term resident marriages is largely a result of the striking difference in proportions among Caucasians. These very large differences are in part a consequence of the fact that visitors and transient residents usually are of Caucasian ancestry, and some of these people are getting divorces also. However, if Caucasians are excluded, 18 of 24 (2 sexes x 4 groups x 3 comparisons) of other crossethnic combinations show lower acrossthan within-group divorce-to-marriage ratios. Prior reports (nearly always based on marriage data that combined resident and nonresident marriages) to the contrary, cross-ethnic marriages of permanent residents in Hawaii are less rather than more at risk for divorce, perhaps because they require a greater initial commitment.
It has been shown (Johnson, 1984) that persons who marry members of groups other than their own tend to marry persons from groups similar to their own in income. The present data show this same tendency even more strongly for resident marriage data. Prior reports nearly always emphasize that some cross-ethnic marriage combinations are far less likely to end in divorce than are other combinations. Specific "good" or "bad" combinations vary across reports and, for the most part, explanations for variations in marital success are lacking.
The present report shows that the income levels of ethnic groups are associated with marriage/divorce ratios, risk being significantly greater for marriages in which the income of the bride's ethnic
