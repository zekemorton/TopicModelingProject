Two major methods have been used to study correlates of cross-sectional fertility differences: (1) the correlation of various personal characteristics with individual fertility, and (2) the correlation of average characteristics of population aggregates with the average fertility of these aggregates. The great bulk of cross-sectional fertility research has been by way of the individual method. Research on the aggregative level has probably been impeded by the valid and widely publicized warnings of Robinson (1950) that inferences concerning individual correlations could not necessarily be inferred from knowledge of correlations at the aggregative level. Nonetheless, despite Robinson's admonition, knowledge of correlations at the aggregative level may be as important as data concerning associations at the individual level. For example, the policy-maker charged with reducing the birth rate in a given area must be cognizant of the factors likely to affect the success of the program for the area as a whole and therefore must know the matrix of correlations on the level of the aggregates with which he deals.
Moreover, a policy-maker would be incorrect in assuming that a knowledge of

the multivariate regression of individual characteristics upon a dependent variable for individuals in some broad aggregate (such as a nation) coupled with knowledge of these characteristics for individuals in a particular smaller area (such as a county) would necessarily be sufficient to predict the values of the dependent variable for the individuals of the particular small subaggregate. Making such an assumption involves the "atomistic fallacy" (Riley, 1963). For example, Duncan (1964) has shown from data of the Indianapolis study that the average number of children ever born to women of each economic class among couples residing in a residential area of given socioeconomic status depends upon the status of that residential area as well as upon the economic status of the couple. Specifically, poor couples in high-status neighborhoods had fewer children than poor couples in lowstatus neighborhoods; similarly rich couples in high-status neighborhoods had fewer children than rich couples in low-status neighborhoods. Therefore, in obtaining an accurate prediction of the average number of children ever born to women residing in a neighborhood of given socioeconomic status, it is not enough to know simply the overall

relation for all residential areas of individual economic status and fertility, but rather the relation between individual economic status and fertility specific to the status level of the neighborhood for which fertility is to be predicted.
Obviously, neither the traditional individual analysis nor the traditional aggregative analysis is sufficient to give us a complete picture of the determinants of fertility behavior. A complete analysis, which Riley (1963) terms a social-system analysis, requires data for each individual on every relevant individual variable and on every relevant variable of each group to which that individual belongs. Unfortunately, we are still a long way from having knowledge of this sort concerning fertility behavior.
Previous studies correlating average characteristics of population aggregates with their average fertility have used four different types of aggregate as the unit of analysis. Whole nations served as the units of analysis in studies by Weintraub (1962), Adelman (1963), Russett (1964), Heer (1966), and Friedlander and Silver (1967). Subnational areal units were analyzed in Leasure's study of provinces of Spain (1963), Heer's study of local areas in Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador (1964), Heer and Turner's study of local areas in Latin American countries (1965), Collver, Speare, and Liu's study of townships in Taiwan (1967), Schultz's study of tmmicipios in Puerto Rico (1967), and Mazur's study of urban and rural parts of oblasts in the U.S.S.R. (1968).
A semiterritorial aggregate was used by Hathaway, Beegle, and Bryant (1969), who analyzed the correlates of cumulative fertility in 1960 for urban, rural-nonfarm, and rural-farm white persons in each county of the United States and of the four regions of the United States, and also the correlates of fertility for urban, rural-nonfarm, and ruralfarm nonwhites in each county of the South. Finally, a nonterritorial aggregate was em-

ployed by Mazur (1967) in his study of fertility among ethnic groups in the U.S.S.R.
In general, one cannot necessarily expect the type of association revealed for one type of population aggregate to hold for another type of aggregate (Duncan, Cuzzort, and Duncan, 1961). For example, the pattern of relationship between certain independent variables and fertility found when the nations of Latin America were the units of analysis might differ from the pattern when the subnational units of each Latin American nation were the units of analysis. Discrepant patterns will exist whenever the variability of independent variables or the dependent variable differs with the type of aggregate taken as the unit of analysis.
DEFINITION OF VARIABLES
In the present study, eight independent variables were correlated with one measure of fertility. The independent variables were: (1) the level of infant mortality in or around 1960, (2) the proportion of the total population in 1960 which was nonwhite, (3) the median income of males among all males with income in 1959, (4) the median number of years of schooling completed by persons 25 years old and over in 1960, (5) the proportion of women 14 years old and over in the labor force in 1960, (6) the log10 of the population potential of the county in 1960, (7) the ratio of males 20 to 54 years old to females 15 to 49 years old in 1960, and (8) the 1960 proportion of the total population Roman Catholic in the archdiocese or diocese in which the county was located. All of the population data used in the calculation of the dependent variable and the first seven independent variables were obtained from materials published in United Stales Census of Population: 1960 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1963), or Vital Statistics of the United States (U.S. Public Health Service, 1957-1967). Data on the Roman Catholic population of each archdiocese and diocese in the United States in 1960 were obtained

for each county were computed by summing over each five-year age group from IS to 49 years of age the product of the number of women in the five-year age group in the county in 1960 and the specific fertility rate for that five-year age group in the United States as a whole in 1960. The actual number of births used in the numerator of the ratio was derived as follows. If the number of births in the county in 1960 was 500 or more, the number of births in 1960 was considered the actual number of births. If the number of births in the county in 1960 was 100 to 499, a three-year average of births centered on 1960 was considered to be the actual number. If the number of births in

As a result, places with relatively low population density but contiguous to places of high population density have relatively high population potential compared to areas of similar population density situated away from areas of high population density. Moreover, areas of high population density situated away from other populated areas will have relatively low population potential compared to densely populated areas contiguous to other dense areas.

the proportion of the United States population which was Roman Catholic in January, 1960, was 22.9%. According to the 1957 Current Population Survey, when related children under 14 years of age were counted according to the religion of their mother, 26.3% of the United States population stated "Roman Catholic" when asked "What is your religion?"
A possible alternative for measuring the proportion Roman Catholic in each county was to utilize data published for each county in Churches and Church Membership in the United States (National Council of Churches of Christ in the U.S.A., 1957). For counties in archdioceses and dioceses containing about 53% of the Roman Catholic population of the United States, these Roman Catholic proportions had as their numerator officially reported figures on the number of Roman Catholics as of January 1,1953 and for their denominator the county population from the 1950 census. For counties in the remaining dioceses the figures on Roman Catholic membership were

USE OF PRESENT INDEPENDENT VARIABLES OR THEIR COGNATES IN PREVIOUS STUDIES OF AREAL FERTILITY DIFFERENCES
The level of infant mortality has been shown to be positively associated with fertility in previous multivariate analyses of national fertility differences by Weintraub (1962), by Heer (1966), and by Friedlander and Silver (1967). In the studies conducted by Weintraub and by Heer, infant mortality showed a stronger standardized regression coefficient with respect to fertility than any of the other variables included in the analysis. The study by Collver, Speare, and Liu (1967) of fertility differences among 361 townships in Taiwan showed the crude death rate, with which the level of infant mortality is highly correlated, to have a substantial positive correlation with fertility. A study by Knodel and Van de Walle (1967) of areal fertility differences in nineteenth century Bavaria showed a positive correlation between the level of infant

mortality and marital fertility both within areas where breast-feeding was common and in areas where it was not. Finally, in a multivariate study of the association between death rates and birth rates for municipios in Puerto Rico, Schultz (1967) showed, after control for other variables, that both the death rate of the previous year and that of the two years previous were positively associated with the birth rate of the current year; however, the association was considerably stronger with respect to the former than the latter.
The percentage nonwhite has apparently not been previously correlated with fertility in a multivariate analysis. However, a positive zero-order correlation has been demonstrated for the counties of the United States (Kiser, Grabill, Campbell, 1968).
Multivariate studies of national fertility differences by Weintraub (1962), by Adelman (1963), and by Heer (1966) have shown positive partial associations between areal differences in income and in fertility, although the zero-order correlations between these two variables were in all cases negative. The similar study by Friedlander and Silver (1967) showed the same pattern, but only for the developed nations. A study by Russett (1964) on 38 nations showed a slight negative partial association between per-capita gross national product and the birth rate. However, this negative correlation can be substantially discounted because a high income per capita can be automatically associated with low fertility by virtue of the fact that a high-fertility population will have a high ratio of dependents to earners. Of the studies showing a positive regression between national income and fertility level after control for other variables, those by Heer and by Friedlander and Silver appropriately defined income as income per adult rather than per capita.
The study by Hathaway, Beegle, and Bryant (1969) of components by residence

and color of the population of United States counties by region provides 18 different tests of the association between family income and fertility, holding constant other variables including female income and the proportion of females 14 and over who are employed. Family income was positively associated with fertility in 7 cases and negatively associated in 11 cases. In all three comparisons for the United States as a whole, the multivariate relation between family income and fertility was positive; on the other hand, the within-region associations were mainly negative.
Educational level, literacy, and similar variables have consistently been found to correlate negatively with fertility in most but not all previous studies. With respect to fertility differences between nations, Adelman(1963), Heer (1966), and Friedlander and Silver (1967) found measures relating to educational attainment to be inversely related to fertility after statistical control for other factors. In studies with subnational units as the unit of analysis, similar negative correlations between educational attainment and fertility were found for Taiwan (Collver, Speare and Liu, 1967) and Puerto Rico (Schultz, 1967). In their study of components of the population of United States counties, Hathaway, Beegle, and Bryant (1969) found education to be negatively associated with fertility in 16 of 18 possible cases. For ethnic groups within the Soviet Union, Mazur (1967) also showed a negative partial association between a measure of educational attainment and fertility.
On the other hand, in their study of subnational fertility differences in Latin American nations, Heer and Turner found a somewhat confusing situation. Holding constant the local proportion literate and other variables, they found the national proportion literate to be positively correlated with fertility. Other inconsistent results were obtained by Leasure (1963) in his study of Spanish provinces. He found a slight nega-

relation for a sample of 38 nations after a control for several variables indicating the level of socioeconomic development. No previous study of areal variations in United States fertility has included proportion Roman Catholic as a variable.
SELECTION OF SAMPLE
The universe for the present study consisted of 3,134 counties (or county equivalents) in the United States. From these, a one-in-five sample was selected by combining two one-in-ten systematic samples each having a different random starting point. From this sample of counties further exclusions were made for two reasons. First, counties were excluded if according to the 1960 census 10% or more of their total population was living in group quarters. Such counties were excluded because there was a high probability that the characteristics for the population of the county as a whole would be unduly influenced by the characteristics of its population in group quarters. Secondly, counties were excluded if all of the pertinent data were not available. In the original sample of counties, six in Alaska and one in Hawaii were dropped because information on population potential was not available, and one small independent city in Virginia, newly created in 1960, because insufficient information was available to compute reliable measures of fertility and infant mortality. The final sample contained 591 counties.
RESULTS
The mean and standard deviation of each variable together with the matrix of zeroorder correlations are shown in Table 1. Logio of population potential can be seen to have the highest correlation (--0.39) with the standardized fertility ratio. The second most important correlate of fertility is the proportion Roman Catholic in the archdiocese or diocese in which the county is located. (0.30). Only two correlations be-

tween independent variables are substantial: that between median male income and median years of school completed (0.78) and that between proportion nonwhite and infant mortality (0.57). The surprising lack of positive correlation between the Catholic variable and logio of population potential is due in part to the coincidence of very high proportion Catholic and low population potential in southwestern Louisiana, south Texas, and New Mexico.
Table 2 presents the results of the multiple-regression analysis. The two variables of proportion Roman Catholic and logio of population potential are seen to be of much greater importance than the other variables. The contribution to R2 of the first of these two variables is 0.13 and that of the second is 0.11. In other words, the addition of proportion Catholic adds 0.13 to the proportion of variance explained by the seven variables excluding proportion Catholic, while the addition of logio of population potential adds 0.11 to the proportion of variance explained by the seven variables excludingpopulation potential. I t should also be mentioned that the combined contribution to R? of these two variables is 0.27, so that the other six variables in combination explain only 0.08 of the variance.
Other items of information presented in Table 2 are the partial correlation coefficients and the Beta coefficients (standardized regression coefficients). The square of the partial correlation coefficient shows the additional variance explained separately by each variable as a proportion of the variance left unexplained by the remaining variables. The sign of the partial correlation coefficient indicates the direction of association holding constant the other independent variables. The Beta or standardized regression coefficient shows, when all variables are expressed in terms of standard scores, the slope of each independent variable with respect to fertility after control for other variables.

The rank order of importance of variables (judged by the magnitude of their Beta coefficients) is: (1) proportion Roman Catholic in the archdiocese or diocese in which the county is located, (2) logio of population potential, (3) proportion nonwhite, (4) infant mortality, (5) sex ratio, (6) median male income, and (7) median years of school completed.
DISCUSSION
One of the more striking results of the present study when compared to many other studies of areal differences in fertility is the relatively small proportion (35%) of the total variance explainable by the combined total of the eight independent variables.

results are not directly comparable with the present results or those of Schultz because each township or city was weighted by its population prior to computation of the regression equation.)
In the study by Heer and Turner (1965) of Latin America, for which the units were directly below the national level and hence substantially larger in population than United States counties, 44% of the variance in the child-woman ratio was explained by eight independent variables. In Mazur's study of ethnic groups in the Soviet Union, where the units also had on the average substantially higher population than United States counties, 83% of the variance in fertility was explainable by only four variables. Furthermore, all of the studies of

number of patients served by Planned Parenthood clinics in 1960 in the United States was 282,000 (Corsa, 1966) which was less than 3 % of all live births in the nation during that year and perhaps around 6% of all live births in the areas served.
Another unmeasured variable which is probably of some importance is the proportion of the total population of Spanish surname. An analysis of the counties which showed extremely large positive differences between their actual fertility and that predicted by the regression equation revealed several of these to be in Texas, New Mexico, and Colorado bordering on or adjacent to the Rio Grande River, where presumably a high proportion of the population is of Spanish surname.
A third topic which needs further research is the extent to which the obtained Beta coefficients differ from what they would have been if all relevant variables had been accurately included. For example, does the fact that we cannot measure the proportion Roman Catholic in each county bias the measures we obtain for the other independent variables?
Finally, even if we could assume that the obtained Beta coefficients are accurate, we must consider whether they represent the effect of the presumed independent variables upon fertility, whether they may at least in part reflect the effect of the supposed dependent variable upon the independent variables, or whether they result because the presumed independent and the presumed dependent variable are produced by a common cause. Two of the independent variables have observed Beta coefficients which, if accurate, probably overestimate the impact of that variable upon fertility. These are infant mortality and female labor-force participation. In these cases fertility no doubt exerts an influence upon the independent variable in the same direction as the impact of the independent variable upon fertility. There is good evidence

that the level of fertility to some degree directly affects the level of infant mortality since infant mortality varies directly with the mother's parity even after statistical control for other variables (Heady and Morris, 1959). It can also be argued that the achievement of low fertility, however motivated, induces women to enter the labor force.
On the other hand, the observed Beta coefficient for logio of population potential may underestimate the impact of that variable upon fertility since the effect of fertility upon logio of population potential probably is direct, whereas we assume the effect of logio of population potential upon fertility to be inverse.
An accurate Beta coefficient for the association of median male income and fertility also may not correctly reflect the impact of income upon fertility. It is possible, for instance, that a continued level of high fertility in the past would produce not only high fertility in the present but also, by creating pressure of population upon resources, a reduction in level of income. Thus, it may be that the effect of median male income upon fertility is direct even though an accurate Beta coefficient might be slightly negative.
CONCLUSIONS
Two variables, (a) the proportion of Roman Catholics in the archdiocese or diocese to which the county belongs and (i) the logio of the population potential in the county, are found to be the most important in accounting for variation in the age-standardized fertility of United States county populations. There is little reason to doubt that these two variables are causally influential. Previous studies indicate the higher fertility ideals and greater reluctance to practice contraception among Catholics than members of other religious groups (Freedman, Whelpton, and Campbell, 1958; Westoff, Potter, Sagi, Mishler, 1961; Whelpton, Campbell, and Patterson, 1966; Blake,
