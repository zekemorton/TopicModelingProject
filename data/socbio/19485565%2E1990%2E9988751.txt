ABSTRACT: This paper examines the extent to which the traditional practice of sexual abstinence during lactation has broken down among Yoruba women residents in urban areas. The first major finding is that there is a gradual erosion of the tradition, and the dominant factors of modernization are education of the woman and the use of contraception. The second major finding is that the breakdown of postpartum sexual taboos has statistically significant negative consequences on duration of lactation, although the negative impact of woman's education is greater. The third major finding is that duration of breastfeeding reduces birth interval significantly only when it is less than 15 months, and that both durations of breastfeeding and birth intervals have declined over time. The first two findings suggest further reductions in the proportion of women who abstain from sexual relations during lactation and in durations of breastfeeding as more women become more educated. Significant declines in birth intervals may follow soon after.

A common feature in all societies is that women abstain from sexual relations immediately after childbirth, even in the absence of lactation. The physiological condition of women immediately after parturition calls for a period of sexual abstinence. However, abstinence from sexual relations which derives from cultural beliefs is not a common phenomenon in all societies, but is limited to societies where sexual relations during lactation are thought to have detrimental effects on the health of the lactating child. The Yoruba society of Nigeria is one of the usually cited societies where such traditional beliefs have been held for a long period of time (Schoenmaeckers et al., 1981; Caldwell and Caldwell, 1981;Orubuloye, 1981,1987; Adeokun, 1987). Some of these studies noted that sexual abstinence was traditionally achieved through means that include physical separation between the

nursing mother and her husband (Orubuloye, 1981, Caldwell and Caldwell, 1977; Adeokun, 1987).
Changes have taken place in many traditional values and practices in the course of modernization, and it is unlikely that the culturally rooted abstinence from sexual relations during lactation will be an exception. In fact, some studies have suggested the onset of a break from the traditional practice (Caldwell and Caldwell, 1981; Orubuloye, 1987). This paper, therefore, examines the present level of departure from the traditional practice of sexual abstinence during lactation aswell as the factors that facilitate the break from the traditional norms. The impact of the break from the traditional postpartum sexual norms on duration of lactation will also be examined by determining whether durations of lactation differ significantly between women who expe-

rience sexual relations during lactation and those who abstain from sexual relations throughout the lactation period. It shall also be determined whether duration of lactation has any significant impact on childspacing.
Although the impact of breastfeeding in reducing fertility and child mortality is widely known (see for instance Simpson-Hebert and Huffman, 1981), the primary purpose of breastfeeding in all societies is child nourishment (Nag, 1983). The significance of breast milk as an important component of infant and child nutrition may be greater, however, in many poor less developed countries that lack adequate food substitutes. The protein-deficient staples of many less developed countries are often inadequate to serve as appropriate substitutes for breast milk (Whiting, 1964; Orubuloye, 1987). In addition, traditional weaning foods are usually not in an appropriate form for infants, and breastmilk substitutes are too expensive where and when available and are often mixed with dirty water. Mothers in many African countries usually appreciate the nutritional value of breast milk for the growth of their children, and this appreciation underlies the usually long period of lactation.
As in other African societies, breast milk is perceived to be pure and good for the growth of the child by the Yoruba people. The desire to feed the child with uncontaminated breast milk has given rise to the taboo against sexual relations during lactation. The principal belief underlying the sex taboo is that the mother's milk can be poisoned by semen if sexual relations take place during lactation. Such "poisoned milk" is thought to endanger the health of the nursing child (Orubuloye, 1981, 1987; Schoenmackers et al., 1981; Caldwell

and Caldwell, 1981; Adeokun, 1987). Duration of lactation of about 2.5 years was common in the traditional Yoruba society (Talbot, 1926).
Studies among the Yoruba have usually noted a high degree of adherence to the cultural taboos against sexual relations during lactation with the consequence that the period of sexual abstinence is generally equal to or longer than the duration of breastfeeding (Schoenmackers et al., 1981; Whiting, 1964; Saucier, 1972; Matthews, 1955; Caldwell and Caldwell, 1977,1981). It is only among a small proportion of the population that the mean durations of lactation and postpartum sexual abstinence are equal. Duration of postnatal abstinence of about three years has been recorded for the traditional Yoruba society (Talbot, 1926).
As noted earlier, there have been recent indications of a significant departure from the traditional practice of postpartum sexual abstinence, especially in the urban areas. On the basis of the results of their studies among the Yoruba, Caldwell and Caldwell (1981, pp. 181-182) suggested three stages in the reduction of postpartum sexual abstinence. The Caldwells' findings together with those of Orubuloye (1981) suggest that a breakdown of the postpartum sexual abstinence taboos can be expected as greater proportions of the population become more educated and more people live away from the traditional family settings where deviations from the norms are condemned.

August 1987 and August 1988 in nine Nigerian cities. The cities are: Abeokuta, Akure, and Ibadan (SouthWest); Enugu, Owerri, and PortHarcourt (South-East); Jos, Kano, and Zaria (North). It is the first national survey on indices of women's status and fertility covering all the major ethnic groups in Nigeria, and 10,340 evermarried women between the ages of 15 and 49 years in selected households were interviewed.
Information was collected through formal interviewing. The interview schedule contained questions on: women's perceptions of their roles within marriage, premarital sexual relations, premarital and postmarital use of contraception, pregnancies and their outcomes, desired and achieved family size, childrearing practices, sexual relations during lactation, duration of lactation, birth interval, age and forms of marriage, religion, ethnic group, education before and after marriage, employment history and some other socioeconomic characteristics of the woman, of her husband, and of her parents. In addition, two sections of the interview schedule were devoted to collecting information on the characteristics of members of the household and on births and deaths in the household in the twelve months preceding the survey.
Internal consistency checks and other methods of evaluating the consistency of demographic data suggest that the data are generally of good quality.1 In addition, results from the survey were compared with those from the 1981/82 Nigerian Fertility Survey. The results from this survey are consistent with those from the Nigerian Fertility Survey.
1For more details on sample selection and means of ensuring good quality data, see Feyisetan and Pebley (1989).

There were, unfortunately no questions on sexual relations during lactation in the Nigerian Fertility Survey.
The analysis presented in this paper is based on data on Yoruba women with at least two, and at most seven, births all of which are living at the time of the survey. A minimum of two births is needed to guarantee a closed interval during which a child was weaned. The choice of a maximum of seven births is necessitated by the fact that because only an insignificant proportion of the population had more than seven births, the questionnaire coding format was designed to accommodate information on the duration of breastfeeding of each child and the interval between successive births up to a maximum of seven births. The requirement of a minimum of two births implies that a woman whose duration of marriage is less than five years can be selected only if she has short birth intervals. A selection bias is thus introduced into the analysis of birth intervals if such women are included. This group of women has therefore been excluded.
The restriction to women with all births surviving at the time of the survey is necessitated by limitations of the data and the desire to include respondents with fairly accurate data on both the duration of lactation and birth interval. The birth interval in which a child died was not recorded. In addition, durations of lactation were not reported for many dead children. Where they were reported, it could not be determined if those durations coincided with ages at death which were also not reported for many dead children. Women with all births surviving are no doubt a very select group of people. Yoruba women, usually with limited child survival strategies, adopt long birth intervals to ensure the survival of their children. Women

with all births surviving may, therefore, be those with more and better childcare alternatives.2
Although there is adequate information on durations of breastfeeding for each child, and the interval between successive births, up to a maximum of seven births, the results presented in this paper pertain to the last closed interval. Data on duration of breastfeeding for the open interval are inadequate since women were not asked whether they were still breastfeeding at the time of the survey. Preliminary analyses show that average durations of breastfeeding and birth intervals show little variation by births. Consequently different analyses for individual births give results that are similar to the ones presented here. Data from closed intervals (particularly from the last closed interval) tend to underestimate average durations per woman, particularly for younger women (Lesthaeghe et al., 1981). In order to reduce the bias, this analysis has been restricted to women aged 20 years and above who have been married for five or more years.
It is noted that the data on durations of breastfeeding show some heaping at multiples of three months. Preliminary examinations, including the use of the approach described in Lesthaeghe and Page (1980), however, show that the amount of heaping does not render in-
2Several cases were excluded from this analysis because of the restrictions. There are 3,754 Yoruba women with adequate information on all the variables examined in this paper. Of this number, 3,134 had between 2 and 7 livebirths, 530 had either 1 or no livebirth, and 90 had more than seven livebirths. Of the 3,134 women with 2 to 7 livebirths, 2,665 had all their children surviving at the time of the survey, and of the latter, 2,340 had been married for five or more years. The analysis in this paper is therefore based on data on 2,340 women. This represents about 75 per cent of all women with 2 or more livebirths.

adequate the use of arithmetic means for this analysis. In addition, the changes over time and the differences between groups of women are not concealed by the heaping. The data on birth interval also show some heaping on multiples of six months.
METHODS OFANALYSIS
The principal methods of analysis are the logistic and the dummy variable regression procedures. The logistic regression procedure was used to examine the influence of several variables on a dichotomous dependent variable: whether or not a woman usually has sexual relations during lactation. The coefficients of the logistic regression procedure were later converted into probabilities, and these are denoted as adjusted proportions in Table 2. The dummy variable regression procedure was used to examine the influence of some binary independent variables on each of two interval-level dependent variables: average duration of lactation and mean birth interval both of which are measured in months. Some of the independent variables measured by intervals were transformed into binary variables because earlier investigations showed a nonlinear relationship between them and the dependent variables. The coefficients of the dummy regression analyses were also transformed into actual means; these means are denoted as adjusted durations and intervals in Tables 6 and 8 respectively.3
The independent variables are: education of woman before marriage, the use of contraception, working status, place of birth, religion, duration of marriage, most of which were found to be

The primary/modern category consists of two groups of women: women who only completed the primary education program and those who in addition to the primary education program also completed a three-year post-

ods. With respect to working status, a woman is classified as working in the formal sector if she is either an employer or an employee of a private or public enterprise. She is a worker in the informal sector if she is either an own account worker, an unpaid family worker, or a farm worker.

western part of Nigeria. The modern school curriculum is much closer to that of the primary school than to that of the secondary school; hence women with modern-school education have been merged with those with primary-school education. In addition to similarity in curriculum, the two groups of women exhibit similar patterns of behavior. The secondary category includes some women who completed a program for primary school teachers. The postsecondary category consists of all degree and nondegree programs after the secondary education.

The respondents were asked the question: "Do you usually have sexual relations during lactation?" Tables 1 and 2 show proportions of women who responded "yes" to the question.
Before relating sexual behavior during lactation to socioeconomic characteristics, we attempted first to determine whether there has been a change in adherence to the traditional postpartum sex taboos in the twenty years preceding the survey. An examination of trend is limited to the twenty years preceding the survey for lack of adequate data to go beyond that period. To examine the

The decision to examine the impact of husband's characteristics on the likelihood that the spouse would experience sexual relations during lactation was motivated by the realization that a woman can break a traditional postpartum sex taboo only if her husband was similarly disposed. Of the three characteristics of the husbands examined (age, education, and religion), only education (and only at the post-secondary level) has an independent impact on the likelihood that the spouse would experience sexual relations during lactation. Husband's religion has not been included in the regression equation because of its high correlation with the wife's religion.

For instance, while first births who were weaned between 15 and 19 years before the survey were breastfed for about 12 months, those who were weaned within the four years preceding the survey were breastfed for about 10 months. The same pattern is true for the second, third, and the fifth births. In addition to the general pattern, Table 3 also shows that women who usually experience sexual relations during lactation have always had shorter durations of breastfeeding than those who usually abstain from sexual relations throughout the entire period of lactation. The two groups of women, however, experience declines in durations of lactation over

during lactation and several other characteristics of the women. Two features are discernible from the unadjusted durations presented in Table 5. First, as observed in Table 3, durations of lactation are generally longer for women who abstain from sexual relations during the entire period of lactation; this observation is true at every level of the variables under consideration. Secondly, within each group andfor the two groups combined, duration of lactation varies according to levels of each variable.
The adjusted durations in Panel 1of Table 6 also indicate a shorter duration of lactation among women who resume sexual relations before the lactating child is weaned. Their average duration of lactation is 1.4 months shorter than that for women whoabstain from sexual relations during the entire period oflactation. Adjustment for other factors has, however, reduced the impact of sexual relations during lactation by almost half.
In examining the impact of resuming sexual relations during lactation on duration of breastfeeding, we controlled some variables that are found to influence either the likelihood of experiencing sexual relations before a child is weaned or duration of lactation. The controlled variables are shown in Panels 2 to 8 of Table 6. Since discussion of the impact of these variables on duration of lactation is not of primary concern in this paper, only a brief description ofsalient findings is undertaken.
The controlled variables have varying degrees of impact on duration oflactation. The figures in Panel 3 suggest a more general acceptance of shorter durations of lactation asa norm rather than an exception by younger marriage cohorts. Mothers with fewer than 15years

of marriage have shorter durations of lactation than their counterparts with 20 or more years of marriage. Education has a significant negative impact in spite of the fact that variables through which it can be hypothesized to influence duration of lactation (for example, working status of mothers and use of contraception) areincluded in the equation (Panel
4). Women whohave used only efficient
methods of contraception and those who have used both efficient and inefficient methods have considerably shorter durations of lactation than those who have never used any method of contraception (Panel 5), Unlike working mothers in the informal sector who can take their children to their place of \vbrk and breastfeed them there (if place ófworK.is separated from the home), thé structure of formal sector activities makes" it impossible for mothers who work in that sector to do the same. The shorter duration of lactation among mothers who work in the formal sector (Panel 6) may, therefore, reflect theincompatibility between long intensive breastfeeding and working in the formal sector. Level of traditionality and, by implication, adherence to traditional values is captured in part by religion. Mothers of Islamic faith are found toadhere more to the traditional practice of long duration of lactation (Panel 7).
CHILD SPACING AND SOCIOECONOMIC
FACTORS
Preliminary examinations also show that birth intervals have declined moderately in thetwenty years precedingthe survey. Women who resume sexual relations before weaning are also found to have shorter birth intervals during each of the four time periods identified. Attempts were, therefore, made to deter-

mine if resumption of sexual relations and durations of breastfeeding during lactation have significant impact on birth interval.
Unadjusted mean birth intervals (last closed intervals) are presented in Table 7 according to whether or not mothers had sexual relations during lactation, by durations of breastfeeding and by other socioeconomic characteristics. It is observed that: (1) average birth interval is generally longer among women who abstain from sexual relations during lactation; and (2) within each group and for all women, variations in birth intervals across levels of education, use of contraception, working status, religion, and migrant status appear very minimal, while for other variables, the variations appear substantial.
Adjusted figures in Table 8 indicate that only two variables have statistically significant "net" impact on birth interval. These variables are duration of breastfeeding and duration of marriage. Birth interval differentials in actual months by levels of these variables are, however, not substantial. The statistically insignificant "net" influence of experiencing sexual relations during lactation on the length of interval between successive births is expected. Its impact on birth interval is expected to decline once duration of lactation through which it is expected to influence birth interval is controlled.
Figures in Panel 2 of Table 8 show significant birth interval differentials only between women who breastfeed for any duration less than 15 months and those who breastfeed for 15 or more months. For all durations of breastfeeding less than 15 months, there are no significant birth interval differentials. Also, women who have been married for less than 15 years have significantly

shorter mean birth intervals than women who have been married for 20 or more years. In addition to indicating declines in birth intervals over time, shorter birth intervals among women who have been married for less than 15 years may reflect the fact that they are more fecund than those whose marriages have lasted for 20 or more years and hence are more likely to be pregnant sooner after a birth.
Education of the women and the use of contraception have no significant "net" impact on birth interval. Their impact was found to be minimal even before other variables were controlled. It is possible that there is a normative minimum birth interval which women in the society, irrespective of education or contraceptive adoption, aim at attaining.
DISCUSSION
In this paper, the extent to which the traditional practice of sexual abstinence during lactation has broken down among Yoruba women resident in the urban areas was examined. In addition, the consequences of the break in the traditional postpartum sexual abstinence norms on duration of lactation as well as those of changes in duration of lactation on birth interval were also examined. Three major findings are particularly noteworthy.
The first major finding is that there is a gradual erosion of the traditional norms surrounding sexual relations during breastfeeding and that education of the woman and the use of contraception are the dominant factors of modernization that have facilitated the departure from the traditional practice. Education, especially at secondary and tertiary levels, has often been seen as a measure

of Westernization (see for instance, Lesthaeghe et al., 1981). Apart from widening women's horizon, education facilitates the development of more rational views about situations or phenomena. The results, therefore, confirm the expectation that more educated women, who are more likely to realize that the belief system underlying the postpartum sexual taboos has no rational base, will be less likely to adhere to traditional postpartum sex taboos.
The significant relationship between the use of efficient contraception and the likelihood of experiencing sexual relations during lactation can be explained in two ways. On the one hand, it may be that women who resume sexual relations during lactation are more likely to use contraception to avoid becoming pregnant too early after a birth. On the other hand, it may be that women who normally use contraception between births are more disposed to early resumption of sexual relations since they feel that they are less likely to become pregnant from such sexual acts.
The second major finding is that the breakdown of the postpartum sexual taboos has statistically significant negative consequences on duration of lactation. However, the negative impact of education (one of the major determinants of the breakdown of the traditional sex taboo) is greater. Three explanations can be proffered for the shorter duration of lactation observed among women who resume sexual relations during lactation. First, it is possible that women who experience sexual relations during lactation are also the ones who prefer not to breastfeed for long durations. Second, it may be that these women still believe partially that sexual relations during lactation is harmful to the child, and thus breastfeeding is terminated soon after

the resumption of sexual relations to avert the perceived negative consequences. Third, early pregnancies among some mothers who experience sexual relations during lactation may force them to terminate lactation. The fear of becoming pregnant again and consequently of cutting off milk supply to the child is probably one of the reasons why noncontracepting women abstain for a longer period than contracepting women.
The strong net negative impact of education on duration of lactation can only be attributed to factors not yet controlled for. One such factor is a wider use of powdered milk as a substitute for breast milk by more educated women. Another factor is that more educated mothers may not see the need for a prolonged duration of breastfeeding.
The third major finding is that duration of breastfeeding reduces birth interval significantly only when it is less than 15 months and that both durations of breastfeeding and birth intervals have declined over time.
The first two major findings suggest further reductions in the proportions of women who abstain from sexual relations during lactation and in durations of breastfeeding as more women become more educated and possess the attitudinal and socioeconomic attributes associated with higher levels of education. Significant declines in birth intervals may follow soon after.
A collapse of the postpartum sex taboo is not an important policy issue in itself. It is the impact of the collapse on duration of breastfeeding in a society where costs of substitutes for breast milk are beyond the reach of many families that is of policy relevance. Until adequate substitutes are available, are obtainable at affordable prices, and are

Once socioeconomic attributes have been controlled, shorter durations of breastfeeding among women who have sexual relations during lactation can only be caused by attitudinal factors that can more easily be manipulated.

pattern seems inevitable, there is need for more public education to correct the erroneous ideas that breast milk is poisoned by semen. Durations of lactation are already declining under the influence of modernization factors at a time when adequate substitutes are either not available or are too expensive where available. There is no need to allow attitudinal factors that can be avoided to increase the rate of decline.

Unlike an earlier finding (Lesthaege et al., 1981), users of efficient contraception are not found to have longer birth intervals than those who do not use contraception. A plausible reason for this is that many women use contraception only to prevent becoming pregnant too soon after the last birth. Such women use contraception only to attain a normative minimum interval.

Declines in duration of breastfeeding may eventually lead to a shortening of birth intervals especially through declines in duration of amenorrhea.4 The birth interval difference between
