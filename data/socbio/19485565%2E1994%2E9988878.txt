ABSTRACT: Although fertility declines have taken place in several Arab countries, the Arab nations are growing rapidly. In Saudi Arabia, the total fertility rate (TFR) is 7.1, and the growth rate is 3.5 per cent per year, among the highest in the world. This research examines the structural determinants (indirect indicators) of fertility attitudes and behavior among Saudi Arabian students studying in American universities. Specifically, this study examined the relationship between fertility attitudes and behavior, and background characteristics which included age, religiosity, education, income, length of stay in the U.S., and wife's age and wife's education. Results indicate a highly significant effect of religiosity as a major positive determinant of fertility attitudes. However, the major determinant of fertility behavior, the number of children respondents had, was wife's education which was negatively related with family size.

Fertility rates have either started to decline or have undergone sustained decline in many Latin American and Asian nations, although the rate of increase in population growth is comparatively high (Stycos, 1989). This decline has taken place both in nations which have and have not experienced sustained economic development. However, education and economic development appear to be the most important factors that led to the decline.
The fertility rate in Arab countries is among the highest in the world. Although fertility declines have taken place in several Arab countries, the Arab nations are growing rapidly. In Saudi Arabia the total fertility rate (TFR) is 7.1, and the growth rate is 3.5 per cent per year. These rates are among the highest in the world.
Despite the fact that the TFR in Saudi Arabia is comparatively high, according to some sources it is declining (World Population Profile, 1991). Only

recently, couples in Saudi Arabia have been deciding not to have as many children.
The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between fertility attitudes and behavior and background characteristics of Saudi Arabian university students enrolled in U.S. institutions. Specifically, fertility attitudes and behavior were correlated with: age, religiosity, education, income, and the length of stay in the United States. The impetus for this research lies in the fact that Saudi Arabia has one of the highest levels of fertility in the world (TFR 7.1), one of the highest annual rates of natural increase (3.5 per cent), and simultaneously a relatively high GNP per capita (US$ 6,230), and level of education for men and women. Very little is known about fertility attitudes in Islamic countries. High fertility and natural increase, and relatively high socioeconomic development indicators, call into question the

relationship between fertility and development. Therefore, it is important to investigate this relationship including the very strong cultural factor of religiosity.
BACKGROUND
Both Demographic Transition Theory, and Wealth Flows Theory (Caldwell, 1982), emphasize the importance of socioeconomic development as the key factor leading to fertility decline. To date, neither Transition Theory nor Wealth Flows Theory seem to account for the demographic situation in Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia has experienced significant economic growth and development over the past three decades without a commensurate decline in fertility. Therefore, it is possible that the lag between the aspects of development and fertility have not yet emerged, or a new and different approach to understanding the Saudi situation is needed.
This study focuses on male fertility attitudes and behavior since in some, or perhaps many, cultures in developing nations, men usually tend to make family size decisions and decisions on the use of contraception (Mbizvo and Adamchak, 1991; Khalifa, 1988).
The relationships between socioeconomic and cultural factors and fertility attitudes have been examined by a number of researchers. Religiosity has a strong influence on fertility. Al-Said (1988) and Nagi (1983) found that the level of religiosity is positively correlated with fertility attitudes and behavior. Caldwell (1980) and Dhindsa (1986) argued that education, as a socioeconomic factor, tends to have a negative influence on fertility. As the

education of both males and females increases, age at marriage increases. Also, people with higher education tend to be more concerned with children's education which might lead parents to change their attitudes toward family size. Income appears to be negatively associated with fertility (Briquets and Perez, 1982; Freedman and Thornton, 1982). The length of exposure to different cultural and socioeconomic conditions has been assessed by Friedland et al. (1980), Adamchak and Adebayo (1987), and Adebayo and Adamchak (1991). It was found that students who have been exposed to Western education and live in a different cultural and social environment may have the desire for a smaller family size.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
DATA
All male Saudi students who are sponsored by the Saudi Education Mission (SEM) are the population of the study. The total population, according to SEM, is almost 2,000 male students, distributed randomly in many American academic institutions. Nearly all Saudi students are sponsored by SEM.
Cluster sample design was used to select 622 male students from all institutions that have 15 or more male Saudi students enrolled. SEM agreed to provide a letter of consent and a telephone number and address of one Saudi student in each location for personal contact. This individual was contacted as the key person to distribute the questionnaire in each location with 15 or more Saudi students. The response rate was 45 per cent representing 279 individuals.

VARIABLES
The dependent variables of this study are the fertility attitudes and behavior of male Saudi students. Fertility attitudes were measured by ideal family size for the total sample and its married and single components. In addition, for those who were married, desired number of children and actual number of children were used as dependent variables.
The independent variables are age, religiosity, level of education, economic background, and length of stay in the United States when ideal family size was the dependent variable. In the models where desired number of children and actual number of children were the dependent variables, wife's age and education were included as independent variables.
Religiosity is an important element determining perception of fertility attitudes. Religiosity was measured by asking respondents several questions concerning the importance of their participation and actions toward some religious activities. To gain a more exact measurement of religiosity, four questions were combined into one index. They include the importance of religion compared to other forces, the strength of religious beliefs, how often respondents recite Quran, and how many times respondents perform prayers in the Mosque. The answer to each question was divided into four categories resulting in sixteen categories as follows:
1. The importance of religion --Very Important = 3 --Important = 2 --Somewhat Important = 1 --Not Important = 0

2. The strength of religious beliefs --Strong Influence = 3 --Fairly Strong Influence = 2 --Somewhat Important = 1 --No Influence = 0
3. How often respondents recite Quran --Every Day = 3 --2-6 times a week = 2 --Once a week = 1 -Other (Hardly or Never) = 0
4. How often respondents perform prayer in the Mosque --Over 7 times a week = 3 --2-6 times a week = 2 --Once a week = 1 -Other (Hardly or Never) = 0
The highest score of the religious index that a respondent could obtain is 12 while the lowest is 0. To obtain a value from 0.0 to 1.0, the value of each category was added and then divided by 12 to obtain an average. For example, a respondent is considered very religious if he has a score of 1.0.
Education appears in many studies as an important factor of fertility. This variable was measured by asking the respondent about the number of years he and his wife (if married) have spent in formal education.
Economic background is viewed as an important factor in shaping fertility behavior. The level of subject's income was excluded since all Saudi students sponsored by SEM receive the same amount of money each month. Therefore, the income level of respondents' families was used. Family income was logged to correct for skewness.
In order to evaluate the strength of the relationship between education, religiosity, and income with fertility attitudes and behavior, we needed to control for confounding variables. Length of stay in the United States was used as a control variable since it

makes it possible to consider exposure to a different culture. Age of respondent and age of wife (if married) were also used as control variables. Older students have had the opportunity to marry and have children, and therefore, may have different attitudes and behavior patterns toward fertility and family planning.
Multiple regression was performed to test the combined effects of the independent variables upon dependent variables. Multicollinearity was assessed by regressing each independent variable on the other independent variables (Lewis-Beck, 1980). The largest coefficient of multiple determination, R2 was 0.590. Multicollinearity is not considered a problem when R2's are less than 0.8.
RESULTS
Multiple regression was used to examine the relative importance among the independent variables and to test the combined effects of independent variables upon dependent variables. Means and standard deviations of the variables used in the analysis are shown in Table 1.
Table 2 shows the relationship between the dependent variable, ideal family size, and the independent variables for the total sample and the married and single components.
Unstandardized and standardized regression coefficients and their level of significance are shown. The only significant variable was religiosity for the total sample as well as the married and single respondents (total sample: Beta = 0.390; p < 0.01). The more religious the person is, the higher his ideal family size preference, controlling on all other variables.

Table 3 shows the relationship between two dependent variables (number of children married respondents desire, and the number of children married respondents currently have) and the independent variables including wife's age and wife's education.
The religious index remains positive and significant with desired number of children controlling on all other variables (Beta = 0.408, p< 0.01). There are no other significant relationships. With the other dependent variable, the number of children respondents have, however, there are several significant relationships. Wife's education is negative and significant (Beta =^0.280, p<0.01). As the wife's education increases, the respondent's number of children decreases. This finding reflects the importance of wife's education on fertility decline.
Both respondent's and wife's ages are found to be positively significant with number of children. As age increases for respondents and their wives, the number of children they have increases. This result was expected since the older couples are more likely to have more children than younger couples. Religion, family income, respondents' education, and duration were not significant.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Results indicate a strong influence of the cultural factor, religion, net of other indicators on ideal family size for the total, married, and single respondents. Duration of residence in the United States does not have a significant effect on any of the dependent variables for any subgroup of the sam-

pie. However, there was a negative relationship between duration of residence andideal family size for the total and married component and desired number of children.
Religiosity, as an indirect determinant of fertility, was found to be the most important determinant of fertility attitudes among Saudi students studying in the United States. For married

respondents, religiosity was the only significant indicator net of all other variables to be related (positively) to desired number of children. However, religiosity was not related to fertility behavior as measured by number of children respondents currently have in the regression analysis. Respondent's age and wife's age are positive and significant as expected. Number of

though these factors play an important role indetermining fertility in previous research.
This sample, although it does not represent the entire Saudi society,reflects how important religion is for Saudi people andhow their attitudes are derived from Islamic doctrine regardless of socioeconomic indicators. However, in terms of actual behavior, wife's education emerged as theonly

socioeconomic indicator that has anegative andsignificant relationship with the number of children respondents have, which reflects the importanceof the wife's education in fertility reduction inthis particular Saudi population group. Future research efforts on Saudi Arabians and other Islamic populations will further our understanding of this complex relationship within an Islamic cultural context.
