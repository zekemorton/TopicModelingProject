ABSTRACT: This article provides an analytical account of the variability in and correlates of Brazil's childlessness rates. Following from the socioeconomic development model, which suggests that involuntary childlessness predominates among developing countries and voluntary childlessness among developed countries, this paper examines the extent to which levels of development are related to age-specific rates of childlessness in the states and territories of Brazil. We find both variation within the age-specific childlessness rates and important associations between measures of economic development in 1970 and the rates of childlessness in 1980. Moreover, childlessness in Brazil tends to be more voluntary than involuntary, particularly among the younger women in the more modernized subregions of the country.

Considerable demographic study in past decades has been devoted to analyses of the demographic transition. However, virtually all of the attention has focused primarily on changes in fertility and mortality, with little attention given to changes in childlessness. While the propositions of transition theory do not speak directly to childlessness, many of the factors related to the fertility and mortality transitions should be related to trends in childlessness. Indeed, recent analyses have suggested that the social and economic developmental processes in a country influence voluntary and involuntary childlessness in a way similar to that of fertility (Poston and Trent, 1984; Poston et al., 1985). Other studies have shown that not all women who want children have them and that childlessness rates show substantial variation over time (Veevers, 1972; Poston and Trent, 1982). In this paper we focus on the states and territories of Brazil in 1980 and examine the extent to which

levels of development are related to rates of childlessness.
Brazil is an intriguing country for demographic study. Internationally, it is the fifth largest in land mass and the sixth largest in population size (Population Reference Bureau, 1986). Moreover, it exerts extensive political and economic influence on other countries, particularly those in Latin America. Occupying more than one-half of the South American continent, Brazil is the largest country in South America in population and land mass (Population Reference Bureau, 1986). The Brazilians have been involved in economic, political, and social change for decades. And since the mid 1950's, they have been actively engaged in programs of economic development (Collier's Encyclopedia, 1982, p. 495). Brazil has a higher standard of living than any other Latin American country, save Argentina, although it is still plagued by some economic and political turmoil. Several of Brazil's cit-

ies, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, to cite two, are major cities of industrialization, and very similar to American and European cities. However, there are also states and territories in the northern areas of the country which remain undeveloped socially, economically, and demographically.
In this paper we analyze the relationships between modernization and childlessness among 25 geographical units of Brazil, including 21 states, 3 territories, and the Federal District. We use seven age-specific rates of childlessness computed for 1980 grouped in 5-year intervals. We find both variation within the childlessness rates, as well as important associations between measures of economic development in 1970 and the rates of childlessness in 1980.
We turn next to a review of prior studies of childlessness and their relevance for an analysis of Brazil. Later we develop a theoretical model, discuss the data and methods, and then present our results and discuss their implications.
PRIOR INVESTIGATIONS OF CHILDLESSNESS
Most prior studies of childlessness have focused on the United States and Canada (e.g., the census-based analyses of Grabill and Glick, 1959; Poston and Gotard, 1977; Davis, 1982; Veevers, 1972, and Wolowyna, 1977, among others). In recent years there have been a few studies dealing with other countries. We will review some of these in this section to place in perspective our analysis of childlessness among the states and territories of Brazil.
One recent investigation of international patterns of childlessness focused on 65 developed and developing countries of the world in the circa-1970 per-

iod (Poston and Trent, 1982). The study found rather substantial variation in the phenomenon and also reported patterns of childlessness in the developed countries different from those in the developing countries. Another analysis dealt solely with developing countries and ascertained the degree to which levels of development were associated with rates of childlessness (Poston and Trent, 1984). Hypotheses were set forth expecting negative relationships between childlessness and three components of economic development pertaining to structural development, health conditions, and female status. All found support in the data, with health conditions showing the highest correlation.
Other studies of Zaire (Romaniuk, 1980; Tabutin, 1982), of the James Bay Indians (Romaniuk, 1974), and of Mexico (Poston et al., 1985) have reported similar results, that is, negative associations between levels of development and rates of childlessness. One recent analysis, however, of the hsiens and major cities of Taiwan found positive associations between various measures of modernization and childlessness (Poston et al., 1984). Unlike the countries analyzed in the other childlessness studies just reviewed, Taiwan has been characterized by both considerable economic development since the end of World War II, along with a concomitant fertility decline. Thefindingof a positive association there between levels of development and childlessness suggests the presence of varying although small amounts of voluntary childlessness in the more developed areas on the island.
A recent cross-sectional study of the governorates of the Arab Republic of Egypt found positive associations between measures of modernization and childlessness rates of younger women,

but negative associations between the modernization variables and childlessness rates of older women (Poston and el-Badry, 1987). As with Taiwan, Egypt has also been experiencing economic development, although more recently. Results from the study of Egypt suggest the presence of varying amounts of involuntary childlessness among the older women, and varying, although small, amounts of voluntary childlessness among the younger women, especially among those in the more developed governorates of the country (see also Poston and El-Badry, 1986).
With the exception of the Taiwan and Egypt studies, most other analyses of countries in the developing world may not be that pertinent to an understanding of the association between modernization and childlessness among the states of Brazil in 1980. Apart from the Taiwan analysis, and to some extent that of Egypt, the studies just discussed have shown, for the most part, that childlessness decreases in a population (and fertility increases) during its incipient states of modernization. This occurs because the early development strategies, especially those pertaining to the enhancement of health conditions through the reduction of infectious disease and malnutrition, cause childlessness to decline since it is mainly involuntary, and fertility, as a consequence, to increase. Presumably this was the situation in the countries just reviewed, except in Taiwan, and among younger women in Egypt, and provides a reasonable interpretation of the negative relationships found in those countries between measures of economic development and levels of childlessness.
However, as we know from demographic transition theory, with the continuation of modernization, fertility

eventually begins to decline and continues to do so. Levels of childlessness, which have become quite low, then begin to increase. This increasing childlessness, however, is due to increases in voluntary childlessness. Presumably this was the situation characterizing the association between development and childlessness in Taiwan, and among the younger Egyptian women, as reviewed, and should be applicable, we would argue, for Brazil as well. At this stage both childlessness and fertility should be responding to the various developmental mechanisms, especially those dealing with enhanced educational opportunities for women and increasing rates of female labor force participation. These modernization influences should now result in increases in childlessness and decreases in fertility.
With respect to current conditions in Brazil, the country is not at all a stranger to socioeconomic development. Similar to Taiwan, Brazil has been an active participant in economic development programs for some time. In 1956, the President of Brazil, Juscelino Kubitschek, initiated a number of economic programs, including development of industrial power (electric power plants), and transportation and communication networks (Collier's Encyclopedia, 1982, p. 513). The construction of the present capital, Brasilia, began in 1960 and today stands as a modern city in terms of architecture, planning, and design. Since the mid 1950's, the government has continued to support industrialization, even through periods of economic, political, and military disruption.
Presently, industry is a major source of Brazilian income. The manufacturing industry in 1977 contributed to 23 per cent of the country's gross domestic product (Collier's Encyclopedia, 1982,

270

p. 496). About 20 per cent of Brazil's labor force is in industry. However, industry in Brazil is largely concentrated in the Eastern states. About half of the factories in Brazil are located in the states of Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, and Minas Gerais. Some of the key industries are textiles, food processing, transportation equipment, manufacturing, and fertilizer production. In 1978, Brazil's gross national product ranked tenth among all countries (Kurian, 1982, p. 228).
Therefore, in many ways Brazil may be characterized as currently experiencing the later stages of modernization. The social structure is changing from one of a traditionally agrarian society with strong familial bonds to an urban and industrial society with a heavy dependence on institutions. Nevertheless, there are discontinuities. The states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, as well as the Federal District, are very similar in their overall characteristics, to areas in the United States or Europe. The Federal District, which is almost entirely comprised of the city of Brasilia, is 96 per cent urban. The states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo are 88 and 80 per cent urban, respectively. In contrast, Piaui, a northern state in the undeveloped Amazonian frontier is only 3 per cent urban. Maranhao, a state in the underdeveloped northwest region, is 25 per cent urban. Further, although Brazil is modernized, it still depends heavily on selling raw materials (coffee, iron, sugar) and buying finished products (chemicals, fuels, wheat).
These are important distinctions to make, since despite the variation in socioeconomic development in Brazil, the country clearly has advanced significantly toward full modernization. Given its current stage of development, we are inclined to hypothesize a positive

association between levels of modernization in 1970 and rates of childlessness in 1980 among the states and territories of Brazil.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The childlessness data used in this study are taken from the 1980 census of Brazil (IBGE, 1983). Indicators of economic development have been drawn mainly from the 1970census, the Census Preliminary Reports, and the Statistical Abstract of Brazil, all circa-1970 (IBGE, 1970,1971,1973).
In 1970, as in 1980, Brazil was divided into 27 subregions, including 22 states, 4 territories, and the Federal District. Between 1970 and 1980, however, the composition of several states changed. In 1974, the states of Rio de Janeiro and Guanabara merged, to form the single state of Rio de Janeiro. For comparability between 1970 and 1980, we have merged the data for these two states for 1970 and treat them in both years as one, Rio de Janeiro. Conversely, in 1977, Mato Grosso was split to form the two states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul. For comparability, we have merged the data for the two states for 1980 and treat the two in both periods as the single state of Mato Grosso. One of the territories, Fernando de Noronha, an island off the Northeastern coast, has been excluded because little information for the territory is available. Our study thus involves 25 contiguous states and territories of Brazil, as just defined, and encompasses the entire country, save the Fernando de Noronha island.

found among women in most of the other groups.
Delving further into specific differences among the states, consider the differences between Rio de Janeiro and Amapa (see Table 1). In Rio de Janeiro in 1980, for example, for every 1,000 ever-married women in the 15-19 year age group, 399 were childless, whereas for every 1,000 in the 45-49 year old group, 81 were childless. At the other end of the distribution is Amapa with 321 childless women per 1,000 ever-

married in the group 15-19, and 48 childless women in the 45-49 year old group.
We have graphed in Figure 2 the seven age-specific marital childlessness rates for Rio de Janeiro and Amapa. Observe the rather sizeable differences between the rates for Rio de Janeiro and those for Amapa. At age 15-19, the rates are 0.40 for Rio de Janeiro and 0.32 for Amapa. The differences in rates narrow somewhat as the age groups get older, but even at age 40-44, the differ-

Since the rates are period and not cohort rates, however, this pattern occasionally varies.
Table 2 presents means, standard deviations, and minimum and maximum values for each of the seven marital childlessness rates. The magnitude of the standard deviations confirms the above suggestion about variability in the childlessness rates. Note that as one progresses from the younger to the older age groups, the variability decreases.
INDEPENDENT VARIABLES
The hypothesis guiding this analysis expects a positive relationship between modernization and childlessness in the states of Brazil. In an attempt to set forth the relevant independent variables needed to capture the principal components of the modernization process, we have followed Goldscheider's suggestions that "the key to understanding modernization begins with the process of structural differentiation . . . of major social structures, roles and organization . . . including specialization and separation of economic, family and religious, political and stratification systems" (1971, p. 93). Under ideal conditions of data availability, one would do

well to obtain empirical indicators of all the various modernization dimensions set forth by Goldscheider. Unfortunately, data on the states of Brazil in the circa-1970 time period were not available for all these modernization components. We were able to obtain data on the thirteen following modernization indicators: the average of the two distances from the state's capital to Brasilia and to Rio de Janeiro; electricity consumption; female labor force participation; female college attainment; an indicator of female status measured by the ratio of female to male college attainment; persons per room; rooms per house; female literacy; another indicator of female status measured by the ratio of female to male labor force participation; proportion of the population that is Catholic; an indicator of family size measured by the proportion of families with five individuals; and rates of infectious and maternal mortality. These thirteen variables are listed in Table 3 along with their operational definitions, their average values, standard deviations, and minimum and maximum values.
The anticipated relationships between many of the development indicators and childlessness are rather

straightforward, given the general hypothesis of a positive association between modernization and childlessness. Let us discuss them and the nature of their expected associations with childlessness. All of the modernization variables apply to the year 1970. In our endeavor to account for variation in the 1980 rates of childlessness among the Brazilian subregions, we have lagged the modernization variables by ten years. Following the work of Cutright and Kelly (1978) and Poston and Trent (1984), we are assuming that changes in levels of development and ultimate changes in childlessness require a temporal lag of at least ten years, and even longer for the rates of older women.
We have gathered data on the aver-

age distance (in kilometers) between each state capital and Brasilia and Rio de Janeiro in an attempt to develop a proxy indicator of the influence of these two major Brazilian cities. For each state capital we have taken the average of the sum of the two distances (Brasilia and Rio de Janeiro have each been assigned scores of zero). In the most literal sense of the word, these cities are the centers of activity in the country and exert significant influence of a modernizing nature on the other populations in the country. Thus we expect that the more distant a state capital from these two cities, the less the level of modernization of the state. Hence, the greater the DISTANCE, the less the childlessness rates.

Two variables, persons per room (PROOM) and rooms per house (RHOUSE) are measures of crowding and affluence. The PROOM variable reflects the average degree of crowding in an area and should be negatively associated with modernization; we expect a negative relationship between this measure and childlessness. The RHOUSE is a proxy for the degree of relative affluence in the area and should be positively associated with modernization; we anticipate that this variable will be positively associated with childlessness.

tain to INFECTIOUS and MATERNAL MORTALITY. The lower the mortality rates of a state, the higher its standards of living, and the higher its levels of development; thus, the higher its rates of childlessness. Recall our earlier observations that given the development already in effect in Brazil considerably prior to 1970, most of the variation in childlessness among the 25 areas in 1980 should be due mainly to voluntary childlessness. The associations of these two mortality variables on childlessness in this context are thus expected to be

especially the first configuration, reflects the kind of "nuclear" pattern indicative of areas experiencing the modernization process. The more modernized the area, the greater the proportion of families comprised of five individuals. Thus we would expect a positive association between this variable and childlessness.

Regarding the other modernization variables, we expect positive associations between childlessness and those pertaining to energy consumption; female labor force participation; literacy; female college attainment; and the two female status indicators. We turn now to the results of our inquiry.

same kinds of modernization mechanisms which elicit negative responses in fertility behavior.
It is recalled that we are employing seven age-specific rates of marital childlessness for each of the 25 states and territories for the age groups 15-19,20-24, 25-29, . . . 45-49. Our reasons for using a full schedule of seven rates are two: First, the utilization of seven rates of childlessness will permit us to ascertain the influences of the modernization variables at all stages of the reproductive life cycles of the Brazilian married females from the very youngest to the oldest. Second, given the above argument that much of the variation in childlessness in the Brazilian states is due to voluntary factors, the use of the seven age-specific rates will provide an opportunity to appraise this question indirectly. Voluntary childlessness should be more prominent among the younger ever-married women, particularly those in their 20's, than among, say, the ever-married in their mid-thirty's, because of the timing of modernization and development in Brazil. Much of the evidence cited earlier about economic development in Brazil indicates that the phenomenon has had substantial impact mainly since the end of the mid 1950's. Prior to the mid-1950's, Brazil ranked low on most indicators of social and economic development. Studies of other countries at similar stages of economic development have shown that childlessness under these situations is mainly involuntary (Romaniuk, 1980; Poston et al., 1985), which means that the women in the age groups 35-39,40-44, and 45-49 in 1970 were in their prime reproductive years at a period of time when voluntary childlessness was uncommon. Women in the age groups 25-29 and 30-34 in 1980 are a transitional age group in that a portion

of their main childbearing years was spent during the years when Brazil moved from a developing to a semideveloped country. Accordingly, the childlessness existing among these women should be both voluntary and involuntary. These women should have more voluntary childlessness than the women in their 40's, but less than those in their 20's.
If the above reasoning has merit, the development indicators should have the highest positive correlations with agespecific rates of childlessness for women 20-24 and 25-29. The correlations between development and childlessness should be lower in magnitude among women 30-34 and 35-39 years old, and even lower among the women in their 40's.
Before examining the results of these investigations, we present in Table 4 a zero-order correlation matrix computed for the seven age-specific rates of marital childlessness for the 25 Brazilian units in 1980. Observe that the relationship between any two rates is highest when the rates apply to contiguous age groups, and lowest between rates at the extreme ends of the age distribution. To illustrate, the correlation between the rates for age groups 20-24 and 25-29 is 0.81, that between the childlessness rates for age groups 30-34 and 35-39 is 0.88, and so forth. Conversely, the correlation between the rates computed for age groups 15-19 and 45-49 is 0.29. This matrix shows considerable differences in the levels of age-specific rates of childlessness across the age groups and the states and territories in 1980. The employment of all seven age-specific rates in the examination of the developmentchildlessness relationships will permit even more extensive tests of the hypotheses than if a single rate were used.

Correlations between the seven agespecific childlessness rates with the indicators of modernization are presented in Table 5. Generally, our hypotheses are confirmed. Note that most of the indicators have their highest correlations with childlessness at those ages where voluntary childlessness would be more susceptible to the influences of modernization, that is, women in their early years of reproduction.
The cross-sectional results in Table 5 permit the following generalizations about modernization and childlessness

among the Brazilian states. As distance from the major cities increases, childlessness decreases. Thus, the farther from the modernizing influences of a city, the less the childlessness. Conversely, as energy consumption increases, indicating increasing modernization, childlessness rates increase. Table 5 shows that as people tend toward nuclear families, childlessness increases. We also find that as the number of rooms per house increases, and as the number of people per room decreases, childlessness increases.

Childlessness inBrazil

As females break with traditional society, they generally become more educated, more integrated into the industrial network, gain higher status, and join the work force in larger numbers. This progression leads to higher rates of childlessness, as is borne out in Table 5, where such variables as female labor force participation, literacy, college attainment, and female status in school and employment are all positively related with childlessness.
Our measures of health are also related to modernization. Thus, we would expect that as modernization increases, mortality will decrease, and childlessness will increase. We see this association in maternal mortality and in mortality caused by infectious and parasitic diseases, especially among the younger women. Of these two variables, mortality caused by infectious disease relates most strongly with childlessness.
Our religious variable is a general measure of the strength and pervasiveness of the Catholic church, mediated through modernization, in influencing childbearing. We see a negative relation between per cent of the population Catholic and rates of childlessness. These results allow us to suggest that increased migration and greater interchanges of new ideas tend to reduce the proportion that is Catholic and concomitantly increase the childlessness rates. Therefore, with zero-order correlations, our major hypotheses have been well supported by the data in Table 5 among the Brazilian subregions in 1980. The higher the modernization levels, the higher the childlessness rates.
To analyze our variables beyond the bivariate level, we need to employ regression analysis. However, multiple regression is not appropriate for 25 observations and 13variables, especially since

many of the variables are highly related with each other. Therefore, we will factor analyze our modernization variables and then regress each of the seven childlessness rates on the emerging factor scores. Since the factors will be independent of one another, multicollinearity will no longer be a problem.
The mortality measures are available for only 17 of the 12Brazilian units. Unfortunately, the missing data are not normally distributed among the various states and territories. Indeed, our mortality variables are not available for any of the territories in Brazil, and are also not available for some of the less modernized states. We were only able to include the mortality variables in the zeroorder correlation analyses, and had to exclude them from the regression analyses.1
Using the 11 modernization variables, we performed a principal components factor analysis, using varimax rotation.2 We selected factors with eigen-values greater than 1.0. The factor analysis produced three separate factors, accounting for 83 per cent of the original variance from the 11 variables. The factor analysis results are shown in Table 6.
Factor I is composed of high positive loadings on energy, female college at-
1For those 17 subregions of Brazil with data on all 13 variables, we performed a factor analysis of all 13 variables; we also regressed each of the seven childlessness rates on the factors. Our results showed that the factors separated in about the same way, with similar loadings. Since we did not gain a separate health or mortality factor, did not gain in interpretation, nor in variance explained, but did lose in terms of degrees of freedom, we report in the paper the results of the factor analysisof those 11 variables for which data are available for all 25 subregions.
2These, as well as the other calculations, were analyzed through SAS for personal computers (SAS Institute, Inc., 1985).

tainment and literacy, female status in the labor force, and nuclear families, and a high negative loading on the religious variable. The factor accounts for 56per cent of the variance from the original 11 variables. These variables tap various dimensions of structural and cultural modernization.
Factor II contains a high positive loading on the distance variables, indicating the influence of major industrial, political, and economic centers. This factor positively loads on people per room and negatively loads on rooms per house. This dimension represented by Factor II indicates the affluence and the influence of an area. This factor accounts for 16per cent of the original variance.
Factor III is characterized by high positive loadings on female labor force participation and the status of females attaining college degrees. Moreover, there is a high positive secondary loading on this factor for the variable reflecting the status of women in the work force. This factor, which explains 11per cent of the original variance, has been identified as a female status factor.

We can now regress each of the childlessness rates on these three factors in an attempt to ascertain which of the factors best predicts or explains childlessness among the subregions of Brazil.
Table 7 presents the seven regressions of the three factors on each childlessness age group. The models all fit well, with adjusted R2's ranging from 0.252 to 0.664.
Factor I follows the pattern we predicted, except for the first age group. As modernization increases, the structural and cultural effects on childlessness increase. The modernization factors are strongest for the 20-24 and 25-29 year age groups. Observe that there is a negative relation between modernization and childlessness in the older age groups. This finding implies, as expected, a higher degree of involuntary childlessness, especially between the 40-44 and 45-49 year old women.
Factor II follows a classic pattern of the impact of influence/affluence on childlessness. Factor II exhibits strong negative associations with childlessness among women in the younger age groups. As mother's age increases, Fac-

Women in early childbearing years are now in the position to make use of modernization features and their influences on voluntary childlessness.

we found that among the subregions of Brazil in 1980, childlessness and levels of modernization were positively related, especially among younger women. This suggests the presence of varying amounts of voluntary childlessness among these younger women. Given this finding, we expect that as fertility continues to decline in Brazil, these reductions should be accompanied by further increases in the country in voluntary childlessness.
