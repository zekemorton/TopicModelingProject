ABSTRACT: Three hypotheses interpret differences in human fertility among religious groups. The Particularistic Theology Hypothesis stresses the pronatalist influence of doctrines forbidding artificial contraception and emphasizing the importance of sons, while the Characteristics Hypothesis focuses on the antinatalist effect of urban residence, higher education, and late age at marriage. But the Minority Status Hypothesis argues that such antinatalist effects may be stronger for a minority than a majority, since better-educated, late-marrying urbanites have greater chances for upward mobility. Minority groups with these advantages may have much lower fertility than similar people in the majority group if antinatalism is seen as a way to counter prejudice and move up. I tested these three hypotheses with data from the 1981 Census of India, from which I calculated mean numbers of children ever born per wife aged 35-44. I standardized the mean for differences between Hindu and Christian women by urban residence, education, age, and length of marriage. The standardized fertility rates of Hindus and Christians were similar in 25 states/union territories. Only in Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Nagaland did the Hindu religious minority have a lower standardized birth rate than the Christian majority; but the Muslim minority had one like the Christians'. This pattern was most consistent with the Characteristics Hypothesis.

Most demographic studies have used one of three approaches to associate religion with human fertility. The first, the "Particularistic Theology Hypothesis," holds that special theological tenets about family size, abortion, or acceptable contraception directly govern human fertility (Goldscheider, 1971, p. 273). For instance, the Roman Catholic Church teaches that the purpose of marriage is reproduction and that artificial contraception and abortion violate divine will. Since most Protestant churches have no proscriptions against artificial contraception and abortion, the Particularistic Theology Hypothesis would predict higher fertility for Roman Catholics than Protestants.
Like Roman Catholics, Hindus have a pronatalist theology. Hinduism imparts greater religious significance

to a son than to a daughter, since only the son (or his male deputy) can release the parent's spirit from the body at death by presiding at the funeral rites. However, since about 11 million of the 16.17 million Christians in India in the early 1980's were Protestants (Benderly, 1985, p. 172), the Christian patterns of fertility were dominated by Protestant reproductive behavior. As such, the Particularistic Theology Hypothesis would predict higher fertility for Hindus than Christians in India and would explain it by the stronger attempts by Hindus to bear sons. A logical implication is that secularism will lessen the differences in fertility within the Christian community and between Christians and Hindus.
Another approach, the "Characteristics Hypothesis," emphasizes the role that economic and demographic

factors play in creating reproductive differences among social groups. For example, in comparison to the Hindus, the Christian population of India is composed of larger proportions of people who are urban, highly educated, and first married at ages over 20 (Roy, 1989; Schermerhorn, 1978). As such, if Christians do have a lower rate of fertility than Hindus, the Characteristics Hypothesis would assign its cause only to these differences in population composition. This explanation implies that Christian and Hindu women with the same residence, education, and age at marriage should have the same rate of fertility and denies that religious theology or membership in a socially salient minority group could exert a separate influence on reproductive behavior.
The "Minority Status Hypothesis" does not deny the importance of religious doctrines or social and demographic factors in producing racial and religious differences in fertility; but it departs from the other two hypotheses in attributing a causal role to the discrimination experienced by members of a minority group. For example, Goldscheider noted that Jewish fertility has been markedly below that of Protestants and Catholics in the United States since the 1880's. This Jewish antinatalism can be explained neither by the Particularistic Theology Hypothesis nor by the Characteristics Hypothesis, since Jews have no religious ideology prescribing fewer children and since they maintain persistently lower fertility when compared to Protestants and Catholics of similar metropolitan status and social class. Likewise, he found that U.S. black women with at

least a high-school diploma and in the later ages of childbearing had lower cumulative fertility than did white women of identical education and age. Goldscheider concluded that Jews and better-educated blacks had lower fertility partly to make up for religious and racial prejudice that hampered their pursuit of upward socioeconomic mobility.
From these North American examples, Goldscheider generalized that when privileged members of a powerful religious or racial majority group impose social segregation even on those members of a minority group who have become economically similar to them through upward mobility, then the latter may suffer greater economic insecurities. This formulation implicitly assumes that economic insecurities lower the minority's perceived benefits of children. Indeed, in institutional contexts where elite members of the majority group control access to coveted material resources, then having many children may confer few advantages to minority parents in acquiring wealth. Once minority couples have scaled discriminatory barriers and reached a desired level of socioeconomic status, then moderate or high fertility should appear still more expensive to them, if they are to establish all their children on a level no worse than their own. In other words, the cost-benefit assessment of the value of children is likely to define them as a greater deterrence against upward social mobility or retention of high social status by minority than majority subpopulations and, as a result, should motivate successful minorities to have fewer children than their majority

peers (Goldscheider, 1971; Goldscheider and Uhlenberg, 1969). The implication is that despite secularization or mobility into the upper class, the religious or racial minority will remain reproductively distinctive if the majority group can still threaten its access to coveted material resources. This threat would be signalled by a sustained social segregation imposed by elite members of a religious or racial majority group upon elite members of a minority group.
The three hypotheses have been tested with data on religious and racial minorities in Canada, the United States, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. Canadian examples are Halli (1987) and Trovato (1987). U.S. examples include Bean and Swicegood (1985), Cooney et al. (1981), Jiobu and Marshall (1977), Johnson (1979), Johnson and Lean (1985), Johnson and Nishida (1980), Ritchey (1975), and Roberts and Lee (1974). For European illustrations, consult Coward (1980) and Kennedy (1973). Cases from Australia and New Zealand can be found in Day (1968). Day held that religious differences in fertility were unlikely to be large or substantively important in societies lacking a high degree of contraceptive prevalence. Perhaps for this reason, few tests of the three hypotheses have been conducted with data on minorities in Lesser Developed Countries (LDC's).
An exception is a study of Filipino college and university students which found that Protestants, in contrast to Catholics, wanted fewer children, more often said that marital contraception should start before the first birth, and less often opposed artificial contra-

ception as controverting divine will (Johnson and Burton, 1987). These relationships are congruent with the Particularistic Theology Hypothesis.
A second exception is a study offive ethnic minority groups in Liberia, whose fertility was found not to differ much from that of the ethnic majority group (Americo-Liberians) after such characteristics as women's work status, education, rural-urban residence, and marital status had been statistically controlled (Kollehlon, 1989). The results for Liberia are consistent with the Characteristics Hypothesis.
Thirdly, when a multiple regression had statistically controlled such characteristics as wife's age at marriage, duration of marriage, rural-urban residence, education, and work status, there was a significantly smaller net number of children ever born per wife among the Christian, Hindu, and Muslim minorities than to the Buddhist majority in Sri Lanka and to the Indian-Hindu and Chinese-Buddhist minorities in Malaysia than to the Malay Muslim majority (Little and Perera, 1981; Noor Laily et al., 1985). Consequently, the findings for Sri Lanka and Malaysia are compatible with the Minority Status Hypothesis. In sum, there is evidence favoring all three hypotheses associating religion with human fertility in LDC's.
India's population, the second largest in the world, is composed of so many ethnic and religious groupings as to be almost unrivalled in diversity. The caste system assigns occupational niches and thereby creates barriers to the acquisition of wealth by lowercaste Hindus. However, upward mobility would seem to be at least as

90

difficult for religious minorities, since segregation of religious communities is integral to the national make-up. While not manifest in the existence of separate political parties, this segregation can be seen in separate legal systems (e.g., Hindu law vs. Muslim law). As such, even nominal Christians or Muslims of Indian origin who have achieved wealth and upward mobility do not mix readily with their Hindu peers and face the economic liabilities of this separation (discussed more fully below). For these reasons, India provides a natural laboratory for testing the three hypotheses relating religion to fertility.
SOCIAL MEANING OF MINORITY STATUS
FOR INDIAN CHRISTIANS
Indian Christians are certainly a statistical minority, as they were only 2.43 per cent of the national population counted in the 1981 census. But a statistical minority group does not face discrimination automatically. Thus, Goldscheider's initial works required further specification of the structural contexts wherein manifest or subtle prejudice develops against a numerically small group.
To this end, Schermerhorn (1978, pp. 15-16) wrote that a proportionally small religious group cannot be a "minority group" in the sociological sense unless its members are also disadvantaged politically and economically by their membership. But Indian Christians do not suffer political disadvantage by virtue of their religious orientation. A divisive and destructive force in the national political life of India prior to Independence in 1947 was "confessional politics"--politics used to promote the manifest interests of

particular religious groups. Therefore, the Indian state was founded on the principles of secularism, pluralism, and centrism. After Independence, the Congress Party of Nehru and Gandhi did not become the confessional party of the Hindu religious majority partly because of the challenge that such an identity would have posed to maintaining a broad national following. In addition, the Hindus are subdivided along the lines of class, caste, subcaste, rural/urban residence, region, and language; and such lines of cleavage have thwarted their coalescence around common political issues seen as salient to Hinduism (Rudolph and Rudolph, 1987; Schermerhorn, 1978). Only in Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, and Kerala are there political parties with specific religious identities. Therefore, in most states and union territories of India since Independence, religiousgroup membership has been incidental to the exercise of political power.
Disadvantage in economic, rather than political, power determines the minority status of Christians in India. In general, Christianity has appealed most broadly to the poorest Indians, i.e., members of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. Converts formed endogamous enclaves that used churchsupported educational systems as ladders to higher occupational status (Mandelbaum, 1970). Through training in church-related schools, colleges, and universities, Christians achieved higher rates of literacy in English than did Hindus and thereby netted a disproportionate share of jobs in the civil service, railway, and army, as well as in communications media, school systems, and white collar occupations (Schermerhorn, 1978, p. 190). The

Christian church's emphasis on education for women (an innovation for India) was at first resisted by Indian Christians but later accepted as a form of dowry for attracting a higher-class son-in-law. Yet despite these economic incentives to conversion, Christians typically work under Hindus in the formal urban economy and seldom become entrepreneurs or arrivals in the uppermost socioeconomic classes without Hindu sponsorship (Schermerhorn, 1978, pp. 199-203). The handicap to Christians is not that Hindus actively despise them but that Hindus simply ignore their problems while saving advantages for themselves. The small size of the Christian community in most states and union territories leaves Christians with a less extensive network from which to derive internal economic sponsorship.
Christians compete against other religious groups for resources in a variety of physical, social, and economic environments across India, and these settings also serve to differentiate Christians from each other within the subcontinent. For instance, the scheduled tribes in Northeastern India (most of whom are Christians) are distinguishable from other Christians and from caste Hindus by race, language, occupation, and geography. The racial features of these tribes are Mongolian, and their linguistic dialects are TibetoBurmese. Unlike other Christians or caste Hindus, the scheduled tribes in Northeastern India largely practice slash-and-burn cultivation of rice with hoes, knives, and sickles and supplement the rice crop with foods from hunting and gathering. Communal ownership has hampered agricultural development, since land cannot be of-

fered by individual farmers as collateral for loans. In addition, most of the tribal peoples in Northeastern India live in the forested hills, where the terrain has made the irrigation of rice paddies difficult and has physically isolated the inhabitants from the nontribal peoples in the plains. The resultant lack of transportation and communication linkages with outside markets has further limited the economic development of the Northeastern states and territories. The economically disadvantaged status of the scheduled tribes was formally recognized by the Indian Constitution of 1950, which reserved seats for tribal peoples in secondary and tertiary educational institutions and in legislatures. It is apparent that the occupational advantages of educated Christians over the Hindu masses within the more developed regions of India do not characterize most Christians (who are primarily tribal peoples) in Northeastern India.
It was argued above that if differences in Hindu and Christian fertility arise solely from specific doctrines forbidding efficient contraception or placing a premium on sons, then Hindu fertility should exceed that of Christians in all ecological zones of India. On the other hand, the Characteristics Hypothesis would propose similar fertility between Hindus and Christians in all subnational contexts after such distinguishing factors as urban residence, education, and age at marriage had been held constant. Yet if a small size adversely affects a religious group's social and economic power in India, then the social and economic disadvantages should be greatest for Christians in the states/union territories where Christians are a minority and least for them

in the states/union territories where they are the numerical majority. Also, these disadvantages should weigh more similarly on Christians and Hindus in the states/union territories where both are numerical minorities. Therefore, the Minority Status Hypothesis would predict lower Christian than Hindu fertility in the first group of states/territories, lower Hindu than Christian fertility in the second group of states/territories, and similar Christian and Hindu fertility in the third group of states/territories (Figure 1). As such, aggregating states/union territories in this way and comparing religious differences in fertility across these aggregates permits a simultaneous test of the three hypotheses associating religion with human fertility.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The 1981 census was the first in India to ask currently married women for the number of children ever born alive to them. Furthermore, the census asked the wives' religious preferences, their ages (in completed years), and durations of marriage. Thus, for a

given state or union territory, I computed the mean numbers of children ever born to currently married Hindu and Christian women aged 35-44 by five-year duration-of-marriage groupings. I multiplied these means by the "standard population"--the number of all wives aged 35-44 in the nation arrayed by rural-urban residence, education, age (within the 35-44 year grouping), and duration of marriage. Summing these products yielded the total number of children expected ever to be born; and dividing this sum by the size of the standard population yielded the standardized cumulative fertility rate. This "direct method" of standardization removed any differences in the mean number of children ever born per Hindu and Christian wife in a given state/territory that were attributable to compositional differences between them in rurality, education, age, or length of marriage (see Table 1 for an illustration and Shryock and Siegel, 1976, pp. 241-43, for further discussion).
It is important to consider how differences between Hindus and Christians in net errors of census coverage

might bias the contrasts in their standardized rates of fertility. One way to judge the accuracy of a census count is to examine the sex ratio (the number of males per 100 females) of the enumerated population. In the absence of heavy population losses due to wars or emigrations or heavy gains from immigrations, national sex ratios below 90 suggest a severe undercount of males relative to females; and sex ratios above 105 imply a severe undercount of females relative to males (Shryock and Siegel, 1976, p. 107). The 1981 Census of India yielded a national sex ratio of 100.77 for Christians and 107.16 for Hindus (Office of the Registrar General, 1984). The distorted sex ratio for Hindus was at least partly real and attributable to much higher female than males rates of mortality during childhood and the child bearing years of adulthood (Basu, 1989; Bourne and Walker, 1991; Dyson and Moore, 1983; Visaria, 1967). However, net census underenumeration may have been especially problematic for Hindu females.
Adult females most likely to be missed by censuses in South Asia are those with little or no education, who are more often homeless and hard to locate by census interviewers and whose low gender status makes them easier to overlook when a male household informant is reporting to the census enumerator. But such women typically have much higher fertility. The results of the relatively greater net underenumeration of Hindu females should be to bias downward the standardized fertility rates of Hindus, to minimize the degree to which these rates appear to exceed those for Christians, and to weaken the apparent in-

verse relationship between education and Hindu fertility. While these biases would operate against support for the Particularistic Theology Hypothesis and the Minority Status Hypothesis, they should be weakest among the best-educated Hindu and Christian urbanites, to whom the Minority Status Hypothesis was thought most applicable (Goldscheider, 1971). Therefore, I limited the effects of these biases not only by testing whether Hindus and Christians had significantly different standardized fertility rates, but also by examining how these differences were patterned among the best-educated urban women.1
The 1981 census showed that the three largest religious groups in India (Hindus, 82.64 per cent of the national population; Muslims, 11.35 per cent; and Christians, 2.43 percent) had different subnational clusterings (Table 2). Hindus lacked a numerical majority in seven of the thirty states for which data on religious composition were obtained by the census.2 Owing to strong missionary activity in the Northeast during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Christians comprised a large numerical majority in Mizoram (83.81 per cent) and Nagaland (80.21 per cent), and a narrow majority in Meghalaya (52.62 per cent) (see Table 2 and Figure 2). The indigenous religion in the Northeast prior to the advent of Western Christian missionaries was an animism mixed with strong elements of
1In an analysis of variance, this was represented by a three-way interaction term associating religion, education, and urban residence with the standardized fertility rates.
2It was impossible to complete the 1981 census in the State of Assam because of civil unrest among religious groups. Therefore, Assam does not appear in this analysis.

ancestor worship, still the most common religion in Arunachal Pradesh (51.60 per cent, data not in Table 2). Muslims composed the majority of the population in Jammu and Kashmir (64.19 per cent) and Lakshadweep (94.84 per cent), while Sikhs comprised the numerical majority in Punjab (60.75 per cent, data not in Table 2). It was necessary to omit the Union Territory of Lakshadweep and the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli from the present investigation,

since these territories did not provide separate fertility tables for Christians.3 There remained 28 states and territories for further analysis: 22 with Hindu majorities, 3 with Christian majorities, and 3 with other majorities.
3The Office of the Registrar General in New Delhi published a book of fertility tables for each state or union territory except for the State of Assam. Each book contains separate fertility tables for rural and urban areas and within each type of area, subtables for each religious grouping. The general title is Census of India 1981: Part VI A & B, Fertility Tables.

enumerations, differences in the rates did not arise from sampling errors. Thus, while tests of statistical significance were not strictly applicable, F statistics from an analysis of variance (ANOVA) in fertility rates were used to condense the information contained in the 560 rates and to judge the relative importance of urban-rural residence, education and religion of the wife, and religious composition of the state/union territory.
The ANOVA in Table 3 showed that the standardized number of children ever born per wife aged 35-44 was significantly lower for urban women (F = 119.429,/? < 0.001) and for women with higher levels of education (F = 57.013,p < 0.001). However, the combination of urban residence with higher education was not associated with much lower fertility for Christians than Hindus (F = 0.021 for the residence x education x religion interaction term).4 For both religious groups, the level of the standardized fertility rates depended on whether the religious majority of the state/territory was Hindu, Christian, or other ( F = 15.064, p < 0.001, for the religion x majority group interaction term). The latter relationship is disaggregated by the ANOVA in Table 4.
Table 4 shows that the standardized fertility rates of all religious subgroups were much lower in the 22 states/union territories where Hindus were the religious majority than in the three states/union territories where Christians were the religious majority ( F = 70.96, beta = -1.36, p < 0.01)
4The ANOVA in Table 3 was recomputed by adding the percentages of Hindus and Christians in the state/territory as covariates. The findings were unchanged.

or in the three states/union territories where neither Hindus nor Christians held the majority (F = 18.80, beta = -0.66, p < 0.01). The higher rates of cumulative fertility in the latter six states/union territories (Arunachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Punjab) likely resulted from the high concentration of scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. It is noteworthy that the State of Punjab had the largest concentration of peoples in the scheduled castes (27 per cent of the state population) of all the states and union territories included in the 1981 census (Directorate of Census Operations in Nagaland, 1988, p. 99). Furthermore, the populations in the other five states/ territories had high concentrations of scheduled tribes. In fact, scheduled tribes made up the majority of the population in the three states/union territories where Christians constituted more than half the population (the percentages of scheduled tribes to total populations were 80.58 per cent in Meghalaya, 93.55 per cent in Mizoram, and 83.99 per cent in Nagaland) (Directorate of Census Operations in Nagaland, 1988, pp. 100-103).
Table 4 shows very similar Hindu and Christian fertility in states and territories where Hindus were the religious majority (beta = 0.08, p < 0.14) and where both shared the status of a religious minority (beta = --0.15, p < 0.31). These two findings were consistent with the Characteristics Hypothesis (Figure 1, Row 2, Cols. 1 and 3). However, Hindu fertility was much lower than Christian fertility (beta = -0.75, p < 0.01) in the states and territories where Christians were the religious majority group (i.e., in Me-

ghalaya, Mizoram, and Nagaland). This latter relationship appeared to contradict the Characteristics Hypothesis in favor of the Minority Status Hypothesis (Figure 1, Col. 2).
It is unlikely that religious doctrine denouncing efficient contraception led to higher Christian than Hindu fertility in Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Nagaland. Catholics were not disproportionately represented in these areas, which were the focus of intense Protestant missionary activity in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (Hollister, 1956; Webster, 1976). However, if the status of being a religious minority depressed Hindu fertility rates below Christian levels in Meghalaya, Mizo-

ram, and Nagaland, then the same phenomenon should be observed for the Muslim minority group in these areas.
To examine this possibility, data from these two states and one union territory were pooled, and the variance in the standardized cumulative fertility rates between Christians and Muslims was estimated with an ANOVA (Table 5). The variance did not differ significantly between the majority Christians and the minority Muslims (F = 1.635), a result at odds with the Minority Status Hypothesis. A plausible interpretation, congruent with the Characteristics Hypothesis, is that the great impoverishment of Christians and

Muslims in Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Nagaland rendered their fertility rates similar to each other and boosted these rates above Hindu levels.
In contrast to most Hindus within their own state/territory or Christians in other regions, almost all Christians in Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Nagaland belong to scheduled tribes, practice swidden agriculture, cannot produce a marketable surplus, live outside a monetized economy, and exist in poverty. Because subsistence farmers do not usually experience large numbers of children as an unbearable burden and perhaps even view them as a cheap and valuable source of labor for the labor-intensive tasks of slash-and-burn agriculture, their fertility rates are higher than for persons with other livelihoods. The 1981 census data did not

permit me to control the effects of wives' and husbands' occupations on rates of cumulative fertility. Yet the characteristics of Christians in Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Nagaland as impoverished farmers or the offspring of impoverished farmers can likely interpret not only the higher fertility rates of Christians than Hindus there but also the much higher fertility rates of those states/territories.
Likewise, severe poverty characterizes most Muslims in Nagaland, Meghalaya, and Mizoram. Muslims were only 1.52 per cent of the Nagalander population in 1981, but their numbers had tripled during the 1971-81 decade (Directorate of Census Operations in Nagaland, 1988). Much of this increase was due to inmigration from the State of Assam, which borders Nagaland and

which enumerated a large Muslim minority (24.03 per cent) in the 1971 census (Director of Census Operations, Assam, 1981, pp. 205-6). Indeed, a reason for outmigration of Muslims from Assam was the strife between them and the Hindu majority which prevented the completion of the 1981 census in that state. The number of decadal foreign immigrants from Bangladesh (26,242) was more than half the number of Muslims counted in Meghalaya in 1981 (41,434) and contributed greatly to the Muslims' growth rate of 57 per cent during the 1971-81 decade in the state (Directorate of Census Operations in Meghalaya, 1988). The 17 per cent growth rate of the Muslim population in Mizoram in the 1971-81 decade was more modest than that in Nagaland and Meghalaya, but the decade saw greater inmigration to Mizoram due to more peaceful conditions there. In particular, it witnessed the immigration of Chakma tribal members from Bangladesh (Directorate of Census Operations in Mi-

zoram, 1988, p. 92). Consequently, the deep impoverishment of Muslims relative to Hindus in Nagaland, Meghalaya, and Mizoram has roots in the civil unrest of Assam and the even poorer economy of Bangladesh.
DISCUSSION
Three distinct approaches have interpreted religious differences in human fertility. The Particularistic Theology Hypothesis stresses the pronatalist influence of special theological doctrines forbidding usage of efficient contraception or emphasizing the importance of sons. The Characteristics Hypothesis argues that the antinatalist effects of such characteristics as urban residence, higher education, or late age at marriage ought to operate similarly for all religious groups such that differences in group composition on these variables should account completely for differences in their fertility. However, the Minority Status Hypothesis contends that the antinatalist

102

Johnson

effects of urban residence or higher education might be stronger for a minority than a majority, since better educated urbanites have greater prospects for upward mobility but since minorities with such characteristics may face prejudice or other impediments that hamper their pursuit of it. In such a context, the members of a religious minority group are thought to compensate with lower fertility than the majority group, if antinatalism is seen as a way to move up. Until now, almost all tests of these hypotheses have used data from countries in North America, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.
Departing from that tradition, this study used data from the 1981 census of India to calculate mean numbers of children ever born per Hindu and Christian wife aged 35-44 years. The cumulative fertility rates were standardized by the "direct method" so as to remove any differences in fertility between Hindu and Christian wives attributable to differences in their composition by urban residence, education, age (within the 35-44 year grouping), or length of marriage. The standardized fertility rates were compared for Hindus and Christians in 28 states/union territories aggregated into three groups: 22 with a Hindu majority group; 3 (Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Nagaland) with a Christian majority group; and 3 (Arunachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, and Punjab) with neither as the majority group.
Contrary to the Particularistic Theology Hypothesis but consistent with the Characteristics Hypothesis, the standardized fertility rates of Hindus and Christians were highly similar in 25 of the states/union territories. It was only in Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Na-

galand where the Hindu religious minority group had consistently lower standardized fertility rates than the Christian majority group. While this result appeared to support the Minority Status Hypothesis, further analysis showed that the Muslim minority group in Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Nagaland had standardized fertility rates comparableto those of the Christian majority, a relationship contradictory to the Minority Status Hypothesis. It was argued above that Christians and Muslims in these three states/territories were more likely than Hindus there or their coreligionists elsewhere in India to have economic characteristics that placed them below the poverty line. Thus, the fertility patterns described in the tables above are the most consistent with the Characteristics Hypothesis.
The findings of this study have implications for the national family planning program. For example, even after currently married women's present ages and durations of marriage had been statistically controlled, Christians had lower cumulative fertility in states/ union territories where Hindus predominate numerically as compared to Christians in areas lacking a Hindu majority. This result may have reflected a greater prevalence of contraception among Christians in areas where Hindus predominate than among Christians elsewhere in India, since the statistical controls addressed the biological effects of aging and nuptiality on the exposure to the risk of childbirth. This prevalence probably did not represent antinatalist pressures unique to religious minorities seeking upward socioeconomic mobility. Rather, it most likely reflected the higher levels

of educational attainment and urbanization for Christians outside the six states/territories lacking a Hindu majority. Indeed, women with higher education or urban residences had lower cumulative fertility, regardless of their state/territory or religion.
The results of this study pose several questions for further investigation. From these 1981 census data, it was impossible to compute separate fertility rates for Christians of mixed, IndianEuropean ancestry. The largest subgroup of these are the descendants of British fathers employed in the military or the colonial administration and Indian mothers of the lower castes. Because the Anglo-Indian children of these mixed couples were rejected by both groups, Anglo-Indians came to marry endogamously, to establish separate school systems using English as the medium of instruction, and to frequent segregated social clubs. AngloIndians favor European dress and dietary customs. They are commonly employed in government jobs associated with transportation and communication, but social ostracism usually prevents their reaching the highest levels of authority (Kluck, 1985). Since their racial distinctiveness, language, clothing, and diet visibly set them apart from other Christians, the AngloIndian Christians may be the subgroup within the Christian community most likely to experience the economic disadvantages that social and cultural separation from the larger Christian and Hindu communities creates. Future research should explore whether AngloIndian Christians have lower fertility and higher contraceptive prevalence than do other Christians or Hindus and whether they report such antinatalism

as a conscious strategy to counter prejudice against them which hinders their upward mobility.
Macro-level studies based on census data for states, territories, or nations can show aggregate patterns of fertility which may or may not be consistent with one of the three hypotheses tested here. Such studies are of interest because research about the unique effects of religious group membership and minority status on fertility in LDC's is sparse and because census data provide convenient documentary evidence for conducting such research. However, the Particularistic Theology Hypothesis is grounded in the assumption that couples know about a particular pronatalist religious doctrine, believe in it, and consciously seek to uphold it. Similarly, the Minority Status Hypothesis is predicated on the assumption that couples perceive bias against them because of their membership in a numerically small group and deliberately use low fertility as strategy to overcome the limits this discrimination places on their chances for upward mobility. In short, tests of these hypotheses with census data from LDC's should be supplemented by micro-level analyses suited to explore the social-psychological linkages assumed to connect religion, minority status, and reproductive behavior.
Finally, future work should use more recent data to seek whether an antinatalist minority-status effect has emerged for Christians and other religious minorities in India, as it may have for several religious minority groups in Sri Lanka and Malaysia (Little and Perera, 1981;Noor Laily et al., 1985). When the 1981 census of India was conducted, about 23 per cent of
