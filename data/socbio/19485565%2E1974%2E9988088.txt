A recent publication by the World Health Organization deplores the trend away from breastfeeding of infants by mothers throughout the world, especially in developing countries (quoted in The New York Times, April 8, 1973, p. 23). It was suggested that the Western "fashion" of not breastfeeding was being diffused to the rest of the world to the detriment of the nutritional status of infants of poorer families. In this article, we will examine the trend and sodoeconomic determinants of breastfeeding behavior in the United States.
In spite of the widespread interest and concern about this phenomenon, the present state of knowledge regarding the incidence and correlates of breastfeeding is quite limited. Most previous research on the topic has been flawed either because the nature of the sample did not allow for generalization or because of inadequate analysis. Our present research is able to exploit a rather unique data source, the 1965 National Fertility Survey, which allows us to examine, within the limitations of cross-sectional survey data, national trends and patterns of breastfeeding among American mothers.
PAST RESEARCH
There are at least two research traditions in which empirical data on the rate

and patterns of breastfeeding in the United States have been analyzed. One has been sociological, the study of the relationship between social class and childrearing practices (Davis and Havighurst, 1946; Havighurst and Davis, 1955; Sears et al., 1957; Boeketal., 1958; Bronfenbrenner, 1958). Such studies have usually been based on local community surveys where social class (usually some sort of Warner Index) was related to childrearing patterns, one of which was the feeding of infants by nursing or by bottle. The other has been medical or public-health-oriented (Bain, 1948; Meyer, 1958; Salber et al., 1958; Robertson, 1961; Salber and Feinleib, 1966; Newton and Newton, 1967). These studies are often based on data collected from hospitals or clinic populations with a focus on the kinds of factors that facilitate or encourage the practice of breastfeeding.
AH of these studies have been crosssectional in that they focus on the behavior of mothers who have infant children at the time of the survey or ask about the mother's last birth. At best, such studies can only estimate the extent of breastfeeding with a crude rate (the number of mothers currently breastfeeding divided by the number of eligible mothers). Since birth order (parity) has been shown to be correlated with breastfeeding behavior, the

estimate of a crude rate will be partially a function of the composition of births by parity for that particular time and place. In addition, and perhaps more serious a fault in such studies, is the confusion of incidence and duration of breastfeeding. Different studies have combined these two aspects in a single index, such as the proportion of mothers who breastfed their infant for a month or more. This convention has made it difficult if not impossible to examine trends over time from the series of studies over the past few decades.
Both Bain (1948) and Mayer (1958) report the rate of breastfeeding of babies at the time of discharge from hospitals. The comparable figures for the percentage of discharged babies who were either breastfed only or breast and bottle fed were 65 per cent in 1946 (Bain, 1948, p. 315) and 37 per cent in 1956 (Meyer, 1958, p. 117). However, the average age at discharge of newborns was different for the two samples. Meyer (1958, p. 119) reports that 84 per cent of the babies in his sample left the hospital at five days of age or less while only 58 per cent of Bain's sample were discharged under eight days of age. In a national mail-back survey, taken in 1958, Robertson (1961, p. 1036) reported that 30 per cent of mothers of young infants reported that their babies were either completely or partially breastfed at one week of age.
As Robertson noted (p. 1038), these series of statistics cannot be interpreted as a trend because of the confusion of incidence of breastfeeding and duration of breastfeeding in the measures. To avoid this problem, our present research defines the dependent variable as whether the infant was "ever breastfed" regardless of the duration or whether bottlefeeding was also used. However, our data source does contain information on duration of breast-

feeding, and this should be the focus of future research.
Another basic issue is whether the unit of observation is the mother or the infant. To say that 50 per cent of all mothers breastfed their babies is not the same as saying that 50 per cent of all babies are breastfed. Most previous studies have not had to consider this issue since their data were entirely cross-sectional with the focus on the mother and her newly born infant. Our data contain a retrospective account by each woman on her reproductive career and whether or not she breastfed each baby she had. The main focus of our paper is on the mother as the unit of observation because she is the primary actor, and we are interested in the relationship of her social characteristics and the likelihood of breastfeeding. But how do we compare a woman who breastfed two out of her four children with a woman who breastfed her only baby? Is the first mother who has breastfed twice as many children as the second mother to be counted as only half as likely to breastfeed since she only nurses 50 per cent of her children while the second woman breastfed 100 per cent of hers? In our present research, we have resolved this dilemma by focusing on a single parity, the likelihood to breastfeed the first birth of the mother. This allows us to compare both women with completed and uncompleted fertility in the same analysis. Future research should be directed to variations in breastfeeding by parity.
Another problem plaguing most previous studies in this area has been inadequate samples. This has limited the ability to generalize the results of such studies to all American mothers or to really investigate differentials of breastfeeding among subpopulations. Most studies have been local samples drawn from the community or city near the university or hospital where the

investigator was located. Of the three nationwide studies previously cited, two (Bain, 1948, and Meyer, 1958) were based on surveys of hospitals, both of which had nonresponse rates of over 25 per cent. The third nationwide survey (Robertson, 1961) was based on a mail-back questionnaire of recent mothers which had a final sample size of 1,275 and a response rate of 82 per cent. While this was the best of previous data sources, the entire analysis consisted of three bivariate tables.
Another general weakness of most earlier studies has been a lack of multivariate analyses regarding the social determinants of breastfeeding behavior. This is particularly true for the study of the relationship of social-background characteristics of the mother and the likelihood she will breastfeed her baby. Some studies report that higher socioeconomic status women are most likely to breastfeed their infants, while other studies report the opposite (see Bronfenbrenner, 1958, for summary of this research). Whether the differences between studies can be attributed to temporal trends or regional variations is difficult to discern because sometimes the socioeconomic characteristics measured pertain to the husband, sometimes to the mother herself, sometimes just to a composite social class measure for the family as a unit.
DATA
Our research is based upon a secondary analysis of data from the 1965 National Fertility Survey. These data were originally collected for a study of fertility in the United States and the main results and analyses were published in Ryder and Westoff (1971). The 1965 National Fertility Survey was the third in a series of national cross-sectional surveys conducted by demographers to study fertility and

family planning attitudes and behavior of American married couples. The earlier two surveys were the 1955 Growth of American Families (Freedman, Whelpton, and Campbell, 1959) and the 1960 Growth of American Families (Whelpton, Campbell, and Patterson, 1966). A fourth study in this series, the 1970 National Fertility Survey was recently conducted. Professor Larry Bumpass of the University of Wisconsin has collected the original data files from the 1955, 1960, and 1965 surveys, produced standard code books and data tapes, and made them available to any interested researcher for a nominal cost.
The 1965 National Fertility Survey contains a wealth of socioeconomic and fertility-related data for a total of 5,617 married women, with husbands present, born after July 1, 1910. The interviews were conducted in late 1965 and early 1966. Although the survey had a probability sampling frame, the sample is not a self-weighting one because older women, age 45 to 54, were only half-sampled and Black women were double-sampled. In order to have a representative national sample, an appropriate weighting procedure was used. The weights adjust the sample to conform to the relative distribution by age and race of the national population of married women with husbands present as estimated from the census bureau's Current Poulation Survey (for further notes on the survey methodology, including the complete questionnaire, see Ryder and Westoff, 1971).
As part of the questionnaire, each woman was asked for retrospective information on her entire reproductive career. For each live birth, the woman was asked whether or not she breastfed her baby, and if so, for how many months. Our analysis is limited to only the first question, whether the mother nursed her infant. Data on

lactation were not collected in either the 1955 or 1960 Growth of American Families surveys, but the questions on the subject were added to the 1965 survey to investigate the effect of lactation upon the duration of postpartum amenorrhea.
Because the 1965 National Fertility Survey is a cross-sectional survey of currently married women, there are some limitations of the sample which might bias our findings. Women who were formerly married or were not living with their husbands in 1965 were not interviewed. Thus, our estimates of breastfeeding behavior in years prior to 1965 are biased to the extent that these women who were omitted from the survey had different reproductive and lactation behavior than women who were still married in 1965 and included in the sample. Also, women who are not yet married are not included in the sample. Thus, the youngest cohorts of women in the sample, ages 15 to 19 and 20 to 24, are overrepresentative of women who married at younger ages. We do not believe these biases are serious enough to obscure the basic findings of the study.
As mentioned earlier, the total sample size of women in the survey was 5,617. For this analysis, we excluded 662 of these women because they never had any live births, plus 37 women whose first births were twins or triplets for whom breastfeeding information was not coded. Thus, our sample consists of 4,918 mothers with single first births. In the subsequent analysis, we will always report the unweighted sample frequencies along with the weighted percentage tables. Some tables will contain a few cases less than 4,918, because an observation was excluded if data were missing on a variable in the table.
OBJECTIVES
We know of no adequate theoretical perspective that can guide empirical research in this area. At most, the ideas from

popular culture suggest that breastfeeding has declined as society moved from a traditional, rural-based, family-centered structure to the modern urban social milieu where traditional culture regarding childbirth and child care were discarded. Similarly, we might expect that resurgence of popular interest in natural foods, natural childbirth, bicycling to work, etc., represent attempts to recapture less modern or mechanized ways of dealing with the basic tasks of life. Thus, there might be some basis to believe that breastfeeding may have been making a comeback in recent years. Although we will not be able to test these speculations directly, our data will allow us to examine trends in breastfeeding behavior until 1965.
Other more limited hypotheses regarding the propensity of mothers of differing social backgrounds to breastfeed their infants can be tested with the available data. One sort of general hypothesis might be that certain traditional subcultures based in religion, ethnicity or nationality, farm residence or region of residence may have a common "heritage" of breastfeeding. We will call this the cultural hypothesis and test it with several empirical indicators. Another hypothesis might be that socioeconomic characteristics such as the mother's education and occupational role may affect breastfeeding behavior. We will also test several variations of this socioeconomic hypothesis.
In the final section of the paper, we will attempt to synthesize our various findings and develop a model of "social background and breastfeeding" in a regression analysis framework. Thus, the descriptive analysis will be used in a preliminary effort to develop a theory of breastfeeding based upon available empirical evidence.
We should note that our study contains no information on a number of important factors in determining whether a mother nurses her child. Here we might include

the personality of the mother, the advice of her doctor or other medical personnel, discussion with other mothers, the husband's attitude, etc. For a survey of the literature on some of these issues, see Newton and Newton (1967).
TRENDS IN BREASTFEEDING Since the 1965 National Fertility Survey contains retrospective data, we can reconstruct trends in breastfeeding behavior over time. For instance, a woman 50 years old in 1965 would report on her reproductive career which might have begun in the early 1930's and lasted until the middle 195O's. There seem to be at least two ways to organize the data to analyze trends over time.1 One way is to examine trends by the year of the birth of the child. In demographic terms, this would be called period analysis, to see what effects, if any, are exerted by the year in which the event took place. There are good sociological reasons for believing that the period will have an influence. During the past thirty years, American society has become a more urban and metropolitan society, and this is thought to have exerted a strong influence on the family structure, the locale of childbirth, the proportion of women in the labor force, and other factors that might influence the decision to breastfeed an infant. The effects of depression, economic prosperity, and wartime are exerted upon families in a period fashion.
Another way to measure trends over time is to organize the same data by birth cohorts of mothers. If social change is occurring in a society, it seems likely that the changes are being made by new generations (cohorts) who think and behave in a different fashion than their elders. The causes of changes in a cultural pattern

like breastfeeding over successive cohorts might be attributed to changes in socialization or important changes in society being experienced by a cohort at an impressionable stage in their life cycle. Ryder (1965) has made the most convincing argument that social change should be measured on an intercohort basis.
In Table 1, we attempt to look at the trend in breastfeeding by both the year of birth of the infant and the birth cohort of the mother. Before beginning to interpret the patterns in Table 1, let us consider what information is there. First, of all, it only contains information on the proportion of mothers who breastfed their first infant. Because of the limitations of the sample, formerly married women or women not living with their husbands in 1965 are not represented. Also, the youngest cohorts only represent those women who were married and had a first child at a young age. Along the left margin are the birth cohorts of mothers arranged in five-year groups from 1911-15 to 1946-50. In a column beside the birth cohort years are the approximate ages of the mothers at the time of the interview in 1965. The figures of the youngest two cohorts of mothers, ages 15-19 and ages 20-24 in 1965, may not really represent the eventual behavior of all mothers in these cohorts. Along the top margin of Table 1 is the year of birth of first babies, grouped in five-year intervals from 1926-30 to 1961-- 65. Since the sample only contains women born after July 1, 1910,2 the earliest periods, 1926-30 and 1931-35, only contain information on young mothers in those years. The age range of the sample
2In coding the birth cohorts of mothers in the sample, we have followed the demographic convention of fiscal years. For instance, the birth cohort of 1911 includes all women born between July 1, 1910, and June 30, 1911, thus making the midpoint of the cohort, January 1, 1911. The five-year birth cohort, 1911 to 1915, includes women born between July 1, 1910, and June 30, 1915.

of mothers is shown in parentheses under the year of each period. To the extent that there were sharp differentials in breastfeeding by age of mother in the early periods, our estimates are not representative of the rates of all first-parity women in those years.
Within these limitations, what trends can be observed from Table 1? First of all, both marginals show a consistent downward trend in the percentage of mothers breastfeeding their first baby. Looking at the marginal distribution by period, it seems that about three out of four first babies were breastfed before 1940; breastfeeding declined steadily through to the most recent period, 1961-65, when less than one in three babies were being breastfed. The downward trend by birth cohorts of mothers is also quite dramatic. About two out of three mothers who were born before 1920 nursed their first child, but only slightly more than one out of three nursed their first child in the birth cohorts of 1936-40 and 1941-1945. The cells of this table show the variation in breastfeeding rates for mothers jointly categorized by cohort and the year of their first birth. As one reads cells from left to right for any row, the pattern of percentages shows the differences between mothers who had their first child at a younger to older age within the same birth cohort. In general, for every cohort, a younger age at first birth meant a higher likelihood of breastfeeding. One might attribute this to period effects that operate within each cohort. Another explanation could be that women who marry and become mothers at young age are more likely to follow traditional child care practices (including breastfeeding). Perhaps both explanations might be true.
There is no consistent trend for breastfeeding rates by cohort within a period (reading down columns). Generally, later

cohorts (women having their first birth at an earlier age) have higher breastfeeding rates than earlier cohorts for the same period. This does not mean that for any period a higher proportion of younger rather than older women are breastfeeding their infants. Since we are only considering first births, the range of ages for any period only represents their distribution by age at first birth.
The general conclusion that emerges from Table 1 is that breastfeeding has been on the decline no matter from what perspective we view it. Although our data only allow for an analysis of the trend for several decades prior to 1965, we suspect that breastfeeding was almost a universal pattern around the turn of the century, but has been declining since then. If there has been a resurgence of breastfeeding in recent years, it was not apparent in 1965. Future analysis of trends from the 1970 National Fertility Survey data will allow for investigation of the 1965-70 period.
CULTURAL BACKGROUND
Let us now turn to the question of the association between characteristics of the mother and her propensity to breastfeed her baby. Our initial hypothesis is that mothers from more traditional subcultures of the American population will be more likely to breastfeed their infants. We will first consider religion and nationality or ethnicity as indicators of subcultural groups. We expect that Catholics are more traditional than Protestants, and that ethnic groups that have more recently immigrated to the United States from Eastern and Southern Europe are more traditional than those with a Northwestern European ethnic heritage. We also will consider Black and Latin American mothers to be more traditional. Supposedly this might result from a more closely knit

cent is extremely low. Examination of the cells of the table shows several interesting patterns. Being a Catholic makes a mother less likely to breastfeed her first baby for most all nationality groups with the exception of Latin American mothers. There is a difference of 19 or 20 points in the proportion breastfeeding between Catholics and Protestants among Black, Irish, and French mothers.
Our initial expectation of traditional culture increasing the likelihood of breastfeeding was only supported by the higherthan-average rates of Black Protestants and Latin American Catholic mothers. With these exceptions, mothers from a white, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant cultural background were more likely to breastfeed their first baby than were Catholic or Jewish mothers. Since our initial conjecture and reasoning were not supported by the data, we are a bit reluctant to offer any post-hoc interpretations for these findings. However, one confounding cultural influence might be regional and rural-urban differences.
Our next analysis, still under the rubric of cultural background, will focus on the factors just mentioned: differentials by current residence which have been associated with unique social traditions. Current residence is divided into the four major regions of the United States: Northeast, Midwest, South, and West. Similarly, current residence is categorized into those who live on farms and those who do not. Since many rural people are not really part of an agricultural lifestyle, we chose to utilize a farm-nonfarm distinction rather than a rural-urban one.
Table 3 shows the results of this analysis. As might be expected, farm mothers were much more likely to have breastfed their first baby than nonfarm mothers, 64 per cent compared to 49 per cent. It is easy to speculate about possible explanations here.

It may be easier for farm wives to combine the roles of a worker and mother than women whose only opportunity for work is in the wage economy.
The marginal distribution of breastfeeding proportions by region shows the South and West to be six and eight points respectively above the grand mean while the Midwest and Northeast are below it. The Northeast is substantially lower than the rest of the country with only 40 per cent of mothers breastfeeding their first infants. The cells in Table 3 show that breastfeeding rates are high for farm residence in all regions of the country, especially in the South with a proportion of 69 per cent. There is considerable variation in the rate of breastfeeding among nonfarm residents by region with a range from 39 per cent in the Northeast to 55 per cent in the West. The explanation for regional variation in breastfeeding patterns, particularly for nonfarm residents, is not obvious. To say that there are regional cultures is really just a paraphrase of the original statement that there exist differentials.

One explanation might be religious composition of the various regions. We know that the Northeast population contains significant numbers of Catholic and Jewish people. To examine this association, Table 4 shows the proportion of mothers who breastfed their first babies cross-classified by region and religion. This table suggests that Catholics are less likely to breastfeed their infants than Protestant mothers in all regions except the West. For some reason, Catholics in the West are 14 points (58 and 44) more likely to nurse their first babies than Catholics for the -whole country.
The very low rate of breastfeeding in the Northeast is substantially due to the low breastfeeding rate of Catholic and Jewish mothers, but Protestant mothers there are also less likely to breastfeed their infants. For whatever reason, the effects of region are significant and are not simply a reflection of the religious and farm composition of the various areas.
In sum, one might conclude that cultural factors, as we have identified region, religion, nationality, and farm residence,

have a substantial association with the proportion of mothers who decide to breastfeed their first infant. The explanation for these cultural differences may reflect differential patterns of kinship structure, the distribution of medical advice, certain social-psychological factors, or some other factor. More intensive investigations might provide some basis for choice among these alternative explanations.
SOCIOECONOMIC BACKGROUND
We will now turn to our second hypothesis, the relationship between socioeconomic characteristics of the mother and her propensity to breastfeed her infant. As before, we shall limit our investigation to the first birth of all mothers whose first birth was not part of a multiple birth. Our major indices of socioeconomic status will be the educational attainment and the occupation (if she has been employed since marriage, otherwise coded "never worked") of the mother. Before providing a rationale for the choice of these particular measures, let us consider why we think that position

in the socioeconomic hierarchy affects the likelihood of a mother deciding to nurse her baby.
Perhaps the most basic fact underlying this relationship is that to bottle feed an infant costs money whereas breastfeeding does not, except that the mother might eat more. So, we might expect that mothers from poorer economic circumstances would be more likely to breastfeed than higher status women. However, it might be argued that the additional costs of bottle feeding are relatively minor and that only the poorest families would be constrained. Another difference that might be attributable to socioeconomic status is the nature of information and advice that might be given by medical personnel and friends to expectant mothers about the pro's and con's of breastfeeding. For instance, does the advice of the private doctor in the suburbs differ from the advice of the public health nurse in a rural area? We don't know of any systematic evidence on this issue, but we imagine that differences do exist.
Another issue that might be associated with socioeconomic status is the competition of other activities of the mother with child care. If a woman engages in wage labor outside of the home, it is very difficult to maintain a schedule of breastfeeding for her baby. Day-care centers at the woman's place of work with periodic breaks during the day to visit her infant are common in many socialist countries, but not in the United States. So we might expect that mothers who decide to work soon after childbirth because of economic or other reasons might be much less likely to nurse their infants.
Our choice of education and occupation of the mothers as indices of socioeconomic status really do not allow us to directly test some of the specific hypotheses just mentioned, but they might provide some indication of the basic relationship. We

would ideally like to have some precise information regarding the economic circumstances and employment situation of the woman both before and after the birth of her infant. However, the measures of income in the survey focus upon the year of the survey, 196S,which may be decades after the birth of the infant. Our choice of educational attainment as a key indicator rests, in part, on the fact that it is fixed relatively early in life and usually has a rather high association with other dimensions of a person's socioeconomic status. Occupation, though it might change over time, is also a good measure that reflects a person's access to income, authority, and autonomy which might affect her child-care opportunities.
Table 5 shows the proportion of mothers who breastfeed their first baby by the education and race of the mother. Race is divided into three categories: White,

Black, and Other (includes Japanese, Chinese, Native American). Educational attainment is divided into six categories: (1) 6 years or less, (2) 7-9 years, (3) 1011 years, (4) 12 years, (5) 13-15 years, (6) 16 or more.
By race, "Others" (non-Black minorities) have the highest proportion breastfeeding, 64 per cent, while Blacks are next with 58 per cent and whites with 50 per cent. The pattern by education shows an interesting curvilinear relationship with the lowest educational category being the highest with 74 per cent which declines regularly to high-school graduates who have a low of 44 per cent and then rises for those with a college education. Those women with 16 or more years of education have a higher proportion of mothers who breastfed their first baby than any category except those mothers with six years or less of education. The cells of this table show that the overall pattern by education is true for both white

and Black mothers. The interpretation of this table opens up a series of new hypotheses, which we will not be able to investigate in this paper.
However, let us look at the crossclassification of education of the mother by her occupation (if she had ever worked) in Table 6. Occupation is divided into the following categories: (1) never worked, always been a housewife since marriage; (2) white collar, includes professionals, managers, and sales workers; (3) clerical; (4) blue collar, includes craftsmen (sic), operatives, and laborers; (5) service workers; and (6) farm.
Looking at the marginal distribution by occupation, it is interesting to note that housewives (never worked since marriage) do not have a higher proportion of women who breastfed their first baby than mothers who have worked at one time or another since their marriage as a white collar, service, or farm worker. Clerical and blue collar occupations seem to have a negative

association with the likelihood of breastfeeding. Inspection of cells of the table indicates that the curvilinear relationship of education with breastfeeding seems to hold within each occupation category. Similarly, the overall pattern of a higher breastfeeding proportion by white collar and service workers than clerical and blue collar workers seems to hold within most educational attainment categories.
Thus, we are left with two relatively independent findings to explain. What is it about the lowest and highest educational attainment as well as white collar and service employment that are conducive to encouraging or making possible the opportunity for a mother to breastfeed her baby? Or, alternatively, are the mothers who are in these particular educational or occupational categories somehow selective on other characteristics which increases their propensity to nurse their babies? Let us offer our speculation for what it is worth and hope that it might suggest possible directions for future research. Perhaps the lowest educational category does suggest a rather poor economic situation where breastfeeding is a practical solution to the lack of financial resources. Perhaps, a college education might stimulate the mother's awareness of good nutrition for infants and the value of breastfeeding. Or a college education might suggest access to more progressive medical personnel who favor breastfeeding.
For the occupational differential, it is difficult to suggest possible explanations. Perhaps, white collar (teachers, nurses) and service jobs are more flexible in that they provide exit and reentry into the labor force at the woman's choice while blue collar and clerical jobs do not. A flexible job would allow a woman a good opportunity to return to her career even if she decided not to work for a year or two after her child's birth. All these poten-

tial explanations are only speculations on our part which deserve further investigations.
Our final table in this section will consider a trend analysis of the socioeconomic differential. Table 7 shows the percentage of mothers who breastfed their first baby by birth cohort and educational attainment of the mother.
The declining trend in the percentage of mothers who nursed their first infant is generally evident for most educational categories, although it is much less clear for the lowest and the highest educational categories than for those in the middle. In fact, for the educational category of 16 years or more of education, there is no consistent trend. Of course, the social significance of these educational categories is not the same over time. The proportion of women attending and graduating from college has increased in each successive cohort.
Among the oldest cohort of mothers (1911-15), there is almost no educational differential in breastfeeding. There is perhaps some slight negative association (better educated women are less likely to breastfeed), but it is very minor. However, the curvilinear relationship between educational attainment and the proportion breastfeeding begins to emerge in the next cohort (1916-20) and seems to become more marked in successive cohorts. The major dynamic in the emergence of this differential is the more rapid decline in breastfeeding among women with 10-11 and 12 years of education than the decline in breastfeeding among mothers with lower and higher educational attainments. The hypothesis which suggests that bottle feeding was a custom which began among the upper middle class and was diffused to the lower middle and working classes is not supported by these data. Of course, educa-

A SOCIAL STRUCTURAL MODEL OF
SOCIAL BACKGROUND AND
BREASTFEEDING
So far in this paper we have considered the relationship between a variety of socialbackground characteristics of mothers and their propensity to breastfeed their first baby. Our effort has primarily been descriptive, and we have limited the number of independent variables to two in any one table. Undoubtedly, the confounding relationships among the entire range of cultural and socioeconomic independent variables have been minimized in this analysis. Additionally, there are other interesting relationships with other variables in the data set that are not possible to consider in this one paper. One way to begin the process of multiple variable analysis is to

construct a model of the important social determinants of the dependent variable and to order the model in a causal or sequential system. We have attempted to construct a preliminary model of the social determinants of breastfeeding which is presented in Figure 1.
Before discussing the variables in this model, we want to note the manner in which we constructed it. First of all, we are following a life-cycle perspective in constructing a causal system. At birth, individuals enter into a family of orientation (social origins) which provides an initial social matrix of personal relationships, opportunities, and belief systems that shape future behavior. The next stage is identified as educational attainment which is an index of the key socialization process which carries individuals to adulthood. The final stage in our model affecting the likelihood of a mother nursing her in-

fant is her adult social status which may transmit influences from earlier in life or have important independent effects.
Our approach is social-structural as we have only included variables which index one's membership in certain cultural or sodoeconomic subsystems of society. It is likely that the inclusion of social-psychological variables would enrich the explanatory power of this model.
Most of the variables in this model will be familiar to the reader from the tabular analysis presented earlier. However, we have included three new variables, all of which are measures of the respondent's family of origin: (a) the region the respondent grew up in; (b) farm origins of respondent; and (c) education of respondent's mother.
The utility of this model is in serving as a guide to the systematic investigation of the multiple influences of social background upon breastfeeding and also to disentangle the interrelationships among the independent variables.
Our analysis of this model was by multiple classification analysis or by dummy variable regression. We ran four separate, but cumulative, models of the effects of social background upon the rate of breastfeeding. The first model only included the five variables of social origins; the second model included all these plus the educational attainment of the respondent. The third model included all the social back-

ground variables, including those of adult social status. The fourth model included a set of birth cohort dummy variables along with those of social background as independent variables. The results of all four models are presented in Table 8. Each coefficient in any column can be interpreted as the effect of being in that particular category net of all other variables in the model. The coefficients are expressed as deviations from the grand mean of the dependent variable--in this case, the overall proportion of mothers who breastfed their first baby, 50.5 per cent. In this analysis, we have included an additional significant digit, the first number to the right of the decimal point in the percentage of mothers breastfeeding their first baby.
Perhaps one general conclusion can be drawn from the row of variance-explained (R2) figures for each of the four models. The first model with the five social origin variables explains 3.9 per cent of the variance. This increases by a statistically significant amount for each of the subsequent models, and the final cumulative model has an R2 of 11.4 (multiple R = 0.338). While these are fairly respectable figures of variance explained by social science standards, it is clear that there are many other determinants of breastfeeding behavior that are not in this model. While improved measurement or more refined categories of the existing set of variables might increase the amount of variance explained (as might the inclusion of interaction variables), it is

I Model 4 includes all these Social Background variables plus Birth Cohort as independent variables. ** All "No answer by respondent" entries were included as a separate category for each variable and included in the regression analysis. However, they are not reported here.

more likely that other variables are needed to significantly raise the figure.
However, the variables included do indicate significant influences on breastfeeding behavior. The region that the respondent grew up in seems to have a rather strong influence for two categories: "Deep South" and "Not in the U.S." Being born in the Deep South adds 5.8 per cent to the grand mean in the first model; but subsequent models indicate that this effect is largely transmitted by educational attainment and adult residence and social status.
The effect of farm origins (growing up on a farm) has a stronger and more direct impact. Net of other social origin variables, women who grew up on a farm are 6.7 per cent more likely than the average to breastfeed their first infant, and the net effect of farm origins is still 3.9 per cent after all other variables including birth cohort are included. Alternatively, this influence could be expressed as the contrast between those who grew up on a farm and those who had nonfarm origins. From this perspective, the net difference between farm-origin women and nonfarm women controlling for all other variables (fourth model) is 5.8 percentage points.

The effects of ethnicity are relatively small but very interesting. While it was noted earlier that Black mothers were about 8 percentage points more likely to breastfeed their first baby than all mothers, the first model controls for other social origin characteristics and shows that the effect of being Black upon the likelihood of breastfeeding is actually due to the other influences of social origins such as growing up in the Deep South and on a farm. After controlling for all other social background variables (Model 3), the net effect of being Black is negligible. I t rises to 3.1 percentage points after controlling for birth cohort. The explanation here is probably due to the younger age structure of Black mothers. Black mothers have had a decreasing trend of breastfeeding over time as have whites, but a cohort-specific (within each birth cohort) color differential remains.
A similar pattern for mothers of Latin American heritage emerges. Much of the positive impact of being Latin American on breastfeeding is due to other social background variables. However, the effect is stronger after controlling for cohort in Model 4.

The effects of a German and especially a Slavic heritage are positive and remain after social controls on social background, though they decline after controlling for birth cohort. The interpretation here is the opposite of that for Black and Latin American mothers; that is, part of the positive impact of being German or Slavic is simply due to an older age structure which includes more women who had children at an earlier point in time when the custom of breastfeeding was more widespread. The negative association of being Irish, Italian, and French and breastfeeding is fairly strong and further research is necessary to explain this finding.
The effects of religious preference show that being a Protestant has a positive impact on breastfeeding, while being Catholic or Jewish has a negative effect. This pattern of effects is fairly constant for all models. The negative effect of being Jewish is over 25 points below the overall average in the fourth model.
The effect of origin social status, indexed by the educational attainment of the respondent's mother, shows only minor effects, except for a positive association with the highest category of 13 years or more. Almost half of the effect of this category in Model 1 disappears in Model 2. Thus, it is transmitted indirectly via the educational attainment of the daughter.
The effects of educational attainment (Model 2) are among the strongest in the whole table with the curvilinear relationship described earlier. These are moderated somewhat by the inclusion of adult social characteristics in Model 3. Inclusion of cohort membership (Model 4) attenuates them further, although the overall pattern remains the same. It seems that much of the effect of the lowest educational attainment category is really a result of the high proportion of older women in this category.

The net impact of farm residence is to make farm mothers S per cent more likely to breastfeed than nonfarm mothers. Region of residence as an adult shows the negative effect of being in the Northeast and the positive effect of the West on the proportion of mothers breastfeeding their first baby.
The effect of a mother's occupation discussed earlier in the tabular analysis is similar in this regression analysis which controls for all other social background variables. Women who have been employed as white collar or service workers are more likely to breastfeed their first baby than are women who have been employed as clerical or blue collar workers. Those women who have no occupation (never worked since marriage) are 3 per cent above the average proportion breastfeeding. The effect of farm employment is not really clear. Only 31 of the 473 women who lived on farms reported that they worked as farmers or farm employees. So it is difficult to be sure what this category actually represents.
The effects of the birth cohort variables, net of all variables, show the strong trend away from breastfeeding in the United States. These are the largest coefficients in the whole table, and this one variable alone adds an additional 4 points to the proportion of variance explained. This downward trend over time cannot be explained away by the changing composition of mothers, at least for the variables included in this analysis.
DISCUSSION
