ABSTRACT: After merging data on counties from the 1970 census and data from 1969 family planning programs, we aggregated smaller counties as necessary into statistical areal units (SAU's) of at least 20,000 white or 10,000 Black women aged 15-44. We used multiple regression analysis of 12 white and 12 Black subgroups of wives (divided by age and 1969 family income) to test an explanatory model, based on cost-reward theory, of areal variation in rates of childlessness. Our prediction that childlessness is related to areal differences in alternative roles and other factors that delay childbearing was strongly supported for white wives and generally confirmed for Black wives.

Both vital statistics (Heuser, 1976, demographic and socioeconomic factors to

Table 6A) and census data (U.S. Bureau rates of childlessness at one point in time, of the Census, 1976, Tables 71 and 74) or trends in the rates to changes in marital

the increase was from 13 to 20 per cent. Most of the increase is due to postponing childbearing and does not accurately measure intentions to remain childless. In 1974 only 5 per cent of white wives aged 18-24 and 4 per cent of comparable Blacks said they intended to remain childless. However, these figures are much larger than the comparable 1 per cent of white and Black wives in 1967. Later age at marriage and improvements in the effectiveness of contraceptive methods (Ryder, 1973; Westoff, 1976) explain some portion of the changes, but these explanations have relatively little theoretical interest.

Most demographic analysts of childlessness have studied older wives known to have been at risk of pregnancy and who were childless at the end of their reproductive years. Grabill and Glick (19S9) analyzed published data from the 1910, 1940, and 1950 censuses and the Current Population Surveys of the 1950's. They found, for example, that rates of childlessness are largest for married women with college education, full-time employment, later age at marriage, white-collar husbands, and urban (versus rural) residence. Subsequent researchers have also found that childlessness is

Most previous research has linked either greater in urban areas (Veevers, 1971a)

and is positively related to age at marriage (Mitra, 1966; Veevers, 19716).
Most recent studies using 1960 and 1970 U.S. census data have focused on either racial or income differentials. However, the relationship between income and rates of childlessness is not particularly clear. For example, Kunz et al. (1973), examining 1960 census data for married women aged 35-54, found that the percentage of childlessness usually decreased as husband's income increased. However, Simon (1974), using 1960 census data for white wives in two older cohorts, found that increasing husband's income decreased childlessness only for wives married at age 22 or later; for wives married by age 22, no pattern emerged. In 1970 census data on white wives aged 35-44, married at age 22 or later, in the labor force, and with husbands employed in nonfarm occupations, Poston (1974) found weak support for a positive relationship between rates of childlessness and family income.
For older cohorts, more nonwhites than whites are childless; for younger cohorts, the reverse is true. Attempts to explain the former have focused on whether nonwhites in the older cohorts experienced more involuntary controls on childbearing (Grabill and Glick, 1959; Kunz and Brinkerhoff, 1969; Farley, 1970; Veevers, 1971c; McFalls, 1973).
Three recent exploratory studies of voluntarily childless white couples (Gustavus and Henley, 1971; Veevers, 1973; Nason and Paloma, 1974), all of whom volunteered for the study, showed that most couples had above-average SES, urban residence, low religious affiliation, later age at marriage, and "very egalitarian sex roles with an orientation in which the husband and wife are considered to be of equal value in their relationship with equal levels of authority and equal levels of competence" (Veevers, unpublished).

Also, the decision to remain childless usually followed several decisions to postpone childbearing.
Veevers (1971a, p. 547) suggested that "variations in the incidence of childlessness will occur concomitantly, and in the expected direction, with variations in determinants known to affect fertility." Thus, factors that explain differential fertility should be very close to those that explain variation in rates of childlessness.
In sum, data from the U.S. and Canadian censuses and from exploratory studies fit the cost-reward fertility model used by Scanzoni (1975, Chap. 1) to explain why some couples have fewer and others have more children. The cost-reward model resembles microeconomic models of differential fertility among couples as amended by theorists who believe that couples are under rather stable normative pressure to have at least two children (Blake, 1968; Namboodiri, 1972; 1974; Turchi, 1975; Hout, 1976). However, Scanzoni's emphasis on alternative and changing sex roles suggests that a reduction in fertility norms coupled with increasing opportunities for women may now be allowing previously suppressed variables to affect rates of childlessness. Scanzoni and Polonko (unpublished) have argued that intentional childlessness extends a process that begins when a couple postpones childbearing to pursue rewarding alternatives. Eventually, rewards from the alternatives define childbearing as too costly to experience.
.In the cost-reward framework, analysis of areal variation in childlessness among younger and older women becomes theoretically reasonable, because factors that promote postponement of a first birth should also affect the ultimate rate of childlessness. If the theory is useful, comparative studies of younger and older wives should provide parallel and mutually supportive results.

RESULTS

CHILDLESSNESS OF WHITES
In 1970, the mean rate of childlessness per thousand white wives aged 15-44 was 149; for wives 20-29, it was 233;for those 30-44, it was 64. The close dependence of the rate on age suggests that age-specific analysis may be superior to analysis of all wives aged 15-44. Thus, we show results for ages 15--44but discuss only age-specific

findings. We did not analyze teenage subgroups because only about 10 per cent of women 15--19 were living with a husband; also, in many SAU's, the number of such wives was less than the 300 minimum limit. Within the 30-44 age group, the rate of childlessness is 81 in the low-income group, and 61 and 65 respectively in middle- and upper-income groups. Among wives aged 20-29, mean rates are 261, 194, and 268 for the low-, middle- and upper-income groups, respectively.
Program enrollment, population density, and Southern residence do not differ by age or income group. Mean migration rates are higher in the younger (ages 20-29, 41 per cent) than in the older group (ages 30-44, 21 per cent), but do not vary systematically by income. Labor-force rates are similar in both age groups and increase from about 25 to 50 per cent between the lowest and the highest familyincome categories. The mean loweducation rate is 27 per thousand for younger and 54 for older wives; in the two groups respectively, it declines sharply from 68 to 12 and 161 to 26 as family income increases.
Although most childless wives 20-29 will eventually have one or more children, variables in the cost-reward model should be related to early rates of postponement as well as to rates of childlessness at the end of childbearing years. The middle panel of Table 1 shows explained variance (R2) and metric regression coefficients. For wives aged 20-29 in all family-income categories, 83 per cent of the variance across SAU's is related to the set of independent variables, a level that is nearly matched within two of the three income subgroups. Also, 30 of the 32 coefficients are statistically significant, and all take the sign expected from the cost-reward theory. Thus, the net effect of low education is to reduce rates of childlessness, while school enrollment, labor-force participation, and

higher population density increase rates. Areas with more never-married women also have higher rates, in part because the wives have married at older ages. Also, program enrollment, Southern location, and migration are each positively related to rates of childlessness.
Among white wives aged 30-44, wefind 22 of 28 coefficients are significant. Of the other six, three are related to low education and three to Southern residence. Because the latter had no significant impact on income-specific rates, we reject the view that poor health accounts for higher rates of childlessness among white Southern wives aged 20-29. Explained variance is lower for wives aged 30-44 than for younger women, but it is very low only for the relatively few wives whose family incomes are less than 50 per cent of the median income. Maybe the more effective birth control methods available to the younger cohort and differences in the effectiveness of use partly account for differences in the fit of the model by age and income.
The results in Table 1 provide strong systematic support for the cost-reward theory of childlessness in the married white population.
CHILDLESSNESS OF BLACKS
Among Black wives 20-29, the overall rate of childlessness was 157, with steady increases from 139 to 145 and then 211 as family income rises. The overall rate for the older group was 96, with declines from 107 to 92 and 97 with rising income. Program enrollment levels, log density, and Southern residence differ little between age and income groups.
Migration rates are lower for older wives but similar across income groups. Labor-force participation and low education fluctuate across income groups in both age cohorts. In both age groups, laborforce participation moves from about 39 to

The percentage with low education drops from 29 to 8 and from 13 to 3 per cent in older and younger cohorts, respectively, as family income moves from low to high. Within the two cohorts, school enrollment and age at marriage differ little across income categories.
Table 2 shows that for Black wives 20-29 in all income groups, R2 is 0.55,

indicating good fit to the model. This equation may provide the best test for this age group because factors related to childlessness (low education and laborforce participation) vary greatly by income level. For both age groups, controlling income places severe controls on these independent variables as well as on sample size within SAU's and may therefore reduce the level of explained variance for income groups. Loss of SAU's in income and agespecific subgroups would further bias the results.

variance for Blacks than for whites, the model's impact on childlessness of Blacks is in the expected direction. In 11 of 12 equations, low education is related to lower rates of childlessness. School enrollment, log density, enrollment in familyplanning programs, and age structure are positive, as expected, in all equations; migration is positive in 11 of 12.
Labor-force participation has significant net effects in only three of the eight agespecific equations, but is positive in all eight. Southern residence has no significant impact, and later age at marriage

does not have the positive effect that it exerted on white rates.
As Black women improve control of fertility early in the childbearing years, we expect the cost-reward model to explain increasing amounts of variation in their rates of childlessness. The empirical basis for this argument is that the same model used here yields substantially higher explained variance when Black children ever born (CEB), rather than rates of childlessness, is used as the dependent variable. Also, using CEB substantially reduces the difference in explained vari-
