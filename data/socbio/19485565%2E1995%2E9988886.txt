ABSTRACT: The "New World syndrome" is comprised of disorders that are hypothesized to have resulted from an interaction of the Amerindian genotype with an environment that includes marked changes in lifestyle and diet. The principal component of the syndrome is adult-onset (noninsulin dependent) diabetes mellitus. The purpose of this paper is to describe the emergence of diabetes in a Mexican-origin population. Using a unique file of multiple-cause mortality data, we have computed standardized mortality ratios and relative standardized mortality ratios for Mexican-origin individuals and for other white persons age 30 and over from the 1930's through the middle 1980's. Results for the study population residing in Bexar County (San Antonio), Texas, show that diabetes mortality for Mexican-origin individuals did indeed increase in a pattern consistent with the New World syndrome hypothesis. This study is the first description of the emergence of diabetes using a data set with consistently defined causes of death and demographic characteristics.

Adult-onset (noninsulin dependent or "Type II") diabetes is a major component of a syndrome of diseases reported to have emerged since the 1940's in European-Amerindian admixed groups such as persons of Mexican origin (Weiss et al., 1984; Chakraborty et al., 1986; Gardner et al., 1984). The syndrome is described as "a cascading sequence of increasingly severe and diverse" disorders that includes postpubertal obesity, gallbladder disease, and (sometimes) gallbladder cancer. However, the most prominent disease of the syndrome is adult-onset diabetes mellitus.
Weiss and colleagues have posited that the underlying cause of the syndrome is an interaction between the environment and susceptible genotypes, and more specifically, that these diseases comprise a "New World syn-

drome of metabolic diseases with a genetic and evolutionary basis" that has emerged as a result of culture-gene interaction (Weiss et al., 1984, p. 153). Their hypothesis is that a "genetic susceptibility to this syndrome exists with high frequency in Amerindians, and that this may have arisen by positive natural selection or genetic drift" (Weiss et al., 1984, p. 154) prior to European settlement in the New World.
The genetic susceptibility is a present-day detrimental aspect of what has been called the "thrifty" genotype, characterized by a metabolic efficiency in the utilization of food and by an occurrence as early as the Pleistocene in interaction with an environment of scarce food resources (Neel, 1962, 1982). The susceptibility to the diseases was inherited by persons of European-Amerindian admix-

ture. However, the diseases have only become common with the exposure of the genotypes to contemporary cultural and environment (including nutritional) conditions. The susceptibility is expressed to a greater extent among females than males because of females' childbearing role (Neel, 1962, 1982). '
The purpose of this paper is to trace the emergence of adult-onset diabetes mellitus in a Mexican-origin population by examining trends in mortality associated with diabetes from just before World War II through the early 1980's. None of the earlier research pertaining to adult-onset diabetes encompasses this entire period, and the pattern of development of mortality from diabetes in the Mexican-origin population has never been documented. This study uses a unique collection of "multiple cause" death data for Bexar County (San Antonio), Texas, for estimating mortality associated with diabetes. These data offer the longest uninterrupted series of systematically coded death records available for any Mexican-origin population.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
There are major difficulties in investigations of long-term trends in health status of the Mexican-origin population. No longitudinal health survey data exist for studying the emergence of a disease phenomenon like the New World syndrome or its component conditions. The United States National Health Interview Survey began including a separate identifier for persons of Hispanic origin only since the mid1970's. The first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey aimed

specifically at Hispanics was not undertaken until the early 1980's. Mortality data provide the best continuous source of information about disease conditions in a population and are useful for indicating long-term trends and describing the natural history of a disease (Finch and Zimmet, 1988). However, even mortality data are rarely available over extended periods for the Mexican origin (or other Hispanic) population in the United States.
Mortality data are not ideal for studies of disease etiology, prevalence, or morbidity in a population. Death certificates usually only contain information about conditions judged to be causes of death. Unless they are perceived to have contributed to death, conditions such as obesity, diabetes, or "silent" gallstones (even if diagnosed) would rarely be included on certificates. A "cascading series" of conditions ending in diabetes (or gallbladder cancer), therefore, would ordinarily not be described on death certificates, unless a condition in the series were present at the time of death and was considered to have been associated with death. Depending on the circumstances and causes, a certifying physician may or may not ascertain or perceive that diabetes played a role in a death. It has been estimated to be reported on only 40 per cent of death certificates for persons who were otherwise known to be diabetic (U.S. Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control, 1991, p. 741), and diabetes is selected as the underlying cause of death in only about 25 per cent of the certificates on which it is recorded (Finch and Zimmet, 1988; U.S. Public Health Service Centers for Disease Control, 1989). Other problems with

using cause-of-death data, especially for secular trend studies, are introduced by the major periodic revisions in the classification of diseases which can result in disconcerting aberrations in death rates. Despite these problems, which are by no means unique to diabetes, mortality data remain the best, and in many cases the only, source for historical studies of disease processes in a population.
For present purposes, "multiple cause" death data are most useful. Such data include all conditions listed by the certifying physician as contributing to or associated with a death. For example, all decedents who died with diabetes, as well as from the disease can be included for study--whether the disease was the underlying cause or an associated cause contributing to or merely present at death. Multiple cause data, therefore, give a more complete picture than underlying cause data of the role of a disease in the morbidity and mortality of a population.
Although the data for the present study pertain to a single community, most of the problems with using death data have been overcome. The analysis is based on original death certificates filed in Bexar County, during the years 1935-85, which represent approximately 284,000 deaths. All records were coded according to a single causeof-death classification (ICD-9) (U.S. Public Health Service, 1991) throughout the 51-year period. Every condition recorded on each death record was coded in accordance with National Center for Health Statistics nosological rules by NCHS-trained nosologists. About 12,400 certificates included a mention of diabetes. Because

all records were coded with a single cause-of-death classification, the five decades of data are not affected by the disjunctures in codes that are introduced by periodic classification revisions. The data are, of course, influenced by changing medical knowledge, fashions, and diagnostic techniques, but no more so than other data covering the same period of study.
Demographic information on the death records was also consistently coded according to a single set of codes. Persons of Mexican origin are identified as white persons of Spanish surname, a procedure which past research has shown to yield consistent and reproducible results that in some respects are preferable to those obtained from data on Mexican origin decedents as identified by survivors (Bradshaw and Frisbie, 1987; Rosenwaike and Bradshaw, 1988). Furthermore, the Spanish surname identifier is the only one available prior to about 1980. For comparative purposes, the non-Spanish surname white population is also included, and separate analyses are conducted for males and females. Spanish surname population data were obtained from the decennial censuses of 1940 through 1980, from published reports, public use samples, and special tabulations by the Bureau of the Census. Because of small population size, ethnic groups other than the Spanish surname and non-Spanish surnames whites were excluded.
The subject area of this study-- Bexar County (San Antonio), Texas --is a community in which large Mexican-origin and Anglo-American populations have interacted for many generations. It was chosen for the more general study of Mexican-origin

mortality because virtually all of the resident Hispanic population is of Mexican origin (93 per cent in 1980). Local social and economic conditions and characteristics which may affect trends in mortality, and therefore data for the Mexican origin population of Bexar County may not necessarily produce measures that would be exactly consistent with measures that might be based on data for the Mexican-origin population in the United States as a whole (were such data available). However, it is likely that such local variation in living conditions would have a greater effect on trends in infectious diseases than on those of a genetic origin. There is no reason to believe that changes in diet and other factors associated with the emergence of the New World syndrome diseases in Bexar County would be significantly different from other large metropolitan communities in the United States.
All decedents aged 30 and over who died with diabetes mellitus (ICD-9, code 250), whether or not it was the underlying cause of death, are included in this study. ICD-9 allows for several categories of diabetes according to complications (codes 250.0-250.9). The disease may be further distinguished clinically between noninsulin(adult onset) or insulin-dependent diabetes, but these codes are not routinely used in coding death certificates, and they are not available in our data set. Noninsulin-dependent diabetes, the form associated with the New World syndrome, accounts for about 90 per cent of clinical cases (Kuller et al., 1986). However, it is very rare for physicians to make such distinctions on death certificates, regardless of age or other characteristic of the decedent.

As a means for partially excluding insulin-dependent cases for present purposes, only decedents aged 30 and over were included. Undoubtedly, some insulin dependent cases died at ages beyond 30, but the numbers of such persons would be small compared to those who died with the non-insulin dependent form of the disease.
METHODS OF ANALYSIS
Standardized mortality ratios (SMR's) and relative standardized mortality ratios (RSMR's, i.e., the ratio of the cause-specific SMR's to the SMR for all causes) were computed for diabetes for persons of Spanish surname and other white persons by sex. Because of the relatively small annual numbers of cause-specific deaths in the early part of the study period, the number of observed deaths was averaged over the ten years around the decennial census dates. The standard rates are the average cause, age, and sexspecific rates for the United States white population, 1979-81. A SMR of 1.00 implies that the number of observed deaths in the study population equals the number that would be expected if the study population experienced the specific rates of the standard population. The same standard rates were used for computing SMR's for both underlying and multiple cause. Multiple cause SMR's, therefore, are "inflated" relative to the underlying cause SMR's by the ratio of total mentions to underlying cause mentions. The latter ratio is also presented because it suggests (but does not necessarily measure ) the relative "lethality" of the disease in the different populations over time.

SMR's alone are useful indicators of mortality. However, their primary usefulness for present purposes is in illustrating trends over time, not in their absolute values in comparison with the United States white population of 1980. As Kupper et al. (1978) suggest, the major interest may lie in the relative importance of a specific cause, particularly in comparing populations that have much different overall death rates. Thus, the "correction" for relative importance of a specific cause demonstrated through the RSMR is of considerable utility (Kupper et al., 1978), especially for illustrating the changes in disease patterns as overall mortality declines. The RSMR for total mentions of diabetes can be interpreted as a measure of the relative prevalence of the disease in the deceased population.1
Males and females were standardized separately with the respective U.S. male and female age and underlying cause-specific rates. For this reason, the standardized measures presented for males and females are not comparable except with respect to trends, i.e., comparisons are possible within sex, but not between sex categories. For each sex, a SMR of 1.00 indicates that mortality due to a cause was equal to the United States white population mortality from that cause in 1980.
Separate measures were initially computed for Mexican Americans and
1The RSMR is equal to the observed prevalence divided by the expected prevalence of a cause. In this instance, observed prevalence is measured by the ratio of total mentions of diabetes as a cause of death to the total number of deaths (i.e., deaths due to all causes). Expected prevalence is the ratio of expected mentions to expected deaths from all causes.

Mexican immigrants (i.e., persons born in the United States and Mexico, respectively). However, there was essentially no difference between the two throughout the study period in either trend or magnitude, and therefore, separate measures are not presented. The subject of nativity is discussed further in the results section.
Because the focus of this paper is on the emergence of diabetes as a cause of death, primary emphasis is placed on measures based on total mentions of diabetes. Nevertheless, there is considerable interest in the role of diabetes as an underlying, as opposed to an associated cause of death. Ratios of total mentions to underlying cause mentions of diabetes are also presented and discussed.
RESULTS
Trends in standardized mortality ratios for persons of Spanish surname (without regard to nativity) and other white persons are illustrated for females and males in Table 1 and Figure 1. Measures are restricted to persons age 30 and over. The table presents SMR's for all causes, SMR's and RSMR's for diabetes (total mentions), and ratios of total mentions of diabetes to underlying cause mentions. The figures show some of the same data in graphic form. The graphs provide a better perspective for examining the emergence of mortality from this component of the New World syndrome.
As described elsewhere, general mortality levels in the Spanish surname population converged with those for other white persons from 1935-84 (Bradshaw and Frisbie, 1992; Carey et al., 1992). Overall mortality trends, of

per cent higher than the SMR for other white women at the time. Nearly all of the improvement in all-cause mortality among other white males and females occurred from 1935-44 to 1945-54. In general, there was little difference in adult Spanish surname and other white male mortality throughout the study

period, a finding repeatedly made in the studies cited earlier which focused on more recent periods. The similarity in male mortality arises from offsetting differences in death rates from different causes. Non-Spanish surname white males have consistently been found to have higher mortality from

heart disease and cancer, while Spanish surname males have had higher mortality from diabetes, homicide, motor vehicle accidents, and other causes.
Unlike mortality from all causes, standardized mortality ratios for total mentions of diabetes increased in each population--other white as well as Mexican origin--reaching a peak in 1970, the central year of 1965-74 (Table 1 and Figure 1). The graphs demonstrate the widening gap in diabetes mortality between the Mexican origin and other white populations. The differences in total mention SMR's were quite small at the beginning of the study period. In 1940, the SMR for Mexican origin females exceeded that of other white women by only about 10 per cent. The corresponding excess for Mexican origin males was virtually nil. By 1970, however, the total-mention SMR's for Spanish surname women and men were 8.99 and 6.82, respectively, indicating that the observed number of persons dying with diabetes was nearly 9 and 7 times greater than would have been expected based on the 1980 United States age-specific death rates for diabetes as an underlying cause. The corresponding 1970 measures for other white females and males were 3.69 and 4.19, respectively. Between 1970 and 1980, diabetes SMR's for all four groups declined to levels below the 1970 peak--a trend which is consistent with that in the United States white population. The widening gap between the two populations in diabetes SMR's is attributable to a more rapid increase in Spanish surname diabetes mortality. The annual rate of change from 1940 to 1970 averaged 3.8 per cent for Spanish surname

females and 4.4 per cent for males, compared with 1.1 and 2.8 per cent for other white women and men.
Nativity--i.e., whether a decedent was born in the United States or Mexico--is a variable that was expected to be important in studying an emergent disease pattern associated with population exposure to changing environmental (in this case nutritional) conditions. In fact, the diabetes SMR's of persons born in Mexico and the United States are nearly identical, and, therefore, as noted earlier, are not presented separately. These results were not expected. Though we have no data that tell us how long Mexico-born decedents had lived in the United States, we had expected that U.S.-born persons would have had higher diabetes mortality because they would presumably have had more time to become acculturated to United States nutritional customs. A differential was expected, especially for the early decades of the study period, on the assumption that nutritional patterns in Mexico and the United States on average were probably less similar then than in later times. The measures presented in this paper are period-specific rather then cohortspecific. Further research may indicate that different birth cohorts have followed somewhat different mortality trajectories with respect to diabetes. Available information suggests that diabetes mortality has also been increasing in Mexico, at least since the 1970s (Zarate, 1991) and probably earlier.
Trends in relative standardized mortality ratios (RSMR's) are depicted in Figure 2. Only RSMR's for total mentions of diabetes are shown because the primary interest is in the changing prevalence in diabetes in the deceased

population. The results are instructive. Diabetes was of approximately equal relative importance as a cause of death in all four sex and ethnic groups until 1950, after which it rose rapidly forthe Spanish surname population, and to a much smaller degree in the other white population. Among Spanish surname women the 1980 RSMR for diabetes

was over 5 times that of 1940. The RSMR for other white women increased only 1.9 times during the same period. Even though the mortality level of diabetes, as measured by the SMR, fell for all groups after 1970, the relative importance of the disease in the Spanish surname population continued to increase. The latter finding is

Vol. 42, No. 1-2

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:46 08 December 2015

probably the result of reduced mortality from heart disease, which occurred in all four populations (Stern et al., 1987); that is, as death rates from heart disease fell, the relative importance of diabetes increased. However, it is noteworthy that the relative importance of diabetes declined in the nonHispanic population.
A different view of the "prevalence" of diabetes in the deceased population is presented as percentages of decedents with a mention of the disease on their death certificate (Table 1). These figures are not standardized for age, or expressed in relation to expected deaths, but they are straightforward and informative with respect to the relative importance of diabetes in association with death. These numbers again confirm the disproportionate rise in diabetes in the Mexican origin population from the 1930's to the 1980's. During 1975-84, 16.5 per cent of all Mexican origin female decedents were recorded as dying with diabetes, up from 3.4 per cent in 1934-44. Figures for the other females were 5.6 per cent in 1975-84 and 3.1 per cent in 1935-44.
Ratios of total mentions (TM) of diabetes to underlying cause (UC) mentions for persons of Spanish surname and other white persons are shown in Table 1 and Figure 3. Over the period 1935-85, a general upward trend in TM/UC ratios would be expected for all groups assuming that all would have benefitted from better medical management of diabetes (though not necessarily to the same degree). Independent of such a secular trend these measures suggest the relative "lethality" of diabetes. In a population in which diabetes is more commonly the underlying cause of death the ratio is

nearer 1.0 compared with a population in which the disease is more often listed as a contributing ("associated") cause. Figure 3, as expected, shows a consistent upward trend in TM/UC ratios for all groups. However, the ratios for other white persons are always higher than those for Spanish surname persons, indicated that once contracted, diabetes may be more often fatal in the Spanish surname population. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that attrition through mortality would be higher among genetically susceptible persons who are exposed to an adverse environment that is conducive to the development of the disease (Dowse et al., 1991). It is noteworthy that the ratio of total mentions to underlying cause mentions is always higher for non-Spanish surname men than women, and this is usually the case in the Spanish surname population. This findingis to be expected based on earlier work on sex differences in diabetes (Neel, 1982).
DISCUSSION
A consistent finding from research on Mexican Americans is that the burden of diabetes as a cause of disability and death is very high. In an early study, Ellis (1962) listed diabetes mellitus as one of the leading causes of death among the Spanish surname population of San Antonio in 1950. More recent studies of mortality and morbidity have confirmed this finding in several other populations, as well as San Antonio (Flegal et al., 1991; Hazuda et al., 1988; Stern et al., 1991; Diehl and Stern, 1989; Bradshaw et al., 1986; Bradshaw and Frisbie, 1992; Bradshaw and Fonner, 1978; Carey et

al., 1992; Mitchell et al., 1990; Rosenwaike and Bradshaw, 1989). The importance of diabetes in Mexico has also been documented. Interestingly, it is in those areas of Mexico that are linked most closely with the United States that death rates from the disease are highest (Zarate, 1991; Bradshaw,

1991). In both Mexico and the U.S. Mexican-origin population the cost of medical management and disability from diabetes will undoubtedly remain disproportionately high and is likely to increase.
The results presented in this article add historical depth and continuity to

previously published work on diabetes mortality in the Mexican origin population. They show that diabetes emerged as a major cause of death in the Mexican origin population relative to the other white population after 1940, both in terms of risk of death as measured by the SMR and in relative importance as measured by the RSMR. The results also suggest that the disease is more lethal in the Mexican-origin population, as indicated by the ratio of total mentions to underlying cause. The decline in SMR's after 1970 in all groups is probably attributable to better medical management of diabetes, though there are indications from studies of diabetes-susceptible populations elsewhere that declines may be the result of mortal attrition of the more susceptible of the subgroups (Dowse et al., 1991). Also, the susceptibility of the Mexican origin population may be declining because changing genetic composition of the birth cohorts represented successive decades of data.
The results described here appear to support the New World syndrome hypothesis insofar as they are consistent with expectations based on that hypothesis. The hypothesis of the emergence of the New World syndrome would lead us to expect that there should be a more or less steady increase in mortality from the component diseases in the Mexican origin population, particularly in females, and that the mortality differential between them and other white persons would tend to increase over time. Corollaries of the New World syndrome hypothesis predict that the effect of the "thrifty" genotype is stronger for females in general because of their child-

bearing role and that this effect is stronger still for females with the longest exposure to contemporary environmental conditions. As expected, the mortality data support these corollaries. The diabetes mortality of the Spanish surname females is higher than the diabetes mortality of any other group whether considered by sex or nativity.
The finding that diabetes mortality (as measured by the SMR) was essentially similar among persons born in Mexico and in the United States is inconsistent with the hypothesis of the New World syndrome. Assuming that Mexican Americans would have had virtually lifelong exposure to mainstream U.S. dietary patterns, the New World syndrome hypothesis suggests that their mortality should be higher than that of Mexican immigrants. However, recent mortality patterns in Mexico itself show that those regions of the country where contacts with the United States are likely to be closest are precisely those areas with the highest diabetes mortality (Bradshaw, 1991; Zarate, 1991). While the present study does not establish a clear link between the nativity of Spanish surname decedents and death from non-insulin dependent diabetes, the association of human migration with diabetes will remain an interesting one for future research as diabetes-susceptible populations move into different social environments or otherwise interact and acquire the nutritional habits of other populations.
Finally, this article addresses only one component of the New World syndrome. The syndrome construct has been used here primarily as a guide to research and to give meaning to the results for diabetes mortality. However,

we have not dealt with thesyndrome as a pattern of diseases, except in a cursory fashion. Further work remains to be done in relation to the syndrome as a pattern of diseases leading to death. The syndrome is described as a series of etiologically linked chronic diseases. For example, gallbladder disease predisposes some persons to diabetes. Since both conditions are chronic-- i.e., gallbladder disease would continue as diabetes developed--both diseases should be present at death. If the syndrome exists, onewould expect to find at least some persons who died with a mention of at least two of the component conditions present at death. In our database such a combination of conditions is very rare. Less than 1 per cent of persons who died with either disease had both diabetes

and gallbladder disease recorded at the time of death. The implications of this finding for the hypothesis of the New World syndrome as a syndrome are unclear. The absence of the combination of conditions maybe an artifact ofthe timing of cholecystectomies, a problem in cause of death reporting, or the dominance of diabetes among the New World diseases.
