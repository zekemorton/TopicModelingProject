ABSTRACT: The theories of demographic transition and epidemiologic transition provide vehicles for the examination of Navajo fertility, mortality, and growth patterns. The Navajo population is found to be growing rapidly due to decreased mortality and fertility rates which have declined but remain twice as high as U.S. rates. Infectious diseases are now less important as a factor in mortality, but remain a problem larger than that in the overall United States. Rates of death from degenerative diseases have not yet become a great problem among the Navajo, but mortality from social pathology (accidents, alcoholism, suicide, homicide, and cirrhosis of the liver) is considerably higher than that in the general United States. Discussion of each of these specific behaviors and possible etiological factors are presented. In general, it can be said that the Navajo Indians represent a group which is in the transitional stage of both the demographic and epidemiologic transition, although some exceptions are noted.

mographic transition with the idea that part of the transition to modernity is a change in the mix of diseases that cause the majority of a society's deaths. In developing societies, people die at an early age from infectious and parasitic diseases, while in more developed populations, people live longer but are subject to degenerative and man-made diseases (Omran, 1971). The three stages of the epidemiologic transition are: (1) the age of pestilence and famine, (2) the age of receding pandemics, and (3) the age of degenerative and man-made diseases (Omran, 1971,p. 516). As a society undergoes modernization, it will progress through these various stages.
Most advocates of these approaches caution that the patterns noted are broad and vary considerably according to place and time. The conditions prevailing in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries on which the theory of demographic transition were based are different now; accordingly, the timing of the stages of epidemiologic transition may vary considerably. The idea of transition, however, can be applied to examine the current morbidity and vital statistics of the Navajo Indians.
That the Navajos are in the midst of rapid social and economic change seems indisputable (Kunitz, 1981). The 1970 census reported the per capita income of Navajos as $800. In 1980, the Navajo tribe reports the amount had risen to about $2,300. Coal trains, uranium mines, oil rigs, and giant excavating equipment attest to the economic activity around the reservation. Driving across the reservation, outsiders are often impressed by the number of new cars and pickup trucks on the roads. But this change is highly variable and only affects certain aspects of (and individuals in) Navajo society. Fewer than half

of the homes on the reservation have piped water and about one in four has a telephone (May, Broudy, et al., 1977). Wool production, rug weaving, and silversmithing still figure in the local economy, even though wage labor is increasingly important. Most Navajos still speak Navajo as their primary language, and their traditional medicine and religious practices thrive. Nonetheless, it is true that many Navajos now have advanced educational degrees, and virtually all use modern medicine to some extent (Stewart et al., 1980). Such contrast between traditional values and modernization are apparent all over the Navajo reservation (Kunitz, 1977).
Within this context, health and demographic changes are occurring in various ways. In the following paper, the population structure, fertility, and mortality patterns of the Navajo will be described as they relate to this unique sociocultural situation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The total Navajo population in this paper was estimated from 1970 census data. It was then revised upward based on a renumeration of three local areas carried out in 1976. Population estimates for each year were made based on the net change in county population. The age and sex distribution is based on tribal enrollment statistics compiled by the Navajo tribe.
Mortality and natality data for Navajos are compiled by Indian Health Service (IHS) from death and birth certificates. After final statistics are tabulated for the United States by the National Center for Health Statistics, IHS obtains data for communities which lie within its jurisdiction. Causes of death are coded according to standard

practice using the International Classification of Diseases, Eighth edition.
The Indian Health Service provides free comprehensive hospital, clinic, and community health services to Navajos residing on or near the reservation. Although Navajos may choose to obtain health care from private providers, the majority utilize IHS facilities (Stewart et al., 1980). For each patient visit and admission, standard IHS care forms are completed, which provides an extensive data base.
POPULATION
The Navajo population is structurally different from the U.S. population as a whole. In 1978, the median age was 16.4 years as compared to 29 years for the United States. The following pyramids graphically demonstrate the difference. Until ten years ago, the Navajo pyramid had a triangular shape associated with a developing country. Pyramids for underdeveloped countries such as Costa Rica in 1950 (Demeny, 1974) and Madagascar in 1968 (Dadzie, 1968) show a similar triangular pattern.
Currently, the Navajo pyramid has the indented base for the lowest age groups which reflects a decline in fertility in the last decade. The "waist" reflects the decline in births during World War II; and the bulge, the postwar baby boom. The baby boom was great among the Navajo with large increases in fertility which paralleled the U.S. pattern. One difference, however, was that there was a short lag in onset and a five-year lag in peak. A second difference is that the birth rates during the Navajo baby boom were twice as high as U.S. rates throughout the period (Indian Health Service, 1970).
The current reservation population (1980) of the Navajo is 146,366. Of this

total, males constitute 70,408 or 48 per cent, and females 75,957 or 52 per cent (Indian Health Service, 1980). Tribal enrollment for the Navajo is 162,303 which indicates 10 per cent live off the reservation. Much of the off-reservation population lives in the reservation border towns of Gallup, Grants, and Farmington, New Mexico, and Flagstaff, Winslow, and Holbrook, Arizona. The Navajo population is still growing rapidly as will be detailed below.
FERTILITY
The Navajo fertility rate has declined considerably since 1965, from 55.4 to 33.1 in 1978. The annual per cent of growth of the Navajo in 1965 was 4.7 per cent, and from 1965-67 the average growth was 4.2 per cent. With the later growth rate as a constant, the Navajo population would have doubled every 17 years! An examination of Table 1 shows the steady drop since that time. For the four most recent years for which there are data (1975-78), the population growth has slowed to 2.5 per cent to 2.7 per cent annually. This is significantly lower than the middle 1960's. But this rate of growth still indicates that a doubling of population will occur in 26 to 28 years. By comparison, the U.S. population in 1976 was growing at a rate of 0.6 per cent, which will take over one hundred years to double. Therefore, the Navajo population is still growing over four times as rapidly as the general U.S. population.
Other reproduction measures also reflect higher fertility among the Navajo. The Total Fertility Rate (TFR) for the Navajo in 1975-77 was 4,616 compared to the U.S. rate (1976) of 1,768. In other words, the typical Navajo woman would have 4.6 children during her childbearing years while the

diseases should be leading causes of death in a developing population, while man-made and degenerative diseases are leading causes of death in developed countries.
Table 3 also indicates that accidents are the chief cause of death followed by heart disease, cancer, influenza, and pneumonia. Notable by their absence are malnutrition and many infectious diseases. Although influenza and pneumonia are still problems, it appears that the Navajo have passed the stage of pestilence and famine and are in the later phase of the stage of epidemic infectious disease (see Omran, 1971,p. 516). A recent study (Samet, 1980) of respiratory disease in New Mexico (64,580 Navajo lived in New Mexico in 1980) reinforced Indian Health Service statistics in showing much higher mortality from TB, influenza, and pneumonia among the Indians than among the Hispanic or white populations. An examination of Navajo tuberculosis deaths by age indicates that all deaths are in the older categories indicating a residual and waning problem.
The high rate of accidents compared

to the U.S. rate and the fact that accidents lead all causes suggests that Navajos are beginning the last stage of the transition in which man-made and degenerative diseases predominate. Among the Navajo, the agent of this problem may be the combination of new wealth, which allows people to buy cars, and their culture which has not integrated safety practices or placed strict social penalties on periodic alcohol abuse among the young (Katz and May, 1979). The process of change and modernization may also be a source of stress which results in high accident rates (May and Katz, 1981) and other behavioral problems. In 1978, approximately 40 per cent of Navajo deaths were the result of social and environmental pathologies (in categories of mental, accidents, suicide, and homicide). Fifty per cent of male deaths and only 27 per cent of female deaths were overtly social- or behavior-related.
Alcoholism deaths are extremely high as shown in Table 3. The Navajo age-adjusted rate is twenty times the national rate. But there may be some

seen that the overall infant death rates are quite close. The low percentages for Navajos probably reflect a tendency to lump infant deaths into "all-other" categories. It is clear, however, that the current Navajo rates due to diarrhea and respiratory diseases are relatively lower than the rates for congenital anomalies and perinatal causes. This is also true for the Puffer and Serrano (1973) sample from California.

late to progress in the demographic and epidemiologic transition. The Navajo reservation, after many years of isolation, is now an area of great economic and social change. The effect of this change on the vital patterns of the tribe is becoming obvious.
In only the last two decades, there has been a decided change on the Navajo reservation from a subsistence economy to an increased dependence on wage labor. This change has been very rapid due to the imposition of outside capital and interests on the Navajo. Federal monies and corporate funds have come in great quantities to the Navajo as a group and effected rapid changes in the Navajo reservation and the entire economic system.
Socially, change has been uneven. It has been rapid in some areas while in others the old cultural traditions remain quite constant (Kunitz, 1977). Some authors have noted an increasing trend in the Navajo family structure (Kunitz and Levy, 1981) from extended to nuclear. The functions of the extended family are becoming less important which is common in societies undergoing a demographic transition. The living standard, particularly in younger wage-workoriented families, is improving. Food in an adequate nutritional supply from consumer and government sources is more readily available. In fact, overconsumption of "junk food" is now a major concern of some health officials. The tribal government and its bureaucratic entities have been growing rapidly and have been constantly changed to keep up with the pressing needs of modernization. But in all of this change, much remains constant. Values which guide Navajo behavior have been somewhat slower to change. Many of the old traditions remain.

portion of the population, since many Navajos do not drink at all (Levy and Kunitz, 1974). Those who do drink persistently are in many cases socially ostracized. This practice may produce higher death rates from these causes than if rehabilitation were a stronger norm (Levy and Kunitz, 1974). Chronic alcoholism deaths, then, also relate strongly to the social and cultural values of alcohol use and alcoholism.
In summary, it seems evident that the Navajo are also in transition regarding epidemiologic variables. Many disease patterns exist which are influenced by older traditional patterns and conditions of social life and values. But new patterns of death are emerging which are man-made and are a result of modernization and the existing mix of sociocultural elements and values in contemporary Navajo life.
In his article on epidemiologic transition, Omran (1971) indicated that a society which has a life expectancy of over 50 years had reached the last stage of transition, the age of degenerative and man-made diseases. He also stated that in this stage the birth and death rates were below 20 per 1,000. The Navajo experience indicates a more complex or slightly different pattern. The Navajo are now less prone to die from infectious diseases than in previous years. Degenerative diseases may be becoming more important, and man-made diseases (especially behavior-related) are outstanding problems. The Navajo life expectancy of 65 years places them in Omran's last stage as does the death rate which is well below 20 per 1,000. But the fertility rate and population growth remain high. The Navajo straddle Stage Two and Stage Three of Omran's theory. They are not completely through the latter stages of the age of receding pan-

demics and are in some ways only beginning the age of degenerative and man-made diseases.
The Navajo experience, then, shows exceptions to Omran's theory in two ways. First, the continued high rate of growth and fertility may reflect the fact that the health care system and modern medicine were rapidly implemented on the Reservation independent of intrinsic Navajo values and the process of modernization. The low fertility values associated with modernization have not caught up with the rapid mortality decline. In other words, the federal health care system was imposed in a manner independent of the other modernization factors. As has been shown with many other groups, particularly underdeveloped countries, infectious diseases are more easily cured and mortality more quickly lowered than fertility patterns. This is particularly true when the health care improvements are imposed from a force external to the society's own culture.
The second exception to Omran's theory is indicated by the differential rate of progression in the man-made and degenerative diseases. The Navajo rates of death from social pathologies have risen quite rapidly while only small increases are being registered in the degenerative diseases. This finding might be expected, but the magnitude of the rise in these man-made diseases should be emphasized. In the Navajo case, social conditions and social items (i.e., wage labor opportunities, alcohol availability, motor vehicles, etc.) are changing rapidly, but the values surrounding their use and safe use are adopted slowly, if at all. Therefore, with rapid modernization, socially induced mortality and morbidity increase much more rapidly than degenerative diseases.
