ABSTRACT: This study utilizes an ecological approach based on census tracts of residence to examine the relationship between infant mortality and socioeconomic status in metropolitan Ohio at two points in time (1959-61 and 1969-71). The data presented clearly indicate that the infant mortality rate continues to exhibit a pronounced inverse association with a wide variety of socioeconomic variables. Although there were some notable exceptions and/or variations from the general patterns, a basic inverse relationship was generally found to be characteristic of both neonatal and postnatal components of infant mortality, for both males and females, and for both major exogenous and endogenous causes of death. Of all the variables examined, the one factor that emerged as the strongest and most consistent determinant of census tract variations in infant mortality was the proportion of low income families. Thus, the overriding conclusion suggested by this study is that in spite of such things as continued advances in medicine and public health, the expansion of a variety of social programs during the 1960's, and the recent resumption of a downward trend in the overall infant mortality rate, there has been little if any progress in achieving more equitable life chances for the economically deprived segments of our population.

relationship, the conclusion was inevitably the same: the lower the socioeconomic status of a group, the higher its infant mortality rate (Newsholme, 1910; Woodbury, 1925). The results of research carried out during the postWorld War II period indicated that the infant mortality rate was also extremely sensitive to socioeconomic differences on an international level (i.e., the more developed the country the lower its infant mortality rate) (Hauser, 1959). In fact, it was even suggested that the infant mortality rate was so highly correlated with economic status that it could

well and Hutchinson, 1975; Yang and Pendleton, 1980), the same degree of consistency has not been observed within the modern urban-industrial world. In the United States, for example, the existence of a marked inverse association between a wide variety of socioeconomic indexes and level of mortality in infancy was consistently observed until the 1950's, at which time a number of isolated studies reached conclusions that suggested the traditional relationship was breaking down (Willie, 1959; Donabedian, et al., 1965). The weakening of the association at this time

was attributed to the fact that the majority of infant deaths occurred during the neonatal period and were due to causes related more to the physiological processes of gestation and birth rather than socioeconomic factors. It was even suggested at this time that we could anticipate an even greater convergence of class differences in infant mortality as continued progress in health care filtered down to the lower socioeconomic groups and led to further declines in the more sensitive postneonatal death rate (Stockwell, 1962).
In contrast to the optimistic projections of this earlier time, the results of research based on data for more recent periods suggest that such a convergence has not taken place and that the inverse association between infant mortality and socioeconomic status continues to be just as pronounced as ever, if not more so. Recent studies in the United States that have reached such a conclusion include several based on individual level data (e.g., Shapiro et al., 1968; Shah and Abbey, 1971; Bendor et al., 1971; MacMahon et al., 1972; Gortmaker, 1979) as well as studies using the more common ecological approach (e.g., Kitagawa and Hauser, 1973; National Academy of science, 1973;Stockwell and Laidlaw, 1977; Markides and Barnes, 1977; Adamchak and Stockwell, 1978; Adamchak, 1979; Brooks, 1975a, 1975b, 1978,1980).
At the same time that research has documented the persistence of an inverse differential, there is evidence that a number of new patterns may have emerged in recent years. For example, although some studies suggest that there is a fairly consistent linear gradient to the relationship (Markides and Barnes, 1977; Davies, 1980), others have revealed a tendency for there to be some convergence in infant mortality rates

among all but the lowest socioeconomic groups (MacMahon et al., 1972; Kitagawa and Hauser, 1973; Antonovsky and Bernstein, 1977). Another change for which there is increasing evidence concerns the growing importance of the neonatal component of infant mortality as a major contributor to the overall differential (Antonovsky and Bernstein, 1977; Thind et al., 1979; Adamchak, 1979); but here again there is conflicting evidence (Markides and McFarland, 1982). Given the changes that have apparently occurred in the relationship over the past generation, as well as the persistence of some disagreements concerning the precise nature of the relationship, it is clear that this subject is one that merits additional research.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
PURPOSE AND SCOPE
The primary objective of the research reported on here is to measure and describe the associations between infant mortality and socioeconomic status in metropolitan Ohio (Dayton, Columbus, and Toledo) at two points in time (1959-61 and 1969-71) in order to throw additional light on the nature and extent of the changes that are taking place in the traditional inverse relationship. Attention is focused on the nature of the relationship not only for total infant mortality but also for its two major components (neonatal and postneonatal mortality). Finally, an attempt is made to assess the role played by particular causes of death on the nature and magnitude of observed socioeconomic mortality differentials in infancy.

such a way as to achieve a relatively equal number of tracts in each of five status groups. Again we present only partial results of this phase of the analysis (see Table 2). These data suggest the following conclusions.
(a) In 1960 there was a pronounced inverse relationship between infant mortality levels and both Low Income Families and Per cent Black, but not for Working Mothers.
(b) In 1970, a clear inverse relationship characterized all three socioeconomic measures. While the changed situation with respect to Working Mothers supported the hypothesis advanced elsewhere concerning the emerging importance of such family status variables (Adamchak and Stockwell, 1978), the observed relationship was much weaker than that characterizing either Low Income Families or Per cent Black.

(c)In contrast to 1960, the pattern revealed in 1970 did not follow a consistent inverse gradient. Rather, it was one in which the highest and lowest status areas were sharply differentiated from the middle three with respect to infant mortality rates, while among the three intermediate areas there was a clear tendency for the death rates to merge together.
(d) In all sections of this analysis it was clear that Low Income Families was the most consistent in revealing the existence of an inverse association between infant mortality and socioeconomic status.

family economic status hasconsistently been identified as a major determinant of infant mortality ever since the relationship was first examined (Woodbury, 1925), led to a decision to concentrate on this measure as the major independent variable. The highlights of this broader analysis may be summarized briefly asfollows:
(a) General Trends: The data presented inTable 3clearly show that there was a very strong andconsistent inverse association between infant mortality (total, neonatal and postneonatal) and the overall income status of residential areas in Ohio in 1960. The basic inverse pattern was seen to characterize both males and females, butit was especially pronounced andmost consistent for the former; and inallcases it clearly characterized both neonatal and postneonatal mortality, although it was notably stronger for thelatter.

By 1970, although a basic inverserelationship was apparent, there was a clear converging tendency among the middle areas. The overall pattern for both sexes with respect to the total infant and neonatal mortality was for Areas I and V to be even more widely separated than in 1960 in terms of low and high death rates while theArea II, III, and IV rates tended to converge around those for All Areas. For postneonatal mortality there continued to be a generally consistent inversegradient across allfive social areas, with the rates inArea Vbeing three tofive times as great as corresponding rates observed in Area I.
(b) Cause of Death Analysis: The purpose of the cause of death analysis was to seeif the general inverse nature of the relationship between infant mortality and socioeconomic status couldbe explained largely interms of a particular

cause or cause group, or if it more or less characterized all the major causes of infant death. Although it would have been desirable to examine specific causes, the fact that a marked reduction in the number of cases enhances the likelihood of rate instability when specific causes are considered necessitated basing this analysis on a comparison of the role of endogenous as opposed to exogenous causes of death. The former causes, those most closely associated with the physiological processes of gestation and birth, comprised the following specific groups: congenital anomalies, birth injuries, postnatal asphyxiation, immaturity, and other diseases peculiar to early infancy. The latter exogenous causes, or those furthest removed from the actual birth process and thus more likely to be

influenced by differences in social and environmental conditions, included the acute infectious and parasitic disease, accidents, and a residual group comprising all other causes.
The general cause-specific infant death rates for the two metropolitan aggregates included in this study are presented in Tables 4 and 5. A detailed examination of these data suggests that two broad conclusions are clearly applicable. First, as would be expected, the general pattern is one where endogenous causes are predominantly associated with neonatal mortality (e.g., 90 per cent or more of all neonatal deaths were attributed to one or another of the endogenous causes), whereas the exogenous causes are more commonly associated with postneonatal mortality,

though to a somewhat lesser degree than in the former instance (i.e., 70 per cent or more of the postneonatal deaths in Ohio were due to exogenous causes). Second, it would appear that the general patterns of the basic inverse relationship between infant mortality and socioeconomic status described in the preceding sections are characteristic of both endogenous and exogenous causes of death--most especially of those segments of infant mortality to which each is a major contributor. That is, in the case of the former causes, levels of total and neonatalmortality tend to vary inversely across income areas while the postneonatal endogenous death rates exhibit little or no discernible pattern in

their association with socioeconomic status. Conversely, for the exogenous cause group the total infant and postneonatal mortality rates are inversely related to income status, whereas the neonatal death rates tend to vary in an erratic manner across the several social areas.
Overall then, although there are obvious numerous variations, and although there is some problem with empty cells and the potential instability of infant death rates, the data presented in Tables 4 and 5 clearly indicate that the basic inverse relationship between infant mortality and socioeconomic status cannot be attributed solely (or even largely) to either cause group.

there are more deaths due to endogenous causes (and in the neonatal period), it is clear that variations in the death rates for both broad cause groups (notably for that component of infant mortality where each exerts the greatest influence) are characterized by a similar inverse socioeconomic differential.
DISCUSSION
The major findings and conclusions of the research reported on here are generally similar to those of a number of other studies that have been carried out in recent years, and they provide further evidence in support of many of the conclusions reached by others pertaining both to the persistence of a basic inverse

association between socioeconomic status and infant mortality and to the emergence of a number of different patterns and/or changes within the general inverse relationship. Some of the more important commonalities may be summarized briefly as follows:
(1) Persistence of Inverse Association: The present study confirms the findings of other studies based on data for the 1960's and later (or during the time when the infant mortality rate had resumed its downward trend) that socioeconomic status continues to be an important determinant of levels of mortality in infancy. While there is some evidence to support earlier hypotheses pertaining to a convergence of social class infant mortality rates during the

36 Stockwell and Wicks Social Biology

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

late 1940's and early 1950's, the studies undertaken since then clearly reaffirm the existence of a marked inverse association between socioeconomic status and infant mortality. Further, there is general agreement that despite the recent emergence of a marked neonatal differential (see Section 3 below) the relationship continues to be most pronounced for the postneonatal death rate.
(2) Blurring of the Association: Although it is clear that a basic inverse differential continues to characterize the relationship between socioeconomic status and infant mortality, there is also a growing body of evidence from studies based on a variety of methods and socioeconomic indexes to indicate that the differential is no longer characterized by a consistent pattern of linearity across all socioeconomic groups. Rather, the emerging pattern revealed by most of the recent American studies is one in which the lowest socioeconomic group consistently experiences much higher infant mortality rates than the general population but in which there was essentially no difference among the upper social classes (Antonovsky, 1967;MacMahon et al., 1972; Kitagawa and Hauser, 1973; Antonovsky and Bernstein, 1977). The present study found a consistent inverse gradient in Ohio for the 1960 period, but by 1970 the association had begun to blur. At that time the general pattern was one where the highest and lowest social areas clearly stood out as having the lowest and highest infant mortality rates but where there was a marked convergence around the mean of the mortality rates in the three intermediate areas.
Overall then, it appears that there is widespread agreement on the severe mortality disadvantage characterizing the lowest socioeconomic groups. Fur-

ther, there is widespread support for the conclusion that some kind of converging trend is evident among the higher socioeconomic groups in the population.
(3) TheImportance of Neonatal Mortality: The findings of the present study also reveal the emerging importance of neonatal mortality differentials as a contributor to the overall inverse association between socioeconomic status and infant mortality. In sharp contrast to the situation a generation ago, there is a growing body of evidence to indicate that the neonatal death rate appears to be as much affected by socioeconomic status as is the traditionally more sensitive postneonatal death rate (Antonovsky and Bernstein, 1977; Thind et al., 1979). The implication of this situation is clear: Any policies and/or programs that are drawn up for the purpose of alleviating the adverse influence of a low socioeconomic status on infant mortality must look both at those correlates of a low status that directly impinge on the well-being of the new born infant (the quality of postnatal care, adequacy of diet, quality of housing, sanitary status of the home environment, etc.) and at those indirect influences that relate to the health of the mother and operate through her to influence pregnancy outcome (quality of prenatal care, age and parity, eating, drinking, and smoking habits, etc.) (Gortmaker, 1979).
(4) Definitionof Socioeconomic Status:There has recently emerged a growing awareness of the problems posed by the multidimensional nature of what is loosely referred to by the term "socioeconomic status" (Stockwell, 1966; Brooks, 19756; Adamchak, 1979). In particular, a number of recent studies have been concerned both with the fact that the nature of the relationship between infant mortality and socioeco-

nomic status will vary depending upon how the latter concept is operationalized, and with the fact that the nature of the relationship between infant mortality and specific socioeconomic indicators has apparently changed over time-- and is changing even now. More specifically, it has been hypothesized recently that what have been identified as "family-status variables" (e.g., the proportion of (a) female-headed families, (b) working mothers, or (c) disrupted marriages) may be as strongly related to infant mortality levels as the more traditional socioeconomic variables (Adamchak, 1979;Jones, 1980;Adamchak and Flint, 1981). The results of the present study lent only partial support to this hypothesis. Although only partial data have been included in this paper, an examination of several of these family status variables revealed that with one exception they were either very highly correlated with the more traditional economic variables, or they were not associated in any identifiable way with levels of infant mortality. The one exception, the percentage of married women with own children under six who were in the labor force, was not related to infant mortality in 1960 but did serve to differentiate infant mortality levels in 1970. While the influence of such variables does not appear to be as strong as that of more traditional economic measures, the fact that it has emerged at a time when the structure of the American family has undergone and is undergoing some fairly radical changes strongly points to the advisability of continuing to monitor this trend.
Over and above the fact that some variations do exist and that some changes may indeed be emerging it is eminently clear from the findings of the vast majority of studies that infant mor-

tality has consistently displayed a marked inverse relationship to the income dimension of socioeconomic status. From the pioneer effort by Woodbury (1925), through the 1950's and 1960's when the association appeared to be blurring, up to the present study, family income has been and continues to be a most potent determinant of the level of mortality in infancy.
CONCLUSIONS
One of the truly outstanding achievements of the twentieth century has been the remarkable progress that has been made in death control. This progress has been most keenly reflected in a profound reduction in the risk of dying during infancy, a reduction that is still taking place today. At the same time, however, it is abundantly clear that the fruits of this progress are not being shared equally by all segments of the population. The findings of the present research, as well as those of a wide variety of studies dealing with this general topic, have consistently shown that the lower socioeconomic groups in our society have been and continue to be characterized by an extremely pronounced disadvantage when it comes to infant survival. The clear implication of this observation is that, for whatever reason, existing maternal and infant health care knowledge and services are not reaching these lower socioeconomic groups.
Much of the credit for the progress we have made to date in reducing infant mortality can be attributed to the sometimes dramatic advances made in medical care knowledge and technology; but part of the credit must also be given to the federal government, particularly to those funded programs that have sought to enhance the quantity, quality, and ac-
