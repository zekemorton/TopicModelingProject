ABSTRACT: Macroanalytic studies of the relationship of fertility and development have been applied in the past based mostly on cross-sectional aggregate data from various countries. Because these countries belong to different models of the epidemiologic transition, variation in the dynamic relationship among these models should be allowed for. In this paper, various techniques (including linear and quadratic regression, a minimum-maximum method of plotting the relationship, a special approach of stepwise regression) were applied to a data set from 85 countries. The crude birth rate was used as the dependent variable with several demographic, economic, social health, and family planning indicators as independent variables, measures over the period 1950-75. The results confirm the existence of submodels of countries with varying relationships between fertility and its correlates. The results disallow direct transferability of the experience of one group of countries (such as Europe) to another group belonging to another model (such as the less developed countries). The study also found the strength of the family planning effort to be a significant factor and one to be singled out as a major contributor in the fertility decline between 1965-75 in the developing countries. Its effect, however, stands to be enhanced in various degrees by concurrent social and economic development.

In the growing debate about the relative role of development variables in fertility change, macroanalytic studies have been many. These studies are usually based on cross-sectional aggregate data for multiple countries to which various correlation, regression, and multivariate techniques are applied in an attempt to isolate fertility determinants. Little attention has been given in these analytic studies to the fact that the countries used may belong to different transition models in which the dynamics of fertility and mortality change may vary, and in which the dynamics may differ in the component models from the aggregate of these models. It is possible, therefore, that some of the dynamics of

fertility and mortality in the aggregate may be an artifact.
The models referred to in this study are those described by Omran (1971, 1977,1982) in his Epidemiologic Transition Theory. In that theory, several transition models were identified and characterized according to the pace and dynamics of mortality and fertility change in different societal settings. The Classical Model represents the health and demographic transition in Western societies over the last two centuries, that of a gradual decline in mortality, followed by a similar decline in fertility. A variant of this model was described for Japan and several eastern European countries where fertility decline was ac-

celerated by family planning and induced abortion; hence, the name Accelerated Model of the Epidemiologic Transition. The Delayed Model is seen in the less developed countries where the mortality transition was delayed until well into the twentieth century, while fertility maintains its high levels. The Transitional Variant of the Delayed Model is described for a number of less developed countries (LCD's) where fertility started to decline in the mid1960's, or thereafter.
In this report, we aim to examine the extent to which the interaction between development variables and fertility varies from one transition model to the other, to identify possible artifacts in the macroanalytic approach to corroborate (or refute) a development-fertility covariation, and to assess the relative role of family planning and socioeconomic factors in the recent fertility changes in the developing countries. Although this paper is limited to an examination of the macroanalytic approach to the relationship between development and fertility variables, the ascertainment that distinctive models of interactions exist has significant implications for policy formulation and strategy selection.

of international and national interest, there is no clear and agreed-upon definition of this concept. As in other studies, we are relying on a group of indicators approximating the concept. Initially, we _ collected data on some 54 indicators, a list eventually narrowed down to the 20 indicators given in Table 1. Care was taTcen to select indicators commonly used in other studies in order to allow comparability with those studies. To increase the accuracy of data, several sources were used for each variable. Temporally, a few gaps still exist, especially for the 1950's; nevertheless, the resulting data set allows not only crosssectional, but also time series analysis.
Throughout this paper, the dependent variable used is the crude birth rate. While we are fully aware of its limitations, especially its dependence on age structure, it is the one indicator that is readily available for a multitude of countries over the 25-year period. Fortunately, its correlation with other, more refined measures of fertility is satisfactorily high.
Various statistical techniques are used in this study to explore the following issues in terms of the models of the Epidemiologic Transition.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
In order to serve the objectives of this study, a data set was built in the Population Epidemiology Unit of the Carolina Population Center for macroanalysis containing national information on the annual demographic, health, social, and economic status of 85 countries for the period 1950-75. As might be expected, the choice of the variables was problematic. Despite the universal importance of socioeconomic development as a goal

RESULTS
THE NATURE OF THE FERTILITY-DEVELOPMENT RELATIONSHIP
First, simple regression analysis was used to examine the nature of the relationship between socioeconomicvariables and fertility (as measured by the crude birth rate). A simple regression

model was considered because it is a simple model and has been used in earlier studies. However,the simple regression approach was rejected after examination of the plots, and relevant statistics made it evident that for themajority of the variables the relationship was by no meanslinear.
A quadratic equation was then used

to represent the relationship of each socioeconomic variable and fertility. The results, given in Figures 1.1-1.8, reveal a curvilinear relationship with fertility. For three variables (GNP per capita, per cent GDP in industry, and newspaper

circulation per capita), the relationship is almost U-shaped. Thus, one level of fertility is correlated with two distinctly different levels of the so-called independent variables denoting different relationships in subsets of countries.

socioeconomic indicators differ from one indicator to another. In addition, it is clear that we cannot assume a linear relationship between fertility and these variables as previously stated.
These varying levels of fertility may

be better understood by considering the relative distribution of the observations for each variable involved in the analysis. For example, the relative distribution for variables Crude Birth Rate, Infant Mortality Rate, Per Cent Literate,

populations. That leads us to consider each one of these subpopulations in a separate analysis (as will be done later in the paper).

wide range of fertility levels as reflected by the maximum and minimum curves on each graph. The existence of such a wide range of fertility levels in relation to each socioeconomic variable weakens the likelihood of meaningful or stable threshold values asprerequisites for fertility change.

TRANSFERABILITY OFTHE RELATIONSHIP FROM O N E GROUP OF
COUNTRIES TO ANOTHER
Using the Epidemiologic Transition Theory (Omran, 1971, 1977,1982),we can divide our set of 85 countries into three groups (see Table2):

(a) the combined Classical and Accelerated Models (with slowly declining fertility),
(b) the Transitional Variant of the Delayed Model (with recently declining fertility), and
(c) the Delayed Model (with high fertility).
In this section, we will investigate the relationship between socioeconomic factors and fertility for each of these Epidemiologic Transition models, using the following example variables:
IMR Infant Mortality Rate % Literate Per Cent Literate of Those
Over 15Years of age %Agr Per Cent of Population Em-
ployed in Agriculture GNP Gross National Product Per
Capita (in U.S. Dollars) Fem.-L.F. Per Cent of Labor Force Fe-
male
A stepwise regression procedure was used to indicate the relative importance

of these five socioeconomic variables in explaining fertility for each Epidemiologic Transition model group of countries.1 Table 3 shows the results of stepwise regression for the period 19701975.
As an illustration, we will compare the results in the combined Classical and Accelerated Models with those in the Transitional Variant Model. For each step in the stepwise procedure, we indicate the number of variables appearing in both models simultaneously (Table 4). That is, for Step I, we have Per Cent Literate in the Classical/Accelerated Models and Per Cent in Agriculture in the Transitional Variant Model. Thus, the number of common variables here is 0. For Step II, we have GNP and Female in Labor Force for the Classical/ Accelerated countries and Per Cent in
1It is important to note that in considering each submodel alone, we may be dealing with an almost linear relationship.

Agriculture and Infant Mortality Rate for the Transitional Variant countries, and the number of variables in common here is also 0. Table 4 gives a summary of these results.
To make sense of these numbers, we note that if there is a full agreement between two submodels, then the sequence of number of common variables should be 1,2, 3,4, 5, corresponding to the five steps of the regression. On the other hand, if we do not have an agreement, than we may get a sequence such as 0,0,1,3,5. This idea was introduced by Salama and Quade (1982). To test for the similarity of two submodels, they suggest the test statistic
where T, is the number of common variables between the two submodels in the Ith step of the regression, and n is the number of independent variables in the model. They also provide a table for critical values for this procedure. Thus, to test for similarity between Classical/ Accelerated and Transitional Variant Models for the five example variables above, we have: Ti = 0, T2 = 0, T3 = 1, 74 = 3, T5 = 5, where n = 5.
That gives:
r - 0 + Q , 1 , 3 , 5 , 25
= 2.08, with/? = 0.1.
Similarly, Transitional versus Delayed models gives us a T = ^andp = 0.1.
To test for similarity between Classical/Accelerated and Delayed, we have 7 = ^ = 3.91 with p-value = 0.175. These results confirm our conjecture that these three models are different.

STABILITY OF THE RELATIONSHIP
OVER TIME
One of the points considered here is
the stability of the relationship between
fertility and the socioeconomic variables
over time. For this purpose, we selected
the Kendall rank order correlation coef-
ficient between CBR and the socioeco-
nomic variables for each submodel of
the Epidemiologic Transition. The
choice of Kendall correlation is based on
its descriptive nature which fits the pur-
pose of this analysis. Table 5 shows the
values of the correlation for the five 5-
year time periods, 1950-75, under con-
sideration, as well as the corresponding
p-values. Table 6 summarizes these rela-
tions and gives for each submodel the
maximum correlation, the minimum
correlation (and the same for the p-
values). It is evident from this table that:
1. For the developed countries (Classical/Accelerated Model), the maximum absolute correlation occurs at the fifth period (Fem.-L.F. at the fourth) and the minimum absolute correlation occurs at the middle period (Period 1 for Fem.L.F.). Also, the smallest p-value (i.e., most highly significant) occurred at the fifth period (Fem-L.F. at Period 3).
2. For the transitional countries, the maximum absolute correlation occurs in the fifth period (Fem-L.F. occurs in Period 1). The minimum absolute correlation occurred in Period 1 (Per Cent Literate occurred in Period 4 and Fem-L.F. occurred in Period 5). The smallest pvalue occurred in Period 5 (Fem-L.F. Period 1).
3. There is no clear pattern describing the correlations for the delayed Model countries except that, generally, the maximum absolute correlation occurred in Periods 4 and 5 for four variables, and Period 2 for all variables. The minimum /?-value occurred at Period 5 for three variables, and at Periods 3 and 4 for the other two variables.
Thus, regarding these comments and

the difference between the maximum and minimum correlation values, as well as the corresponding p-values, it is evident that the correlation values are changing over time. Two possible patterns can be identified for each of Classical/Accelerated and the Transitional models. The pattern in Classical/ Accelerated countries is almost quadratic with a minimum around the third

period, while for the Transitional it is almost linear increasing over time in absolute value.

bles occur?" The underlying hypothesis is that if fertility is dependent on development, the strongest correlation should occur in the Transitional Model where fertility has been actively declining since the mid-1960s'. To answer that question, we cannot consider the correlation values shown in Table 5 because of the changing sample size between the different models, as well as the possible change over time. However, we can use the p-value tables for this comparison where a small value reflects a significant relation. Table 7 gives the corresponding ranks for the p-values, within each time period, for each variable, and Table 8gives the strength of the correlation between fertility and socioeconomic indicators for different models (1 for the

smallest/7-value, i.e., the strongest). It
is evident that:
1. For Infant Mortality Rate, the strongest correlation occurred in the Developed and Transitional groups; the weakest occurred in the Delayed model.
2. For Gross National Product, the strongest correlation occurred in the Transitional model, followed by the Classical/Accelerated model; the weakest occurred in the Delayed model.
3. For Per Cent Literate and Female Labor Force, the strongest correlation occurred in the Classical/Accelerated model; the levels of correlation in the Transitional and Delayed groups are similar.
4. For Per Cent in Agriculture, the strongest correlation occurred in the Transitional group; the Classical/ Accelerated and Delayed models had almost similar patterns.

RELATIVE ROLE OF FAMILY PLANNING
VERSUS DEVELOPMENT IN THE RECENT
FERTILITY DECLINE IN L D C ' S .
In this section, we study the relative effect of the family planning program versus the socioeconomic factors in explaining fertility changes as revealed by the data. For this purpose, the transitional and underdeveloped groups were added together. The results are summarized in Table 9. The dependent variable is the difference between crude birth rates in the base period and the terminal period; the independent variables are the same five socioeconomic variables mentioned earlier for the base period. In the first column of Table 9, the base period is the third period and the terminal period is fourth. This means that there is afive-yearlag with Base Period 3. The second column represents Base Period 4 with lag of five years, and the third column represents Base Period 3 with a lag of ten years. A similar result was obtained when the dependent variable is the per cent change in Crude Birth Rate with respect to the base period.
It is clear from Table 9 that the strength of the family planning program is a significant and important factor to be singled out as a major contributor to fertility changes during the years 1965-75. For Terminal Period 5 and Base Periods

study that differ from those inthe litera-
ture include: (a) the consideration of
transition models; (b)the consideration
of stability of the interaction over time;
and (c) the use of new and/or modified
statistical techniques inthis analysis.
Five major issues have evolved from
our analysis:
1. Theflonlinearityofthe relationship between fertility and development indicators was demonstrated.
2. The analysis confirmed the existence ofsubmodels where the interaction of fertility and development indicators vary from one model totheother.
3. The temporal variation (i.e., lack of stability over time) ofthe relationships was also demonstrated.
4. Theexpected higher strength ofinteraction in the Transitional Model was not confirmed.
5. Our findings confirmed those reported by other studies (e.g., Mauldin and Berelson, 1978, and Tsui andBogue, 1978) inregard tothe explanation of recent fertility decline indeveloping countries. Our study confirmed that such a decline could be explained, statistically, more byfamily planning effort thanby national development. At thesame time,

it wasfound that the combined effect of both family planning anddevelopmentis larger than either one alone.
Finally, while the variation ofthe dynamic relationship between fertility and development indicators from one group of countries to another was proven statistically, this area is in need of further investigation, using larger data sets and using different statistical models.
Two major conclusions can be made in this regard:
1. It is risky to assume the transferability of the experience of one transition model ina group ofcountries to another. Hence, the historical experience of Western countries should notbe the basis for predicting thepopulation dynamics inthe developing countries.
2. From our data, it is clear that the strength of the family planning effort is a significant and important factor to be singled out asamajor contributor tofertility decline. Its effect, however, stands to be enhanced by concurrent social and economic development.
