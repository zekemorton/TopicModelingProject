ABSTRACT: In an earlier study of 46 pairs of male twins, genetic determination of certain social characteristics, speech, and vocabulary IQ was assessed at age 2.5 years. In a follow-up of 35 of these pairs at age 9, genetic and environmental factors were examined again in the same characteristics, as well as in antisocial and neurotic behavior, nonverbal ability, school achievements, height, and weight. At 9, significant genetic variance, replicated via two methods of calculation, was found in height, weight, nonverbal IQ, and antisocial behavior (teacher's rating). Shared family environmental influences were important for compliance, conscience, and antisocial behavior (parents' ratings). Social traits were thus less under genetic influence than were physical and cognitive characteristics, and for antisocial behavior, genetic and environmental factors were both important. Stable genetic determination across both ages was found only for speech, measured by speech rate at age 2 and speech maturity at age 9.

The genotype is by definition a lifelong property of the organism. If a genetic contribution to the phenotypic expression of a given trait can be shown only at one age, special mechanisms (e.g., the switching on and off of genes during development) may possibly explain the phenomenon (see below for a discussion). However, if a trait can be shown to have significant genetic variance repeatedly at different ages, the demonstration of at least partial genetic control becomes that much more convincing.
What is the evidence from existing longitudinal twin studies about the extent and the areas in which genetic determination has been found repeatedly at different ages? The major North American study that has followed the development of twins over age is the Louisville Twin Study that comprises about 300 twins whose mental test performance has been studied from 3

months to 15years of age (Wilson, 1978, 1983). Genetic variance in IQ scores increased, and between-family environmental influences decreased, in this sample between ages 1.5 and 8 years. Summarizing these findings from an epigenetic perspective, Wilson (1978) concludes that "the course of mental development is guided by the intrinsic scheduling of the genetic program acting in concert with maturational status and environmental influence" (p. 939).
Fischbein (1981) traced the physical and mental development of twins from 9 to 15 years of age in a sample initially of 323 pairs of twins. She found that in logical-inductive ability, differences between the zygosity groups stayed the same, implying a similar genetic component over age, whereas in verbal ability dizygotic twin partners became less similar. The author interprets these results as indicating that verbal ability is more under environmental than genetic in-

fluence. LaBuda et al. (1986) and DeFries et al. (1987) studied the genetic stability of cognitive ability from one year of age onward. They were able to identify substantial genetic stability from infancy to early childhood, and from early childhood to adulthood, as shown by significant genetic paths in path-analyses.

(1981) in tracing the development of temperamental characteristics in twins from infancy to age 6 confirmed that some of these twins display consistent genetic determination across this age span, but that environmental factors may be more important for aspects of temperament involved in the "difficult child" syndrome.

The development of temperament or personality characteristics in twins has also been studied longitudinally by a few researchers and a full review of such investigations has been provided by Goldsmith (1983). We will review these studies briefly. Goldsmith and Gottesman (1981) carried out a genetic analysis on about 300twin pairs from the Collaborative Perinatal Project. The twins were given ratings for temperamental qualities at 8 months, 4 years, and 7 years of age. The evidence for a genetic contribution for these qualities was uneven. Some aspects of temperament, e.g., activity level, showed genetic variance at one age, but not at another, many did not show it at all. In a reanalysis of a subsample of these subjects, Goldsmith and McArdle (cited in Goldsmith, 1983) found that the observed longitudinal stability of a factor descriptive of emotional reactivity was accounted for mainly by stable genetic factors.

Dworkin et al. (1976, 1977) carried out an investigation of the genetic determination of personality traits, assessed by the MMPI and the California Personality Inventory (CPI), at adolescence and at adulthood, as well as of the changes between those ages. The traits of anxiety, depression, and dominance showed significant genetic variance at both adolescence and childhood, while other traits exhibited it only at one age. Genetic variance was also significant for the profile contour of the CPI at adolescence and adulthood, and for the changes between these ages.
Clearly, consistent genetic determination over age has been demonstrated for cognitive ability and also for a few personality traits. In the latter case, firm conclusions are difficult, but it appears that heritability of personality traits is more consistent at adolescence and beyond than at younger ages (cf. Goldsmith, 1983).

Matheny (1980) has demonstrated some of the most consistent genetic variance over age in the Louisville twin sample. Behavioral variables were assessed repeatedly between 3 and 24 months and were reduced to factors by factor analysis. The factor "task orientation" showed the most stable genetic determination across age and the "profile of factors," i.e., the pattern of mean levels of scores across all factors, also had a consistent genetic component across all measurement occasions. Torgersen

A longitudinal investigation of the social and cognitive development of male twins, seen first at age 2.5 years and again when they were 8-10 years old, presented us with a welcome opportunity to reexamine the heritability of the traits studied at the earlier age and thus to address the question of stability of genetic determination. The aim of the investigation at age 2.5 years had been firstto relate the social characteristics of attachment, independence, compliance, and internalized standards, plus

speech facility and vocabulary, to parents' child-rearing practices, and second, to assess possible genetic determination of these characteristics (Lytton, 1980). At the time of follow-up, we were able to estimate again the genetic variance of those characteristics that had already been submitted to a genetic analysis when the twins were 2.5 years old. The genetic analysis was also extended to characteristics measured for the first time at age 9.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The sample of the original study consisted of 46 sets of male twins, 17 monozygotic (MZ) and 29 dizygotic (DZ). Mean age was 32.2 months, with a range of 25-35 months.
Twins were located through the birth registers of the local hospitals, and they represented almost the total male twin population born during 1969 and 1970in Calgary, Canada. The sample contained one-third middle class and two-thirds working class families (all white), as assessed by father's occupation (Blishen, 1967).
At follow-up at 8-10 years of age, we were able to locate 43 of the 46 original twin families. We received consent to obtain information from school records on 37 pairs, and 35 pairs (13 MZ and 22 DZ) participated fully in the investigation. The mean age of the twins was 9 years 6 months, and the range was 8 years 5 months to 10 years 8 months.
The methods of the investigation when the twins were 2.5 years old are described in detail in Lytton (1980). Observations of unstructured interactions between parents and children in the home, coded in detail, yielded summary behavior counts. Mothers were asked to write a "diary" account of all events in-

volving the child within a 24-hour period, and they were given a standard interview. The interview followed a structured interview format with possibilities for extra probes. It was concerned with parents' perceptions of their children's personality characteristics and with parents' attitudes and practices in relation to child-rearing. Based on the combined evidence of the observations, the "diary," and specified interview questions, we rated the children on the target characteristics and the mothers on their child-rearing practices and attitudes.
The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (Dunn, 1965) was administered to the children by a trained psychologist in an experimental playroom.
At age 9 the children were assessed at home and at school. The purpose of the home-based assessments was to obtain measures on the same social characteristics of the children that had been assessed at age 2 (see above), plus measures of twin and peer relations, and the children's social adjustment. In addition, present family roles and relationships were to be assessed. However, a structured family interaction session (FI) was substituted for the observation of unstructured parent-child interaction, because of the greater selfconsciousness of 9-year-old children in the presence of an observer.
An interview was given to mothers and fathers separately. This interview paralleled in content and form the interview which had been given to mothers at the time of the earlier study. The interviews were taped and later transcribed. The rater-interviewer rated a given trait on a 5-point scale, on the basis of the responses to all questions related to this trait. For a few traits the observations from the FI were also taken into ac-

count. Inter-rater reliabilities, established by having a second rater rate six protocols, had a median of 0.88, with only two falling below 0.70.
Child traits that were studied at age 2 (see above) were repeated and denned in an identical way, but interview questions were modified in accordance with changed age expectations. A question on quality of peer relations was added to the original set of questions.
Each parent also completed Rutter's Children's Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ), which is a screening test for psychological maladjustment, with parallel forms for parents and teachers. Its reliability and validity (Rutter et al., 1970) are satisfactory. Individual items are added up to form a total Maladjustment score, as well as a Neurotic subscore and an Antisocial subscore.
The second home visit was devoted to the observation of family interaction (FI) revolving round three structured tasks, which were designed to elicit family roles, relationships, and interactions. The tasks were: (1) a common construction with Lego, (2) "Pull for Pennies," a game adapted from the Madsen Cooperation Board (Madsen, 1967), and (3) a family discussion on topics set by the investigator, concerning the disposition of money earned in Pull for Pennies and typical disciplinary problems in the home. The session was videotaped and transcribed. Counts of certain interactive behaviors and ratings for cooperation in the Pull for Pennies task were converted to T-scores and combined to form the summary variables: Dominance, Organization of Task Activity, Cooperation, and Conflict. Thirty-four families participated in the FI. Reliabilities for the FI counts were calculated by having two researchers code two segments from the videotapes of each of six

families. The reliabilities ranged from 0.72 to 0.99, with a median of 0.85.
At school, classroom teachers were asked to complete a Child Rating Scale of 28 items. The scale was devised to measure the same child behaviors that were rated from the parent interview, but viewed from the perspective of the school. In addition, the scale included questions on the child's intellectual ability and school achievements. No interrater reliabilities could be obtained for this rating scale, since, in the majority of cases, the child had only one classroom teacher who was familiar enough with him to rate him on the characteristics of interest. Teachers were, however, given detailed instructions how to complete the scale to avoid a halo effect. Teachers also filled in the Child Behavior Questionnaire (Rutter, 1967), in the form designed for teachers, which differs only slightly from that for parents.
The children were tested individually by a trained tester. They were given the Chrichton Vocabulary Scale and the Raven's Colored Progressive Matrices to test their verbal and nonverbal abilities, respectively. Both tests are wellestablished and have good reliability and validity (Raven et al., 1977). In addition, the children were given the wellestablished Peabody Individual Achievement Test (PIAT) (Dunn and Markwardt, 1970).
Children's height and weight were measured by school nurses.
RESULTS
The 2-year variables were submitted to a biometric-genetic analysis (Lytton et al., 1977) and to the simpler, classical genetic analysis (cf. Haseman and Elston, 1970). Since the results turned out almost identical (cf. Lytton, 1980), we

decided to analyze the 9-year variables by the classical methods of the comparison of MZ and DZ within-pair variances, and the comparison of intra-class correlations.
In the 2-year study, only the rating for independence and the rate of child speech (number of utterances per minute) showed significant genetic components. The largest portion of the variance of the other characteristics was explained by between-families environmental effects. We attributed the meagerness of the genetic harvest to the relatively small sample, but it was perhaps also due to the fact that the measures were based on behavior which, at age 2, is notoriously fluctuating and volatile, though reliabilities between two scorers for ratings and experimental scores were quite satisfactory.
The results of the 9-year genetic analysis are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Our firstcriterion for the presence of a significant genetic contribution to the variance of a given trait is the rough test pro-

vided by the F ratio of MSwithinMz (Vandenberg, 1968). As a second criterion, we present the difference between the MZ and DZ intraclass correlations (Goldsmith, 1983). Where this is found to be significant also, we can more confidently accept the genetic component as "real." To meet the assumptions of the method, variables whose total variances for MZ and DZ twins differed significantly were excluded from consideration. This occurred only in the case of some social characteristics.

omitted because one or both correlations had a negative value: Guilt Index, Moral Reasoning, and Independence (teacher rating).
We will select for mention the characteristics that showed significant heritability either via two methods (see above) or via at least two raters (mother, father or teacher), since such repeated demonstration of a genetic component is an indication of a relatively reliable finding. The teacher rating of Compliance shows evidence of a genetic component via both methods of assessing significance, but the home-based ratings do not. The Maladjustment scores, assigned by mother, father, and teacher, display significant heritability across all three raters, and in the case of the teacher rating this is true via both methods. However, the evidence from the differences between MZ and DZ correlations for Compliance and Maladjustment teacher ratings must be suspect, since the MZ correlations are more than twice the DZ ones (see above). The most definite demonstration of genetic variance is evidenced by Antisocial behavior (a subscore of Maladjustment), as both mother and teacher ratings show a genetic component, and in the latter case thisfindingis confirmed by both criteria without qualification. The Neurotic subscore, on the other hand, shows no genetic variance. Other indications of heritability in the table are confined to one method of calculating it and to one rater and should therefore be treated with some caution.
Which characteristics show significant and equal correlations between twin partners for both MZ and DZ groups, suggesting between-family environmental influences? Compliance, rated from mother's interview, and Conscience, rated from both mother's

and father's interviews, do so. Maladjustment total and the Antisocial subscore, as rated by both mother and father, also manifest strong within-families environmental similarities. In the case of mothers' ratings there is also evidence of a significant genetic component for these characteristics, as assessed by the Fratio. The co-action of genetic and environmental forces in these characteristics provides confirmatory evidence for the assumption that both heredity and environment shape the phenotypic expression of these dispositions. That evidence for significant similarity of DZ twins and, therefore, of familial environmental forces, comes from mother and father (except for neurotic tendencies) must be seen in the light of the fact that parents are in the best position to see such similarity among their twins and are themselves chiefly responsible for creating environments for them.
GENETIC FACTORS IN CHANGES FROM
AGE 2 TO 9
For parallel variables, measured at both age 2 and age 9, we calculated "change scores" by subtracting the 2year z-scores from the 9-year z-scores and carried out a genetic analysis of these change scores. This was done for vocabulary-verbal IQ, for mother interview-based ratings of Attachment, Compliance, Conscience, and Independence, and for the teacher rating of Speech. The only variables whose growth demonstrated significant genetic variance (by one method only) were the Independence and Speech ratings (Table 3). Note that the Independence rating itself had a significant genetic component at age 2, and the Speech rating at age 9. Changes over age therefore were

not under greater genetic control than the characteristics measured at each age.
DISCUSSION
Fifty per cent of the physical and cognitive variables tested showed significant heritability by one or the other method and 22 per cent by both methods, but for the social characteristics the corresponding figures are only 36 per cent and 11 per cent respectively. The analysis thus demonstrates less genetic determination in social than in physical and cognitive aspects of the personality. This result is in line with findings from many previous investigations, which found only patchy evidence for genetic components in personality or temperament characteristics overall (e.g., Goldsmith and Gottesman, 1981; Jensen, 1967; Matheny, 1980; Portenier, 1939; Plomin and Rowe, 1979; Vandenberg, 1967). On the other hand, there has been repeated evidence for a genetic component in certain specific social traits, such as "sociability" and "extroversion-introversion" (cf. Buss and Plomin, 1975; Eaves and Eysenck, 1975; Loehlin, 1986;for a further discussion see Lytton, 1980, Chapter 9).

We have demonstrated significant genetic variance at age 9 in replicated form in the physical characteristics of height and weight, in nonverbal IQ (a cognitive variable), and in social maladjustment, particularly antisocial behavior. Mittler (1971) has reported that verbal ability may be more under environmental control and nonverbal ability more genetically determined. However, in view of the consistent genetic component that our investigation uncovered in speech competence, both at age 2 and at age 9 (though by one method only), it is surprising that the ability to acquire vocabulary and define words, assessed by both our verbal IQ tests, should not be influenced by genetic factors. The small sample size-- unavoidable, since this was a follow-up of an observational study--may be responsible for some instability in the results.
How much stable genetic variance could we detect in parallel measures at age 2 and age 9? The measures, we should emphasize, were parallel, not identical. Speech was the one characteristic that showed consistent heritability, but only if we are willing to equate the amount of speech at age 2 with the speech maturity rating at age 9. Inde-

pendence had significant heritability at age 2, but at age 9 the evidence for a genetic component, arising from the difference in correlations for father's rating, is fragile. For Compliance and for Attachment to mother significant genetic variance emerged only at age 9, but in each case the evidence must be treated with caution. Conscience and Vocabulary IQ consistently failed to show any genetic variance at either age.
The inconsistent findings of genetic variability from age 2 to age 9 may be due to the scales, e.g., for Independence and Compliance, measuring somewhat different functions at the two ages, particularly if assessed in different locales-- .school or home. However, the small size of the sample should warn us against accepting nil results too readily. Where we have solid grounds for expecting genetic variance, such as in height and weight, even the small sample displayed significant heritability. But where there is a lesser degree of genetic variance a small sample may not display it (cf. Martin et al., 1978). It may be that the conflicting phenomena of emerging and disappearing genetic components over age can be explained by other factors, e.g., a change from an expressive to a suppressive environment, or vice-versa (cf. Dworkin et al., 1976), or the switching on and off of genes during development (cf. Ho et al., 1980). However, such claims are difficult to substantiate empirically for ordinary human characters.
The correlations between twin partners for these social characteristics were generally higher at age 2 than at age 9, i.e., twin similarity was greater at the earlier age. At age 2 the components of variance analysis showed that for most of the social characteristics the largest part cf the variance was explained by differences between families of environ-

mental and cultural origin. This declined somewhat by age 9, i.e., the intraclass correlations tended to be lower (with some exceptions), particularly for MZ twins. This rinding suggests that differences between MZ twin partners widened over the years, perhaps because their experiences in their enlarged social environment diverged. However, low correlations are not only due to systematic within-families differences. Indeed, Loehlin and Nichols (1976) showed that when differences in parental treatments of the twins were quantified, such differences were not related to personality differences among twin partners. Low correlations will also be due to error and noise of measurement, and this source of variance will be inextricably confounded with systematic treatment differences within the family.
Heritability can be assessed by different methods, and results across methods, samples, and ages are often only patchily significant. Before accepting a genetic component as "real," one should therefore require a replicated demonstration of significant heritability, be it via several methods or for several ages or, best of all, across several samples.
We have shown significant genetic variance in replicated form at age 9 for a few characteristics. The robust evidence of genetic variance in children's behavior disorders is perhaps the most important finding of this study. It confirms evidence from other research which has shown genetic factors playing a role in adult antisocial behavior (cf. Rutter and Giller, 1983) and familial factors, which could be both environmental and genetic, in children's conduct disturbances (Stewart et al., 1980). In general, attempts to replicate genetic analyses over several samples have shown that the re-

liable demonstration of genetic determination for the normal range of most social characteristics remains more difficult than for cognitive ones.
In keeping with this limitation we were able to detect stable genetic determination from age 2 to age 9 only in the cognitive characteristic of speech facility, and even here genetic variance appeared in different operationalizations of this construct at the two ages. Overall, the evidence in the literature for stability of genetic determination of social personality characteristics is not strong. Only certain denned personality variables in some investigations (Dworkin et al., 1976,1977) seem to show consistent genetic determination over age, and this can be more clearly demonstrated from

adolescence on than from early childhood. This may be the essential reason why we discovered consistent heritability in only one cognitive characteristic.
