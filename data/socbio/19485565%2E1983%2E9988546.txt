ABSTRACT: This paper reports contraceptive use and eflBcacy rates among 648 married women aged 15 to 44 who had received genetic counseling six months previously. Over half (53.5 per cent) of the counseled population were using non-surgical contraception; 20 per cent were pregnant or postpartum; 10 per cent were seeking to become pregnant; 11 per cent were sterilized. Only 4.5 per cent were neither using contraceptives nor seeking to become pregnant. Women who were certain about their reproductive intentions after counseling utilized contraceptives effectively, with only two pregnancies at six months among those seeking to delay wanted pregnancies and only one pregnancy among those seeking to prevent pregnancy. This represents six-month contraceptive failure rates of 4.3 and 2.1 per cent respectively for the two groups, rates similar to those with comparable intentions in the U. S. population at large. A distinguishing characteristic of the genetically counseled group was that 32 per cent of contraceptive users reported that their reproductive intentions were uncertain after counseling. The six-month pregnancy rate in this uncertain group was 10 per cent.

A major objective of genetic counseling is to provide patients with medical and genetic information so they make informed reproductive decisions (Fraser, 1974). Actual pregnancy and birth rates in genetically counseled populations will reflect not only the medical and genetic knowledge of counseled patients, but in addition, the effectiveness with which counseled populations use contraceptives.
Elsewhere we have reported the change and stability in the reproductive intentions of women who receive genetic counseling (Sorenson et al., 1981) and have examined the relationships among the level of risk of having a child with a birth defect, the burden imposed by a birth defect, and the reproductive intentions of genetically counseled women (Sorenson et al., 1982, ms.). In this report we turn our attention to the use of contraceptives among a genetically counseled population six months following counseling.

Genetic counseling is a tertiary service provided by M.D. or PhD. specialists in clinical genetics. Clients may be referred to counseling by their physicians because they have already borne a child with a birth defect, have an affected relative, have suffered exposure to toxic agents, or are concerned about consanguinity or maternal age. The clients' greatest concern is usually whether they should have a(nother) child. Counseling may include a discussion of their riskof having an affected child, the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of the disorder, and occasionally social factors such as the cost of raising an affected child or its effects on the marriage. Most clients are seen by the counselor once.

the NSFG population was between 35 and 44. The genetically counseled group included far more women with more than a high-school education, 54 per cent as opposed to only 30 per cent in the NSFG survey. Only 13 per cent of the counseled group had less than a high-school education, as opposed to 25.3 per cent of the NSFG population. The genetically counseled group was not only younger and better-educated than the general population, but was also much more active reproductively. Immediately after counseling, as indicated in Table 1, over 20 per cent of the counseled group was either pregnant or postpartum, compared with only 6.8 per cent of the general population; over 10 per cent of the counseled group was seeking to become pregnant, as opposed to 6.5 per cent of the general population. Only 11.1 per cent of the counseled group or their husbands had been surgically sterilized, as opposed to 28.2 per cent of the general population. Clearly, those who go to genetic counseling include few who have completed their reproductive careers.

At six months post-counseling, 53.5 per cent of the genetically counseled group were using non-surgical methods of contraception, as opposed to 49.2 per cent of the U.S. population. Only 4.5 per cent of fertile women in the counseled group were neither using contraceptives nor actively seeking to become pregnant. This included 17 women (2.7 per cent) who reported that they did not believe in contraception.
The methods used by the counseled group are reported in Table 2. In general, they used these methods at rates similar to the national population, with slightly lower use rates for the most reliable methods (pill and IUD) and for the least reliable methods (rhythm and withdrawal). The choice of methods perhaps reflects the higher level of education among those counseled; women with more than a high-school education are less likely to use rhythm or withdrawal, and in recent years have also turned to methods other than the pill as they read of its potential adverse effects on health.

time that she either (1) intended to have no more children (a possible failure in quantity) ;or (2) intended to have a child but not within the two years following counseling (a failure in timing).
At six months post-counseling, the failure rate for the first group was 2.1 per cent (one reported pregnancy) and for the second group, 4.3 per cent (two reported pregnancies). For the U.S. population, failure rates (adjusted to a sixmonth basis) for those seeking to prevent an "unwanted" pregnancy were 2.5 per cent and for those seeking to delay a wanted pregnancy were 3.7 per cent. As the genetically counseled group included a far greater number of women with college and post-graduate educa-

tion than the NSFG survey, we would expect that their failure rates would be lower, as contraceptive efficacy increases among women with more than a high-school education (Vaughn et al., 1980). This was not the case. Among the "reproductively uncertain" group, there were 11 pregnancies. These cannot be considered contraceptive failures as they may have resulted from changes in reproductive uncertainty.
Table 6 reports the genetic and medical characteristics associated with the 14 pregnancies reported six months after counseling by immediate postcounseling contraceptors. It is not known how many of these pregnancies were carried to term.

Subsequent to genetic counseling, 92 per cent of the counseled women in this study intending to avoid an immediate pregnancy were contracepting. In general, they were employing the more reliable methods of contraception.
Among counseled women with definite reproductive intentions to delay or prevent pregnancy, contraceptive failure rates were low and roughly similar to rates among those with similar intentions in the general population. In view of the fact that 54 per cent of the counseled population had more than a

that contraceptive use is very effective among counseled women with definitive reproductive plans, but there may be a problem of effective use among women with uncertain reproductive intentions. Further research could clarify if such pregnancies are contraceptive failures, or the result of a change in pregnancy plans. In the meantime, counselors should be aware of the high percentage of clients who leave counseling uncertain of their reproductive intentions, and of the high pregnancy rate among this group.
