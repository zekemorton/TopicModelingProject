ABSTRACT: Data from the 1966-68 U.S. National Mortality Survey show more deaths during the birth month than in any other month for persons aged 35-84 at death. This effect is even greater for cardiovascular disease victims and shown to be statistically significant according to a log linear model. Another statistically significant effect is the interaction between marital status and month of death. The nonmarried group has a larger month effect than does the married group. These results point to an explanation of the birthday as a stressful event, which is demonstrated by an interaction between the month of death and whether or not the death was cardiovascular related. The status of being married however, seems to protect an individual from the birthday's negative effect. The variables of sex and living arrangements, according to the log linear model, do not have statistically significant interaction effects with month of death.

Phillips and Feldman (1973) see the birthday as one of many social ceremonies that can influence the timing of one's death. Their theoretical explanation of this phenomenon is derived from Durkheim's (1951) work on suicide, where Durkheim connected social integration with participation in social ceremonies. Durkheim hypothesized that an individual who is extremely isolated from society may react by committing suicide. Phillips and Feldman (1973) suggest that the reverse phenomenon may also exist: A person who is highly integrated into society may postpone death in order to participate in a social ceremony. They claim that famous people (selected as a highly integrated group) are more likely to exhibit a dip in deaths before their birthdays because of the great attention given to these events. Phillips and Feldman found a statistically significant dip in deaths in the month before the birth month and a statistically significant peak during the cal-

endar birth month and the subsequent three months. The size of the peaks and dips varied directly with fame, that is, the more famous the individuals in the groups, the larger the dip and peak.
Alderson (1975) extended the analysis to include demographic factors thought to be related to social integration. Using mortality data from England and Wales for 1972, he predicted that age, sex, and marital status were also associated with birthday effects. Younger age groups did not exhibit a statistically significant relationship between the birth month and death month, but for persons aged 75 and over, such a relation was found. This relation included "a deficiency of observed deaths in the months preceding the birth month, and an excess of deaths in the birth month and the following few months." The excess was greater for men than for women. When looking at marital status, the lowest excess of deaths was found among the widowed persons. Alderson

hypothesizes that one's birthday can bring stress, particularly to an older person, by reminding the person that he or she has less time on earth.
Schulz and Bazerman (1980) claim that the findings of both Alderson and Phillips and Feldman resulted from methodological flaws. Upon reanalysis, the data from each study did not support a dip in deaths before the birthday or a riseafter the birthday. Phillips and Feldman used calendar months as the time unit of analysis. When Schulz and Bazerman instead looked at deaths during the 31-day period before the birthday they found practically no dip. Likewise, there was no statistically significant rise in deaths during the 31-day period after the birthday. Subsequent 31-day periods did show larger than expected numbers of deaths, however, Phillips and Feldman's hypothesis implies that the death peak effects should be greatest immediately after the birthday. Schulz and Bazerman next demonstrate that Alderson's findings of a birthday effect for only those over age 75 were due primarily to the relatively high mortality at older ages. The number of persons at risk of dying at a given age is greatest immediately after the birthday and decreases until the next birthday, so it follows that more deaths should be expected right after the birthday and similarly fewer deaths before the birthday. This bias is most severe for older ages, which is why Schulz and Bazerman claim Alderson found a cyclical pattern of deaths only for persons over age 75 and no such pattern in younger populations.

persons; lower for married persons with children than for those without children and lower for non-married persons who are household heads than for those who are not heads." They explain their findings in terms of a social protection hypothesis, rather than a selection hypothesis, and believe that certain social statuses (like marriage and parenthood) give protection from mortality.
The other line of research relevant to this study concerns stress, mortality, and life events. Selye (1976) defines stress as "the nonspecific response of the body to any demand. Stress can be both helpful (eustress) and harmful (distress). For example, the dip in deaths the month before the birth month that Phillips and Feldman (1973) found can be due to eustress--"the will to live"-- while the peak in deaths during the birth month exemplifies possible distress. Life events, such as divorce or the birth of a child, have been shown to produce distress, although the relationship between undesirable life events and stress may not be as great as postulated by some (see Thoits 1981, for a review). Stress (or to be more precise, distress) has been clearly linked with mortality, particularly cardiovascular disease (Wolf and Goodell, 1968, provide a review). Reynolds (1974) has categorized life events which cause stress, and among these categories is certainty. There is nothing as certain as one's birthday. People can never be sure when they will die or how much money they will have to pay in taxes, but they do know that on a specific date every year they will be one year older.

Kobrin and Hendershot (1977) link social integration and mortality. They found that mortality rates are "lower for married persons than for non-married

undesirable event and therefore cause distress for some people. However, its impact depends on the significance society and the individual place on the occasion itself and on the process of aging, as well as the degree of social integration experienced by the individual. Unlike Phillips and Feldman, I will look at the ordinary population, not just the famous persons. I will extend Alderson's study to include cause of death and living arrangements of the decedent, as well as sex and marital status1. Persons under age 75 will also be included in the sample in order to overcome the methodological flaw Schulz and Bazerman discovered in Alderson's work.
The extent of the relation between the birth month and the death month should be associated with other variables known to be linked with stress and mortality. For example, cardiovascular deaths, since they have been shown to be related to stress should be more sensitive to the month effect than deaths due to other causes. Persons living alone may be more ill-affected (i.e., higher peak in deaths during the birth month) because they are not afforded as much social protection as those living with relatives or other people. Likewise, nonmarried persons should show a greater sensitivity to the month effect than do married persons. Finally, because gender is such an important determinant of mortality in general, the birthday effect for males may be different than the birthday effect for females.
1Preliminary analysis of month of death by age showed no clear pattern. Unlike Alderson's sample, the older persons in this sample (ages 65-74 and 75-84) were not more likely to die during the birth months than were younger persons in the sample.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data for this analysis were taken from the 1960-68 U.S. National Mortality Survey, a stratified sample of persons 35-84 years of age who died in 1966-68. Information concerning the decedent was obtained both from the death certificate and from a questionnaire sent to the death record informant named on the death certificate. Only cases coded "adequate" with respect to data quality, the highest ranking, were selected for analysis, resulting in a sample size of 15,949 out of 19,526 original cases.
Unfortunately this study cannot examine deaths 31 days before the birthday and 31 days after the birthday, as Schulz and Bazerman did in the reanalysis of the Phillips and Feldman data, because only the calendar month of birth was recorded in the survey. Deaths were recorded by both day and month, but again only the calendar month is used here. With this constraint, it is not possible to know if the decedent died before or after the birthday when the death occurs during the birth month. It would be more accurate to say then, that this paper analyzes a birth month effect rather than a birthday effect. It can be argued that the calendar month during which one's birthday falls has a special significance, even when the birthday comes at the very beginning or end of the month. Often times, we are asked the month and year of our birth, but not the day. Even though the month of birth may not be as important as the birthday itself, it still may hold some significance for an individual. Perhaps Phillips and Feldman actually discovered a birth month effect, since Schulz and Bazerman refuted the birthday hypothesis.
All of the data presented here show

ter. For example, someone who was born in January and died in December would be in the "one month before" category, as would someone born in June who died in May. Fortunately, the seasonal variation in mortality does not overlap with the slight seasonal variation in fertility to cause a deviation from the expected pattern of V12 of the deaths occurring in each month.

Those dying of cardiovascular disease exhibit a large dip in deaths the month before the birth month, unlike those dying of causes not cardiovascular related (Figure 1). During the birth month, the cardiovascular deaths contribute to a higher peak than do the deaths due to other causes.

These preliminary findings appear to support both a stress explanation as well as a social-protection explanation. The birthday seems to be a stressful occasion, as it affects cardiovascular deaths more than those of other causes. Certain subgroups of the population, however,

found that is not significant (p>0.05). In this case, a fit was not obtained until the fourth order model was tested (Model A). For this contingency table, there exists, therefore, at least one four-way interaction.
The next step is to eliminate those four-way interaction terms which do not improve the fit significantly. Terms were eliminated one at a time, dropping the term which lowered thep-value least, so long as the value remained above 0.05. Model B still has a good fit with (1234) included. No other model with one third-order interaction term fits well, for example, for Model C, with (1235), the p-value was only 0.0019. Because of space limitations, not every model tested is shown in Table 1. Under the same procedure, all three-way interaction terms not included in the term (1234) were found unnecessary.
The results thus far are encouraging. In no case is there a three-way or higher order interaction term involving the dependent variable (5). The two-way in-

dependent variable (month of death). The two-way interaction term (25) was found to be nonsignificant. Models D through K include various combinations of the two-way effects (15), (35), and (45) along with (1234). While it appears that the (15) term is necessary to include in the model, it is not entirely clear from Table 1 if either (35) or (45) or both are statistically significant.
Table 2 shows a more reliable way to test the individual two-way effects. Beginning with Model D, we examined the effect of deleting each two-way term. Model E is Model D without the (15) term. By subtracting the chi-square value of Model D from Model E, and similarly the degrees of freedom, we can determine the significance of the (15) term. Here, a probability value less than 0.05 indicates that the term being deleted is significant and should be included. When the terms (35) and (45) were deleted individually from Model D, they were found to be nonsignificant (probability values of 0.36 and 0.33, respectively). However, when they were deleted at the same time, the probability value dropped sharply (to p = 0.09), so further testing was done.
Model G includes the (15) and (35) effects along with the (1234) effect. Both two-way terms are significant to the mode], although the probability value for the (35) term (p =0.046) is close to 0.05. Model F includes the (15), (45), and (1234) effects, but not the (35) effect. Again the (15) effect is shown to be necessary to the model, but the (45) term can be dropped. The final conclusion to draw from this analysis is that the hierarchical model that best meets the criteria of good fit and parsimony is (1234/15/35). The resulting equation of this best fitting model is

(2)
In other words, there is a four-way interaction (as well as all lower order interactions) among Variables 1,2,3, and 4; a two-way interaction between Variables 1 and 5; and a two-way interaction between Variables 3 and 5. The twoway interaction terms also include the single variable effects of Variables 1, 3, and 5.
The four-way effect shown here means that cause of death, sex, marital status, and living arrangements are all interdependent, a finding which is neither surprising nor relevant to this study. The more interesting results are the interaction between cause of death and month of death (Variables 1 and 5) and the interaction between marital status and month of death (Variables 3 and 5). Of course, the one-way month effect is also significant, as it is included in both two-way terms.
The effect estimates, given by the u terms in Equation (2), show the relative likelihood of being in one category versus another (see Table 3). The main effect of the variable, month of death, shows that the birth month category has a higher expectancy than the category one month before it by a factor of exp(0.19-(0.04)), or 1.26. The risk of dying during the birth month is 26 per cent greater than the risk of dying the previous month. The next two panels of Table 3 show the interaction effects once the main effects are taken into ac-

count. The relative risk ofa nonmarried person dying during the birth month is greater than that ofamarried person by a factor of 1.17, above and beyondthe overallfindingofa greater risk ofdying during the birth month.
When looking at the effect estimates for the interaction ofcause and month, we see two interesting results. Firstof all, for those dying of cardiovascular disease, death is more likely during the birth month than the month before itby a factor of 1.15. Secondly, the effect of dying during the birth month is greater for the cardiovascular disease victims by a factor of1.08. Both of these effects are in addition tothe main birth month effect of marriage.
There is significant departure from random fluctuation in deaths among the twelve months, most noticeably, agreat

many more deaths during the birth month than in the other eleven months. Moreover, themonth effect is associated with both cause ofdeath and marital status, giving support to both the stress hypothesis and the socialprotection hypotheses. The birth month does indeed seem to have aneffect on the timing of death, particularly for those dying of cardiovascular-related causes. These individuals exhibit a dipin deaths the month before the birth month and a peak during the birth month. Additionally, married persons appear to have some protection from the distress during the birth month.
Another explanation forthe interaction between month ofdeath and marital status could be reporting error. There may be a tendency for the deathrecord informant to fill in the same

Vol. 32,No. 1-2

Special Occasions, Stressand Mortality

113

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

month for both birth and death if he or she was not sure of the decedent's exact birth month. If the decedent were married, the death record informant would probably be the spouse who should know the birth month. The death record informant of a nonmarried person, however, may not know this information. If reporting errors on the birth month were widespread, then perhaps the variable "living arrangements," rather than marital status would have been significantly associated with the month of death. Those persons living alone or with nonrelatives would be subject to a reporting error, perhaps even more so than the nonmarried. More importantly, cardiovascular disease victims should not have any greater reporting error bias than those who died of other causes. Report errors, then, can not provide a more credible explanation for either the interaction observed between marital status and month of death, or the interaction observed between cause and month of death.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
While some social ceremonies are observed by an entire society, such as presidential elections of Christmas, the birthday goes noticed by only the individual and those close to him or her. It is a time when a person is singled out and lauded (which is desirable), and simultaneously it is a reminder of advancing age (an undesirable effect). This analysis links the birth month effect with both stress and social integration, unlike the two other studies noted. Phillips and Feldman (1973) did examine the effect of varying degrees of social integration by assuming persons with higher degrees of fame were more socially inte-

grated, but it can also be argued that famous persons without close family ties may not be well integrated socially. The family and household provide individuals with the most immediate form of social integration, which Kobrin and Hendershot (1977) demonstrate can affect general mortality trends. It is therefore likely that family and household ties can buffer the distress during the birth month as well as protect individuals from mortality in general. Unlike Phillips and Feldman, Alderson (1975) did attempt to explain the birthday effect in terms of an immediate social support theory. However, as Schulz and Bazerman (1980) point out, his findings of a birthday effect for only the very elderly are due to a methodological flaw. Neither of the studies examined cause of death, which in this analysis, shows that stress (modified by the degree of social support) can be a major factor in explaining the strength of the birth month effect.
For this sample of ordinary persons, the birthday does not appear to postpone death to any great extent, except in the case of cardiovascular disease victims. The cardiovascular disease victims experienced a larger dip in deaths the month before the birth month, and a larger peak in deaths during the birth months, thus implying that the birth month is a stressful period, because cardiovascular disease is clearly linked with stress.
The status of being married, however, seems to protect an individual from stress during the birth month. A married person gains emotional support from his or her spouse, which can help make the birthday a pleasant celebration rather than a dreary reminder that one's years left on earth are dwindling.

Social Biology

A person's living arrangements do not appear to provide any additional protection during the birth month, once marital status is taken into account. Males and females do not exhibit any statistically significant differences in the timing of death.
Future research on this topic should first address the issue of possible reporting error bias. Data would have to be collected where the month of birth was asked independently of the month of death (i.e., while the decedent was still alive). Life insurance records mayprovide good data and so could a continuous population registration system, as in Sweden. It would also be preferable to use data where the days of both birth and death are recorded. Related areas

of inquiry, such as medical sociological research, could also be pertinent, where studies could be done to determine how a person's mental and physical health is affected by his or her birthday.
