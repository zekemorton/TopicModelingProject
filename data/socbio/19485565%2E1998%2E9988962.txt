ABSTRACT To elucidate the nature of the relationship between infant mortality in China and a variety of covariates using data from the 2/1000 Chinese Fertility Survey, we use a logistic regression model where the covariates are transformed with the help of Alternating Conditional Expectation (ACE) algorithm. This approach is used to overcome the general problem in multivariate regression analysis of coding the independent variables so that relationship between independent variables and response variables is best described, rather than coding such variables in an arbitrary way. The study demonstrates the procedures and usefulness of the ACE guided transformation in multivariate analysis. The transformed covariates are then used to estimate the effects of a series of socioeconomic and demographic factors collected in the study of infant death in China. The study shows that after appropriate transformations, all the demographic and socioeconomic variables selected have statistically significant and direct influence on infant death.

In recent years a great deal of attention has been focused on the mechanisms through which socioeconomic and demographic factors may operate to influence infant and child survival. For example, demographers are interested in whether family planning can significantly improve children's health by shifting births away from high risk maternal age, birth spacing, and parity groups (Bongaarts, 1987; Hobcraft, 1987; United Nations, 1994). The understanding of the determinants of underlying mechanisms requires innovative demographic research and methodological approaches.
A major development in the last several decades has been the development of multivariate models which incorporate the influence of a number of covariates simultaneously. One of the methodological problems with application of these approaches has been the inadequate consid-

eration of coding the explanatory variables in multivariate analysis. For example, mother's age at birth of child, an important determinant of infant mortality, is sometimes treated as a categorical variable (Trussell and Hammerslough, 1983; Hobcraft et al., 1985; Pebley and Stupp, 1987; Miller et al., 1992) and sometimes as a linear or quadratic interval variable (Pebley and Stupp, 1987; Retherford et al., 1989; Koenig et al., 1990), but justification was seldom given why a particular coding was chosen. Frequently, the choice of coding of such independent variables is done empirically or subjectively.
One of the consequences is that different studies may lead to apparently inconsistent conclusions. For example, Hobcraft et al. (1985) treated age of mother at birth of child as a categorical variable and cut it into four groups (10-19, 20-24,

25-34, and 35+) in their log-linear regression analysis of demographic determinants of early child mortality from 39 World Fertility Surveys and found that mortality is higher among children of teenage mothers but not higher among children born to mothers at older ages, even those with mothers ages 35 or over. In contrast, an earlier log-linear hazards model analysis of the covariates of infant and child mortality using the World Fertility Survey in Sri Lanka by Trussell and Hammerslough (1983) cut the maternal age into three groups (10-19, 20-34, and 35+) and found that death rates among children under 10 born to women less than 20 years of age were substantially (29 per cent) higher than for children born to women 20-34 years of age, as were death rates of children born to women aged 35 and over (21 per cent higher). When maternal age was treated as an interval variable, a U-shaped association of maternal age with child mortality was strongly supported in the hazards model analysis of child mortality in Guatemala by Pebley and Stupp (1987) and in Nepal by Retherford et al. (1989).
Although those inconsistent conclusions may be due to different datasets and methodologies, different ways of coding the variable of maternal age may be another important contributing factor which also makes comparison of the results across different studies difficult. This is also the case for the association of infant and child mortality with length of the previous birth interval. It is likely that mortality risks change smoothly with changes in such covariates, rather than exhibit sharp discontinuities, and models which permit this form of relationship should lead to more realistic and statistically efficient models as well as provid-

ing a better basis for policy evaluation and recommendations.
There are a number of methods available for the transformation of independent variables in regression analyses (Box and Cox, 1964; Guerro and Johnson, 1982; Hastie and Tibshirani, 1986; Kay and Little, 1987). However, lack of availability of computing software for those methods has limited their applications. We use the well-developed ACE (Alternating Conditional Expectation) algorithm (Breiman and Friedman, 1985; De Veaux, 1989) for variable transformations in this exploratory multivariate analysis of the impact of a number of demographic and socioeconomic variables on infant mortality in China. The paper shows how ACE is used to indicate the best transformation of the covariates included in the model so that the relationship between the independent variables and response variable can be best described in a logistic regression model.
Our study contributes to the understanding of the relationship between a variety of covariates and infant mortality in the following two important aspects. First, we use ACE algorithm to suggest a set of candidate codings for the explanatory variables and calculate the corresponding Bayes factors to select the best coding. This method overcomes the problem of subjectively coding the independent variables in multivariate analyses of infant mortality, and their relationship with infant survival is best described. Second, since our data on infant mortality are taken from a very large, nationally representative sample, our results are expected to provide more reliable estimates of covariates of infant mortality in China than previous research based on regional studies (Tu, 1989; Ren, 1995, 1996).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data for this analysis came from the China 1988 Fertility and Birth Control survey, often referred to as the "Two per Thousand Fertility Survey." It was conducted by China's State Family Planning commission from 1 July 1988 to 15 July 1988. The survey, representing a sample of two per 1,000 persons in mainland China, targeted ever-married resident women aged 15-57 years old. All provinces in the Chinese mainland took part in the survey. A single-stage nonproportional stratified cluster sample design was used to select 13,966 sampling points throughout the country. The sampling point was a small group with an average of 150 persons resident. The sample was stratified by province. The sampling fraction was 1.98 per 1,000 for the whole mainland population. However, within provinces various sample fractions were taken with the aim of obtaining representative data for each province. The average number of persons sampled per province was 72,000; altogether 2.15 million individuals were interviewed including half a million women aged 15-57 (Lavely, 1991). Therefore, it is larger and more complete than earlier surveys such as the In-Depth Fertility Surveys of 1985 and 1987 (Ren, 1995, 1996).
Along with the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, this survey collected detailed information on the retrospective birth histories, including information on survival of infants, of eligible women aged 15-57. For each child, information on the sex, parity, mother's age at the time of the birth, and socioeconomic characteristics of the parents was collected, enabling differentials by these variables to be estimated. Thus the survey permits in-

vestigation of infant death occurring as far back as 40 years before the survey, so that trends can be examined. However, the sample design means that older mothers are progressive removed from the sample, so that, for example, the oldest mother in the sample who gave birth 30 years before the survey was 27 years of age at that time. Moreover, the early sample results are subject to selectivity in that, for example, women with a large number of births in the early part of the study period must have had these births at a young age, and so they will not be representative of the whole group of women who had births of that order in that year. We account for such distortions by fitting a multivariate model with appropriate controls.
Another major problem in using data from retrospective studies is that they may suffer from recall errors on dates of birth and death of child, particularly for events which took place further back in time. However, the unusually high accuracy in reporting age-related life events in recent Chinese fertility surveys and censuses has been documented (Coale and Banister, 1994). In Chinese tradition and culture, age is reckoned in the lunar calendar system, in which each year is represented by the name of an animal with a specified characteristic in a 60-year cycle of 12 animals and five characteristics for each animal. Most parents, even if illiterate, know the exact day of their children according to this lunar calendar. In conducting the 1988 2/1,000 Survey, interviewers asked each eligible woman the birth date of each of her children either in the Chinese calendar or Western calendar. If the birth date was given in the Chinese calendar, the interviewer then translated this date into the Western calendar with the help of a Chinese-Western calendar translation table (Li, 1991). Thus

these data are not subject to the date shifting which is common in many surveys in developing countries.
The data set for this study is a 10 per cent of random sample of 2/1,000 Fertility Survey. We restrict our analysis to births after 1949, i.e., after the founding of the People's Republic of China. So we have a total of 118,346 births (61,286 boys and 57,060 girls), contributed by 35,652 women. Of these 118,346 births, 6,909 died before their first birthday, yielding the infant mortality rate as 58.4 per thousand. The infant mortality rates for the four birth cohorts of the 1950's, 1960's, 1970's and the period 1980-88 are calculated as 112.9, 70.7, 48.5, and 40.4 deaths per thousand live births respectively, which are comparable with the estimates by Tu (1989). This survey therefore has a size and quality which is greatly superior to most surveys available from developing countries.
To estimate the effects of sociodemographic variables on infant death, we use a logistic regression model with the binary response variable: death or survival within the first year (thus births in the 12 months before the survey are excluded, and the remaining 114,337 births are used for the logistic regression analysis). Selection of relevant independent variables is guided by previous studies on the determinants of infant mortality and constrained by those that were included in the survey. Therefore, we use the following variables: reproductive patterns--the age of mother at birth of child, and previous birth interval; socioeconomic variables-- urban-rural residence, mother's education and occupation, geographic region of residence, and ethnicity. Other control variables such as sex of child, month of birth of child, and breastfeeding in the first year

of life were also included. Table 1 lists all the variables included in the study together with their descriptive statistics.
These variables can be classified into two main types: (1) categorical (ordered or unordered) with multiple categories such as geographic region of residence or mother's educational attainment, and those which are binary variables such as residence (urban/rural) or ethnicity (Han majority/minority); (2) numerical variables, discrete, interval, or continuous, such as year of birth for a child or age of mother at the birth of a child. For binary variables, a simple indicator or dummy variable can be used to represent its effect in a regression model. For example, in our analysis sex of child is coded 1 if child is a girl and 0 if a boy. We also use a dummy variable to indicate whether the previous birth died before the birth of the index child. If the index child is a first child, the dummy variable is coded as "no," so this variable differentiates between those cases where the previous child died and all other cases (however, we later include parity zero as a dummy variable). Breastfeeding is also coded as a dummy variable indicating whether a child was breastfed within the first year of life. However, for the small number of children who died in the first month of life and who were not breastfed, we assume that their death was not associated with lack of breastfeeding (which would not necessarily be the case for deaths beyond one month). Therefore we code the breastfeeding variable in the first month as "yes" for all children who died in the first month, and this procedure will produce a small conservative bias in estimated effect of breastfeeding on child survival. For coding non-binomial categorical and numeric variables, we use the ACE algorithm described in the next section.

ACE GUIDED TRANSFORMATION
OF COVARIATES
In logistic regression analysis, the objective of fully exploring and explaining the effect of covariates on the log-odds of event occurrence is facilitated by properly coding the independent variables. For a categorical variable, a conventional way is to create a set of dummy variables, but this is often done on an ad hoc basis. It is possible to collapse some neighboring groups of the categorical variable, but we don't know how to find the most efficient cutting points. In terms of a numeric variable, we usually have no prior knowledge or consensus on whether it should be entered in the logistic model in a simple linear form or in a transformed one, which could be a straightforward polynomial form, such as linear and squared terms, or a non-linear function which cannot be estimated directly. Sometimes we cut an interval variable into several groups and treat it as a categorical variable, and if so, we again have the problem with identifying the most relevant class limits so that the newlycreated categorical variable can best represent the original interval variable.
Here we search for efficient transformations using the ACE (Alternating Conditional Expectation) algorithm (Breiman and Friedman, 1985; De Veaux, 1989), a technique originally developed for finding nonparametric transformations of both the independent and dependent variables in multiple linear regression such that the relationship between them is as linear as possible, an approach which can also be extended to generalized linear models (Raftery and Richardson, 1996). The ACE results can be used to indicate if transformations are necessary and, if so, to suggest empirically

meaningful parametric or nonparametric transformations for use in logistic regression. However, we do not actually use the nonparametric transformations estimated by ACE in their raw form but find functional approximations to them which we then estimate.
This approach is implemented using the ace and avas functions in the S-PLUS statistical package for multiple linear regression (Venables and Ripley, 1994) and the ace.logit*function for logistic regression (Raftery and Richardson, 1996). To apply the ACE algorithm to possibly recode an independent variable, an examination of the scatterplot of the original values against the ACE transformed values may give insight into the nature of an approximately optimal transformation. For example, if the plot is judged linear, a linear model with the original data is appropriate; if not, it suggests an idea of what kind of transformation should be employed. Possibilities include power and log transformations, threshold and piecewise linear functions, categorical (i.e., piecewise constant) transformations, and quadratic or higher order polynomial terms. If the suggested transformations have the form of a threshold effect, where the nature of the relationship between the response variable and covariate changes beyond a particular point threshold value, we may then consider recoding the variable into piecewise linear or sometime categorical variables. It is often possible that there are a number of potential candidates for transformation of a variable. To select the best transformation, we use the BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion)

because most models considered here are non-nested and this statistic has been demonstrated to be a good index for comparing non-nested models (Raftery, 1995). The BIC statistic, originally derived from a Bayesian approach to statistical inference, can be expressed as:
BIC =-X2 + p\ogN
where X2 is the likelihood ratio test statistic for comparing the null model without covariates with model of interest, p is the number of independent variables in the model of interest, and N is the sample size, which in our case is the number of cases in the logistic regression. The smaller BIC is, the better the model. However, to test the differences between nested models, we use the conventional likelihood ratio statistic.
CODING THE TIME PERIOD VARIABLE
To illustrate the use of the ACE algorithm, we first apply it to recode the year of birth of child (i.e., time period). We show in the next step how ACE is used to guide the transformation of period and how BIC is used to select its best transformation. The same procedure is extended to recode other independent variables.
We undertake the transformation of time period in two steps. First we use the ACE algorithm to get a transformed function of period and plot this against the original period. The result is shown in Figure 1. Secondly, based on this estimated pattern, we then try different transformations of period and select the best one according to BIC.
The ACE result in Figure 1 suggests a transformation with a threshold at a certain year c, where c appears to be around 1970. It also suggests at least five possi-

ble transformations for period: (1) a piecewise linear spline with a node at c; (2) a linear variable before c and a constant value (dummy variable) after c; (3) a simple straight line over the whole period; (4) a quadratic curve; (5) an exponential function. The BIC statistics corresponding to five types of transformations are presented in Table 2.
Table 2 shows that all the specifications proposed are statistically significant according to chi-square statistics. However, we cannot judge the relative goodness-of-fit of those transformations using these chi-square statistics because the models are non-nested. For this purpose, we resort to the use of BIC statistics. According to BIC, the spline functions fit better than others, with the simple linear variable for period effects having the worst fit. Of three spline functions, the spline with a node at year 1971 has the lowest BIC score, so it is the best specification of the time period effect of child's dying in the first year. This coding can be expressed as:
year 1 = year-1950 for birth year < 1971 and27 (i.e., 1971-1950) otherwise
year 2 = 0 for birth year < 1971 and year-1971 otherwise.
Although the statistics presented in Table 2 demonstrate the relative goodness of fit among the models, they do not provide information about the absolute fit of the models. To compare the goodness-offit of the untransformed period (i.e., linear) model with that of the best coding (i.e., linear-spline model), Figure 2 is given to show the estimated log odds of infant mortalities from 1950-1987 (dots) and their approximate 95 per cent confidence intervals, the linear fit, and the linear-spline fit.

It shows that the spline curve as suggested by the ACE plot and BIC statistics fits the period effects very well, lying within or very close to all the confidence intervals, whereas the simple linear fit lies outside the confidence intervals at several time points. The result suggests the statistical efficiency of the ACE guided transformations.2
2Thefigureindicates that there was elevated mortality in the period 1958-1961 associated with the Great Leap Forward, but our main interest is in long-term trends and their specification.

CODING OTHER COVARIATES
We now turn to coding other variables using the ACE algorithm. So far, we have considered the ACE guided transformation just for one independent variable, namely year of birth of child, but the approach for more than one predictor variable is a simple extension of the bivariate case, allowing a matrix of independent variables to be transformed. The following analysis is based on transformation of six independent variables simultaneously plus

time period. The plots of the transformed variables against the original ones are shown in Figure 3 for the variables; maternal age, length of previous birth interval, mother's educational achievement, mother's occupation, geographic residence of child, and month of child's birth. Using analyses similar to those used for coding the period variable, the following choices were made.
Maternal age.--The relationship between the original and transformed age roughly exhibits a "U" shape in Figure 3. However, the transformed value for age less than or equal to 15 is extremely high, suggesting a possible dummy variable for age · 15. The curve is rather flat about between age 20 to 39. So the following possible transformations are proposed: (1) a quadratic curve for the entire age span; (2) a dummy for age · 15 and a quadratic function for age Hl5; (3) three splines: linear for age H20, constant (dummy variable) for age 20 to 39, and linear for age H39. After calculating the BIC statistics for these three suggested models, the first specification had the lowest BIC score, so we estimate maternal age plus age squared as the best specification of the relationship

between maternal age and her child's death in the first year of life. The best parametric transformation of age effect can also be determined by using a Box-Cox method (Box and Cox, 1964; De Veaux, 1989). As an exploratory analysis, this study did not perform such analysis here.
Birth Interval.--The plot of the transformation of previous birth interval clearly suggests that a dummy variable is needed to represent the first birth, which does not have a birth interval associated with it. For other parities, it confirms that the risk decreases smoothly with duration and suggests a possible logarithmic transformation for birth intervals. (In fact, we use the length of the birth interval minus eight months to allow for the period of gestation in our models and charts. We do not separate out multiple births, and the birth interval in such cases is taken as that since the last maternity.) BIC statistics show that a dummy variable for the first birth and algorithmic dependence on the previous birth interval for the rest can best describe the effect of this variable on infant mortality.
Educational attainment is measured as the reported highest level of educational

that combination of Regions 1 and 3 as well as Regions 2 and 4 are satisfactory codings for representing the differentials in the logodds by region of residence.
Season (month of birth) is coded with twelve integers from 1 to 12, representing from January to December. The ACE plot suggests dividing the whole year into two broad seasons: (1), 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 (i.e., Spring and Summer) and (2) 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 1 (i.e., Autumn and Winter), and this coding, according to the BIC criterion, accounts for most of the variability.
RESULTS
Table 3 presents a series of six logistic regression models of infant mortality with increasing numbers of covariates which have been identified as likely to be associated with infant mortality (Mosley, 1984). Model 0 is presented for completeness, since these time trends reflect not only changes in infant mortality, but also the sample design which truncates the experience of older women in the early years; Model 1 includes a control for age and therefore represents the "simple" gross time period effect; Model 2 presents estimates of demographic determinants of infant death; Model 3 contains estimates for the socioeconomic variables; Model 4 includes estimates for demographic and socioeconomic variables; and finally Model 5 presents the full model. These models are organized so as to address a number of important questions by comparison of different models.
First, a comparison of Model 1 with other models can inform us of the extent to which the infant mortality decline between 1950 and 1988 can be explained by the changes in reproductive patterns, socioeconomic developments, and other

variables. The coefficients for the two linear variables representing the year of child's birth in Table 3 approximately reflect annual relative changes in the log odds of infant mortality for periods 1950-1971 and 1972-1988. Model 1 shows a substantial decline (about 5 per cent annually) in the log odds during 1950-1971 but the pace of decline slowed down (to about 2 per cent annually) during 1972-1988. After adding the full set of independent variables to Model 1, the two slopes of the period variables in Model 5, as in all the intermediate models, remain almost unchanged and still statistically significant, suggesting that the decline in the infant mortality between 1950 and 1988 cannot be explained by changes in these sociodemographic variables included in this study. Indeed, the time period effect is slightly stronger in Model 5 than in Model 1. Thus, there are other factors which played an important role in the mortality decline. There is no doubt that the Chinese government made great progress in the reduction of infant mortality soon after the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949. Cessation of warfare, maintenance of public order, redistribution of agricultural land, movement of grain to deficit areas, and massive concentration on preventive public health measures were examples of political and macro-socioeconomic factors which contributed to mortality decline (Banister, 1987). As Banister (1987) pointed out, there are a number of specific reasons for such a spectacular drop in infant mortality during the 1950's. Training midwives probably had a substantial impact in reducing neonatal tetanus and other infections linked with non-sterile childbirth conditions. Relatively stable

nutritional conditions for mothers probably helped them in breastfeeding their babies. The emphasis on environmental sanitation and control of pests starting in 1952 also reduced the incidence of fatal diseases among infants. Epidemic-control measures might be another factor in lowering infant mortality.
Second, comparison of Models 2 and 4 provides a means to assess the extent to which the impact of demographic variables are altered by the socioeconomic determinants of infant mortality. The results show that the coefficients of the demographic covariates do not change very much after introducing the socioeconomic variables, indicating that demographic determinants operate directly on infant mortality.
Third, the full model shows the direct net effects of the full set of sociodemographic covariates. Model 5 suggests that all the variables included in the analysis have statistically significant impact on infant mortality. Most of the following discussion will be based on this model.
DEMOGRAPHIC DETERMINANTS
All the reproductive variables included are strongly related to the risk of infant death, and their coefficients are in the expected direction and statistically significant. Many previous studies have a Ushaped relationship between mother's age at the birth of child and infant mortality (Pebley and Stupp, 1987; Retherford et al., 1989; Koenig et al., 1990). This finding is strongly confirmed by the results from this study. The significance and signs of the two maternal age coefficients indicate that the highest risk of mortality during the first year of their lives is found for the children of mothers at youngest and oldest ages. Parity, which is another important reproductive variable but high-

ly correlated with mother's age, is omitted in the model.
A consistent finding in the literature is that longer birth interval improves the child's survival chance (Gray, 1981; Trussell and Hammerslough, 1983; Hobcraft et al., 1985; Pebley and Stupp, 1987; Retherford et al., 1989; Das Gupta, 1990; Koenig et al., 1990; Miller et al., 1992). There are four main explanations for why shorter birth interval may be associated with increased risk of infant death: (1) a short birth interval depletes the ability of the mother's body to recuperate, thereby possibly affecting the succeeding infant's health (Palloni and Millman, 1986); (2) a short preceding interval may be indicative of a premature birth, rather than reflecting a causal relationship (although the presence of a young infant may exacerbate the problems in coping with a premature baby); (3) a closely following birth may lead to competition for resources among siblings; and, (4) increased likelihood of transmission of infectious diseases between sibs close in age.
The estimates and significance of the two birth interval variables in Model 2 remain unchanged after introducing other controlling variables in Model 5, suggesting that previous birth interval is a factor with the strongest and direct effect on infant mortality in China over this period. First births have a lower infant mortality rate than second or higher parity births. The odds of dying in the first year for the first child is 22 per cent lower than the value for a subsequent birth occurring at the median birth interval of 23 months since the previous birth (i.e., exp(--2.055)/ exp{-0.667*ln(23-8)}=0.78). This finding is consistent with the result from Tu's study of the covariates of child mortality in Shaanxi and Shanghai of China (Tu,

Vol. 45, No. 1-2

Infant Mortality

1989). A possible reason for this finding is that the first child has the advantage of having no previous sibling to compete with for parents' attention and resources. Cultural factors may also contribute to the lower mortality of first births in China (Tu, 1989). In China, the birth of the first child is a very important event for a family, and the first child usually enjoys much more attention and care than others. Also, Chinese grandmothers generally play a very important role in taking care of their grandchildren, especially in rural areas. Their involvement, advice, and supervision can overcome some of the disadvantages that first births encounter because of physiological difficulties in delivery and their mother's lack of previous childbearing and care experience (Tu, 1989).
To interpret the effect of the preceding birth interval, we select three birth intervals: 20, 30, and 40 months and calculate the corresponding odds relative to that for a 10-month interval; the values are 0.303, 0.202, and 0.157, respectively. There are much larger differences between the odds for a 10-month birth interval and the rest than the differences between intervals longer than 20 months. This finding indicates that birth intervals less than 20 months are associated with relatively high risk of infant death, and this would appear to be an appropriate point at which to form a boundary in categorical analysis.
The survivorship of the preceding child is consistently reported to have an important role to play in survival of index child. First, survivorship of the preceding child may affect postpartum amenorrhea and therefore have an influence on the preceding birth interval (Pebley and Stupp, 1987); Retherford et al., 1989; Das Gupta, 1990). Thus, controlling for survivorship of preceding child can also reduce bias to the esti-

mated effect of previous birth interval. Second, there may be a family clustering effect on infant mortality due to a variety of biological and social factors such as a tendency for some mothers to experience repeated complications of pregnancy or premature births, or a tendency to repeat unhealthy childbirth practices such as unhygienic care of the umbilical cord (Pebley and Stupp, 1987; Das Gupta, 1990). So survivorship of the preceding child serves as a partial control for previous child mortality within the family. The results show that there is strong evidence of familial association in infant mortality in China. The odds of dying in the first year is 54 per cent higher for a child whose preceding sibling died before his/her birth compared to children with the same values of the other covariates, but whose preceding sibling survived.
SOCIOECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS
Comparison of Models 3, 4, and 5 shows that the socioeconomic variables selected in this study have a statistically significant and direct impact on infant survival after controlling for demographic and other variables. Living in an urban setting is assumed to have a positive impact on child health through a variety of factors, such as better access to medical services, even after controlling for factors such as the generally superior educational and occupational composition of urban populations. This is indeed true in China where cities are usually equipped with advanced medical facilities and have a good public health system. It is no surprise that the children in rural areas have a significantly higher chance of dying in the first year of their lives than their urban counterparts with otherwise similar characteristics. Education has always been a key variable in the demographic studies

of infant mortality (Trussell and Hammerslough, 1983; Hobcraft et al, 1985; Miller et al., 1992). Education is assumed to affect infant health in several ways (Retherford et al., 1989). Well-educated women probably have easier access to information on nutrition and health care. Education may also help in implementing medical advice. As such, education enhances the efficiency of the process of producing surviving children. The coefficients in Table 3 show a relationship between lower log odds of dying during infancy and higher educational level of the mother, even when the effects of other variables, including occupation, are held constant. The children of mothers without any schooling or with little schooling have 1.42 times the odds of dying during infancy as those with mothers of senior or above education. However, this differential is not substantial when compared with that of many other covariates, for example, with the magnitude of time changes in the early period discussed earlier.
Women's occupation is also found to be an important determinant of infant mortality. Children of mothers working in industry, service, and professional areas have significant lower infant mortality than the children of mothers working in other sectors, principally in agriculture. In terms of ethnicity, compared with the Han majority, which accounts for over 93 per cent of the total population, children of national minorities have a higher risk of infant death. Although individual-level socioeconomic variables have been controlled for, this result is probably related to the fact that these national minorities tend to live in remote, underdeveloped frontier areas where medical facilities are inferior.
There are also regional differentials in infant mortality. Compared with the three

municipal cities (Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai) and the Northeast region, the other regions have higher infant mortality, particularly the economically backward Southwest region, which includes Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan, which has the highest odds of infant death, more than twice the value of the most favored region.
OTHER CONTROLLING VARIABLES
The season (month in which a child was born) also has an effect on infant mortality. Model 5 in Table 3 shows that children born in Spring and Summer have lower odds of death in the first year of life than children born in Autumn and Winter, suggesting that infants born during the Autumn and Winter are exposed to some seasonally related diseases, although we have no additional information on this aspect.
There have been inconsistent reports on sex differentials in infant mortality in developing countries. Some studies showed that girls suffer excess mortality in societies like India (Das Gupta, 1990), whereas others reported the reverse (Miller et al., 1992). This latter result is also true in China and consistent with the results from Ren's study (1995, 1996) in three provinces of China. Whether a child is breastfed or not is also a very important determinant of child survival. A child, if breastfed after birth, has much lower infant mortality than one without any breastfeeding. This finding is in conformity with most other studies (Retherford et al., 1989; Das Gupta, 1990; Miller etal., 1992; Ren, 1995,1996).
SUMMARY
This study analyzes the socioeconomic and demographic determinants of infant mortality in China using the data

Vol. 45, No. 1-2

from the 2/1,000 Chinese Fertility Survey. We employed logistic regression to examine the trends and differentials in infant mortality between 1950-1988. To better describe the relationship between risk of infant death and its determinants, we used ACE algorithm for the transformation of independent variables. In conventional multivariate analyses of the determinants of infant mortality using event history and logistic regression methods, coding of independent variables has often been done in a subjective way. Sometimes we have difficulty with deciding whether a covariate should be treated as categorical or interval; and if categorical, what relevant class limits should be used for cutting. This study has demonstrated the procedures and usefulness of ACE algorithm for helping us in understanding the relationship between independent variables and infant mortality by guiding us in choosing transformations in logistic regression model analysis of infant mortality in China. We hope this analytical tool will provide new encouragement for the empirical modeling of social phenomena.
During the past several decades, China has experienced a dramatic decline in infant mortality. We have attempted in this study to decompose the declining trend in infant mortality into parts that are attributable to changes in biologic factors, socioeconomic conditions, and other. We find that the decline in infant mortality between 1950 and 1988 cannot be explained by changes in these variables included in the study. Thus, the unobserved social changes that have occurred in China over time have played an important role in improving infant survival. Those social changes may be due to the influences accompanying the socioeconomic develop-

ment and to the government intervention policies in modernizing the country (Banister, 1987; Ren, 1996).
This study shows that after appropriate transformations, all the demographic variables selected have statistically significant and direct influence on infant death. We find that longer birth intervals tend to lower the risk of child death. We also find a significant effect of mother's age on the risk of mortality after controlling for other covariates. Our findings yield some support for the notion that family planning programs may contribute to reducing infant mortality through increased mother's age and birth spacing (United Nations, 1994).
The study also finds that infant mortality in China is strongly related to the mother's socioeconomic characteristics. Children of mothers living in rural areas, with less education, engaging in agriculture work, and being members of national minorities, have higher risk of dying during their first year of their life. There is much to be done for the Chinese government to reduce infant mortality. Promoting education of couples may reduce infant mortality. Improvements in medical services in rural areas and for minority-populated areas would certainly further reduce the overall level of infant mortality.
