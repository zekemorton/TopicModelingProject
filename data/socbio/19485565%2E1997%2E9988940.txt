ABSTRACT: The effects of sociodemographic variables on mortality for U.S. adults are estimated, using data from the National Health Interview Survey matched with National Death Index data. Dependent variables of the proportional hazards models include all-cause mortality and mortality due to circulatory disease, lung cancer, breast cancer, other cancer, other medical causes, and nonmedical causes. Results indicate that all of the sociodemographic variables (education, income, employment status, marital status, race) have independent effects on all-cause mortality, with similar-effect sizes for males and females, and weaker effects in the older group (ages 65+) than the younger (ages 25-64). For the separate causes of death, the effects of most sociodemographic variables vary by sex.

Demographic and economic differentials in mortality in the United States have been documented by numerous studies throughout the century, with Kitagawa and Hauser's (1973) analysis of matched census/death record data being one of the benchmark studies. That study reported education and income differentials on allcause mortality (ACM) and education differentials on separate causes of death as of 1960. Subsequent multivariate studies of U.S. population data during the past twenty years have shown that education, income, employment status, marital status, and race/ethnicity sometimes have independent effects on the risk of ACM (Bucher and Ragland, 1995; Mott and Haurin, 1985; Otten et al., 1990; Rogers, 1995; Smith and Waitzman, 1994; Sorlie et al., 1995). A few studies have looked at the extent to which the effects of sociodemographic variables (education, most often) on ACM or heart disease mortality vary by age-sex subgroups. Most find a weaker effect of sociodemographic vari-

ables in the elderly population compared with the younger population, although results have been inconsistent (Jefferys, 1996). Some studies have reported sex differences in the effects of education, depending on the time period studied (Christenson and Johnson, 1995; Feldman et al., 1989; Kitagawa and Hauser, 1973).
Less is known, even on a descriptive level, about the effects of various sociodemographic variables on separate causes of death and the degree to which these effects vary by age-sex subgroup. The effects of sociodemographic variables may be large for some causes of death and nonexistent for others, and the observed patterns of effects can shed light on the linkages between sociodemographic variables and ACM.
The present study uses a relatively new national data set to estimate the independent effects of socioeconomic and demographic variables on a few major causes of death and the extent to which these effects vary by age-sex group. The sociodemo-

graphic independent variables include education, income, employment status, marital status, and race. The dependent variables are the hazard rates of death from six broad causes.
Education, the main sociodemographic variable in Kitagawa and Hauser's (1973) benchmark study, reflects several economic and noneconomic factors, some of which include income potential, working conditions, social-psychological resources, knowledge of risk factors and the health care system, and health behaviors (Ross and Wu, 1995). Past research has been inconsistent about the effect of education on mortality and how the effect varies by sex. While education is the preferred measure of socioeconomic status (SES) in this data set, I also look at income and employment status (working vs. not working) as determinants or correlates of mortality. Like education, income and employment status have shown significant effects on a variety of health conditions as well as on mortality in past studies. The effects of these SES variables are compared across the different causes of death, and across agesex groups.
Whether or not SES has "generalized" effects, influencing diverse causes of death through multiple proximate determinants, has been difficult to resolve (Marmot et al., 1984; Preston and Taubman, 1994) and cannot be addressed in this study. SES, however, can be considered a "fundamental cause" reflecting access to key social resources, which can establish a long-term link between SES and mortality despite changing proximate determinants (Link and Phelan, 1995; Williams and Collins, 1995).
The risk of mortality is generally lower for married people than for unmarried, perhaps due to better health habits, greater

social support, and sometimes higher income. Selection may also be part of the explanation, if persons already in poor health are less likely to get married or are more likely to get divorced. Most research indicates a larger beneficial effect of marriage for males than for females on allcause mortality (Rogers, 1995) and a smaller effect for older people than for younger (Sorlie et al., 1995). The present study explores these patterns for a few different causes of death.
The question of whether race/ethnicity has "independent" effects on mortality risk, and whether race/ethnicity effects can be explained by other sociodemographic variables, especially SES, has been examined in the past with mixed results (Christenson and Johnson, 1995; Lillard and Waite, 1995; Mott and Haurin, 1985; Otten et al., 1990; Rogers, 1992; Sorlie et al., 1995). The present study adds to this body of research by testing for the net effects of black/white race on a few causes of death, by age and sex. Like SES, race/ethnicity may have generalized effects and may also be considered a fundamental cause of mortality, in as much as discrimination and access to resources are a function of race/ ethnicity, independent of SES.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
DATA
The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is an annual household survey of the civilian noninstitutionalized population of the United States, conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The National Death Index (NDI) is a database of all deaths in the United States since 1979, also maintained by NCHS. I merged annual NHIS data sets for the

1The meaning of the category DSW varies across age-sex groups. A much higher proportion of the older group (ages 65+) is widowed relative to the younger group (ages 25-64), and males are more often widowed than females (especially in the older group).
2Among males ages 25-64, 54 per cent of the "not in labor force" group are disabled (defined here as "unable to perform major activity"). Among females ages 25-64, 16 per cent are disabled. In the 65+ age group, 20 per cent of (he nonworking males and 17 per cent of the nonworking females are disabled. Labor-force participation rates vary by sex, although in the 65+ age group the sex difference is only about 6 percentage points (87 per cent of males not working, 93 per cent of females).

of twelve months or less before the interview date. Current status measures in this analysis are more susceptible to the confounding influence of (unmeasured) "current" health status, a precursor of subsequent mortality and a potential cause of current income/employment. Given this ambiguity in the direction of relationship between Income and Employment status with mortality (i.e., possible two-way causation), I treat the Income and Employment status variables with less emphasis than the other independent variables. Education is the preferred SES measure because it is measured "earlier in time" and is more stable over the lifecourse.
MODEL ESTIMATION
The NHIS-NDI data set contains the month and year of interview and of death. Cox proportional hazards models are used to estimate the net effects of sociodemographic variables on the monthly hazard of mortality. The assumption of proportionality of hazard rates across sociodemographic subgroups over time was examined in initial analyses and found to be reasonable. Separate models are run for each cause of death, with all other causes treated as censored. Models are also run separately by age-sex group in order to compare effects of sociodemographic variables across groups. Moreover, some dependent variables are not measured or not relevant for every agesex group (e.g., too few breast cancer deaths for males; too few "nonmedical" deaths for the 65+ age group). I used a 10 per cent random sample of survivors and all of the deaths for the multivariate analysis (see Table 1), a sampling strategy which allowed for more efficient data processing while also yielding unbiased estimates of odds ratios. Parameter esti-

mates (odds ratios) were the same as when using the full sample, according to preliminary analysis.
Because NHIS is based on a complex multistage sample design, I used weighted sample data, based on NCHS-suppIied weights, to calculate the hazard model parameter estimates (odds ratios). With these parameter estimates (odds ratios), I calculated significance levels by using standard errors from unweighted analysis, since sample weighting usually causes (upwardly) biased standard errors. On the other hand, due to the clustering feature of the sample design, the standard errors (unweighted) may be underestimated in some cases. Significance levels should therefore be considered approximate. However, weighted and unweighted parameter estimates are very similar and rarely lead to different significance levels. Computations were performed with SAS version 6.08 (Base and PHREG).
A note in terminology. In the multivariate analysis (Table 2), a variable is considered to have an "effect" if its odds ratio is significant at the 0.05 level, although I pay attention to large odds ratios which do not reach the 0.05 level (partly because odds ratios are being compared across subgroups/models of different sample sizes). The multivariate results are discussed in terms of "beneficial" and "detrimental" effects of independent variables. Education, or being married, for example, has a "beneficial effect" if the odds of mortality are reduced by increasing education (or being married), and "detrimental" if the odds are increased.

separately, with the discussions broken down by age group. The 25-64 age group is referred to as "younger" and the 65+ age group as "older."
EDUCATION
Ages 25-64.--The effects of education on ACM are similar for males and females in this age group. Males with high education (college graduates) are 0.71 times less likely to die than are males with low education; the equivalent odds ratio for females is 0.65. The odds ratios indicate a gradient for the education effect on ACM and on most of the separate causes, that is, a college degree is typically more beneficial than a high-school/some-college education, and so on. What stands out here are the sex differences in the effects of education on NONMEDICAL and OTHER MEDICAL causes of death. The effect of education (particularly "high" education) onNONMEDICAL is much stronger for males, while the (beneficial) education effect on OTHER MEDICAL is much stronger for females. The beneficial education effect on LUNG CANCER is somewhat stronger for males as well. As for BREAST CANCER among females, education has a "detrimental effect," consistent with other studies. How-

ever, there is not much of a gradient. College graduates are not at higher risk than are high-school graduates.
Ages 65 and over.--In this age group, education has weaker effects on ACM and cause-specific mortality for both males and females. For males only, high education reduces the risk of LUNG CANCER, basically to the same extent as in the younger group, i.e., there is no decline with age in the effects of education on LUNG CANCER. On other causes of death, the effects of education are close to zero for older males. For females, however, education has a beneficial and significant effect on CIRCULATORY (but not for males). Interestingly, high education has a possible "detrimental effect" on LUNG CANCER for females (OR=1.43), although this odds ratio is not statistically significant.
INCOME AND EMPLOYMENT STATUS
On ACM, income has significant beneficial effects for all age-sex groups with the exception of older females. The effects are stronger in the younger groups for both sexes. Income effects do not vary significantly by sex, though the odds ratios for males are slightly larger than for females.

For the separate causes of death, higher income is associated with better outcomes for most causes and age-sex subgroups, though it is not always statistically significant. The income effects are larger in the younger group than the older group for all causes of death and are slightly larger for males.
For ACM and cause-specific mortality, not working (employment status) has a significant detrimental effect for all agesex groups. The meaning of employment status and the "not working" category as measured in this study varies too much across the age-sex subgroups for the effects to be meaningfully compared. Not surprisingly, the effects are smaller for the older age groups, though there is a larger effect on LUNG CANCER for older men relative to younger. The latter pattern may reflect reverse causation whereby men with long-term lung cancer have dropped out of the labor force, with no such pattern appearing for females because of their lower rates of labor force participation and lung cancer. Within age groups, the employment status effects are generally similar for males and females.
Models were tested with and without income and employment status, though results are shown only for the full models. In general, education and marital-status odds ratios are slightly larger before income and employment status are added to the equation (which applies to most age-sex groups and causes of death), suggesting that the total effects of education and marital status operate partly through income and employment status in affecting the risk of mortality.
MARITAL STATUS
Ages 25-64.--For both sexes, being never-married has a detrimental effect on

ACM relative to married, while divorced/ separated/widowed (DSW) has a slight yet significant effect. The effects of being never-married on separate causes of death depend on sex: for males, being nevermarried lowers the risk (relative to married) of CIRCULATORY but raises the risk for females. The direction of effect for males is unexpected, though not large (OR = 0.74). I explored this relationship with detailed cross-tab tables as well as with models containing interactions (as was done with all variables in earlier analysis), and the effect persists within ten-year age groups, within race groups, and within education groups. It may reflect a process of competing risks, whereby never-married males are more likely to die of other causes, such as OTHER MEDICAL (OR = 3.00). Finally, like the never-married category, DSW's effects on separate causes of death depend on sex. For males only, DSW has a detrimental effect (relative to married) on NONMEDICAL. For females only, DSW has a detrimental effect (relative to married) on LUNG CANCER, and this effect persists in the older group. DSW also has detrimental effects on CIRCULATORY (females only) and OTHER MEDICAL (males and females), and an unexpected "beneficial" effect on OTHER CANCER.among males.
Ages 65 and over.--Marital status has weaker effects on ACM and on causespecific mortality in the older group. Among males in this age group, DSW does have a small but significant detrimental effect on ACM (/><0.05) and a marginal effect on NONMEDICAL (/)<0.10). Never-married has a marginally significant detrimental effect on CIRCULATORY in this subgroup, in contrast to its "beneficial" effect in the younger age group. For older females, there are no marital

status effects on ACM, but DSW raises the risk of LUNG CANCER. Surprisingly, being never-married appears to lower the risk of OTHER MEDICAL, whereas it raises the risk in the younger group.
RACE
Ages 25-64.---For ACM, blacks (males and females) are about 1.3 times more likely to die (i.e., 30 per cent higher risk) after controlling for the other sociodemographic variables. Thus, race does have net effects on ACM in this analysis. For separate causes of death, in the male model blacks are at significantly higher risk of OTHER MEDICAL (OR= 1.67) and
OTHER CANCER (OR =1.33), and at mar-
ginally higher risk of CIRCULATORY (OR = 1.21). In the female model, the race effect is significant for BREAST CANCER (OR= 1.75), LUNG CANCER (OR=1.61), and CIRCULATORY (OR=1.41). For both sexes, the odds ratios for race in the ACM models and separate-cause models are usually larger before controlling for the other sociodemographic variables (not shown), suggesting that the latter variables can explain some but not all of the initial bivariate association between race and mortality. For BREAST CANCER, adding the controls slightly increases the risk to black women, given the positive association between education and breast cancer mortality.
Ages 65 and over.--For females, race has significant net effects on ACM and CIRCULATORY, but for males there are no net effects of race. The weak effects of race in the older groups are consistent with the literature on race cross-over mortality patterns (i.e., white mortality exceeds black mortality at old ages), the causes of which have yet to be resolved (Nam, 1995).
I conclude the Results section by briefly shifting the focus from independent vari-

ables to dependent variables and noting that each cause of death tends to have its own set of sociodemographic determinants, as evidenced by the columns of Table 2. OTHER CANCER stands out as being relatively unaffected by sociodemographic variables compared with other broad causes of death, and this finding applies to both males and females. On the other hand, some causes of death have pronounced sex differences in the determinants, especially in the younger group. LUNG CANCER in males is strongly affected by education (and employment status) but not by income, marital status, or race. For females, LUNG CANCER is affected only by race and marital status (DSW). NONMEDICAL also shows strong sex differences in determinants. For males, it is impacted by almost all of the sociodemographic variables except for race, with its strongest determinants being education and DSW. For females, income is the only significant determinant of NONMEDICAL. The other causes of death also have varying determinants according to sex, but to a lesser degree.
DISCUSSION
This study estimated the net effects of sociodemographic variables on all-cause mortality (ACM) and on a few separate causes of death, with the effects compared across age and sex subgroups. Each of the sociodemographic variables show independent effects on ACM, with effects being similar for males and females but weaker in the older (ages 65+) group. For separate causes of death, the effects of sociodemographic variables are generally weaker across the board in the older group, but there is a complex picture of sex differences in effects.

They did find a detrimental effect of never-married for younger females, which is similar to my results. Rogers (1995) found a detrimental net effect of nevermarried on CIRCULATORY for males but not females. As for my finding of a net effect of never-married on OTHER MEDICAL for older females, no other studies are available for comparison, although the Smith and Waitzman (1994) study reported fairly large (but not significant) beneficial net effects of never-married on ACM and on CIRCULATORY among older females. That study also reported a significant "beneficial" effect of never-married (and widowed) on risk of cancer mortality among low-income men. My results show a simi-
lar effect on OTHER CANCER for men of age
group 25-64.
The results show significant net effects of race on ACM among all age-sex groups with the exception of older males. Looking at separate causes of death among younger males, I find race is significant for three causes and marginally significant for one. In this age-sex group, the largest net effect of race is on OTHER MEDICAL (OR= 1.67), due largely to the higher rate of infectious disease mortality among black men, and to a lesser extent due to their higher rate of diabetes mortality (not shown). For younger females, race is significant for three causes, and marginally significant for one: BREAST CANCER (OR= 1.75), LUNG CANCER (OR=1.61), CIRCULATORY (OR=1.41), and OTHER MEDICAL (OR = 1.24, p< 0.10). In the older age group, the race effects are weaker for both sexes and significant only for females (on ACM and CIRCULATORY). Thus, in general, the net ef-

fects of race are weaker in the older age groups, but similar for males and females of the same age group.
The extent to which race/ethnicity effects on mortality (and health) can be explained by SES and other variables has always been an important yet difficult question. My models reveal a nontrivial residual race effect, as do some other multivariate studies. There are several individual-level and contextual variables that, if measurable in this study, would probably reduce the race "effect" to zero. Wealth, income stability, residential segregation, physical environment and neighborhood quality, access to quality medical care, and discrimination (which cuts across all of the above) need further study. Some studies already find that race differences in ACM disappear when income and demographic variables are controlled (Rogers, 1992). Rogers' study used a different research design and data set, and the data/models were not presented by age or by sex. Further research in this area is needed to create a body of findings that can be analyzed as a whole.
While it is likely that SES, race/ethnicity, and marital status have both "generalized" and specific effects on mortality risk (Marmot et al., 1984), analysis of this issue is beyond the scope of this study. The fact that SES and other sociodemographic variables have been shown in previous studies to affect allcause mortality, even after controlling for proximate determinants or medical risk factors, may be partly due to their generalized effects, in addition to measurement error in socioeconomic variables (Preston
