Changing age-specific fertility rates in rural Haiti may reflect changes in length of reproductive life span, age at entry into union, stability of unions, weaning practices, child survivorship, use of contraception, and health status of women in their reproductive ages. In an attempt to evaluate the roles of these factors, a longitudinal study was conducted in 23 villages in rural Haiti from January 1,1968, through July 1, 1972. From a population of 1,865 women, a random sample was chosen for detailed study. The analysis of data from the longitudinal study of the entire population is in process. The findings of the sample study are presented here.
The sample study indicates that there is only a slightly rising trend in the agespecific fertility rate and that, over the short run, the increasing survival of children has had little effect on fertility. It was observed that women in stable conjugal unions--either marriage or consensual unions--had a higher total fertility rate than women in relatively unstable unions. This fact is important in explaining the continuing high fertility rates among women with high parity and high child survivorship, since these are most often members of stable unions.

BACKGROUND
Haiti shares the four-hundred-mile-long Island of Hispaniola in the Caribbean with the Spanish-speaking Dominican Republic. French in outlook, the black population has grown to five million since independence in 1804 (U.S. State Department, 1972). As the most densely populated nation in the Americas (467 per square mile), the nation "teems with a restless energy to catch up with the rest of the world" (Scofield, 1961, p. 228).
Haiti's economy depends on the production and export of agricultural goods. Natural disasters, lack of technical advances, and isolation because of language have held back Haiti's economic progress. The rural areas, where 82 per cent of the population is located, have become a recent focus of planning for development (Beamer etal., 1972).
The population growth rate of Haiti, about 2 per cent per year, is not unusually high compared to some other countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia. However, the population growth seems especially critical in Haiti due to a lack of immediate available resources and poor prospects for economic advancement for the individual

Haitian. Furthermore, virtually all suitable land is now under cultivation, and the density on this cultivated land is 1,600 persons per square mile, greater than any other area in the world except Java and the Nile Delta. Comparable figures are: Peru, SIS; Dominican Republic, 516; Jamaica, 945 (U.S. Department of State, 1972).
Haiti is one of two Latin American countries which have taken only two censuses since 1900. The source of much published Haitian data is based on estimates from the 1950 census. Final results of the 1971 census are not yet available.
Vital statistics in Haiti are difficult to substantiate. Since a birth certificate is costly to the rural Haitian farmer who must purchase it, Haitians frequently do not register births; newborn children who die may escape being registered officially as either a birth or a death. The Haitian Institute of Statistics published estimates for vital rates in 1969, including a crude rate of 37.3 births per 1,000 population based on figures from the National Malaria Eradication Service, reports by military installations, and water distribution census studies for the city of Port-au-Prince. They estimated a population of 4.3 million for 1969, which is consistent with preliminary results of the 1971 census. However, other estimates vary. A recently published study (Corning, 1973) estimated a 1970 population of 5.3 million, a crude birth rate of 45 per 1,000 population, and the age-specific fertility rates presented in Table 1.
A rural community health program needs to investigate vital rates to evaluate its programs. At the same time, such efforts provide valuable information with which to study the dynamics of population change. A combined effort of the Community Health Department of the Albert Schweitzer Hospital and of the Harvard School of Public Health attempted to achieve these

goals of evaluation and research in one area of rural Haiti.
The Albert Schweitzer Hospital is located in the densely populated, centrally located Artibonite River Valley. It has a staff of 10-15 physicians and 30 nurses and treats about 6,000 outpatients per month. Since 1967, the community health program has been providing preventive health services such as immunization, training in nutrition, and education in family planning to the 90,000 people residing in the district served by the hospital (Berggren, 1974).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
From the district surrounding the hospital, an area of ten square miles was selected for the establishment of a vital statistics reporting system. This area included 23 villages of varying sizes with a total 1970 population of 9,217. The population pyramid from this census closely matched that of the National Malaria Eradication survey, with 30 per cent of the population in the 0-9 year age group. Beginning in 1967, an annual census became the basis for a "family register." Voluntary collaborators in each village had reported weekly on births, deaths, migrations, and any evidence of severe malnutrition in children since 1967.
In 1968 and 1969, analysis of the census and registration data for the first years of the program documented the birth rates of about 35 per 1,000 for the study, a

figure below published estimates for Haiti. To investigate this discrepancy and to examine determinants of fertility, a field survey was conducted in 1970.
This demographic study made it possible to study the effects of infectious disease on population dynamics. Berggren and Berggren (1971, p. 492) wrote the following report on this community as studied in 1969:
A total of 1,629 mothers, ranging in age between IS and 60 years, gave a complete history of all their live-born children; of these mothers, 585 (36%) had lost at least one child with tetanus of the newborn. There were 7,248 live births, of which 1,143 (16%) were reported to have died of tetanus of the newborn.
Child loss, therefore, had played an important role in population dynamics.
Other infectious disease data were available from the hospital's 1969 tuberculosis survey which screened the census tract inhabitants and treated 2.8 per cent of them as active cases. Malnutrition was the diagnosis most often made by pediatricians on the children in the study area.
In addition to annual censuses conducted since 1967, ongoing birth, death, and migration reports for each household were collected by village volunteers. Reasons for each migration, such as "to form (or dissolve) a conjugal union," were also recorded. This combined information formed the family register for each household in the study area.
In 1970, census takers collected information about infant and child deaths and live births for each woman bom after 1910. Each event was recorded by date of birth, present status, and, in case of death, the cause of death. An events calendar was used to help the respondents establish dates as accurately as possible. Separate birth and death registers for each village were crosschecked against these birth histories from 1968 onwards to assure that the informa-

tion was consistent with the ongoing records. About 80 per cent of the women also had hospital records as a result of the tuberculosis survey or their prenatal clinic visits. Pertinent information from these records, such as gynecologic surgery, was added to the information collected for each of the women. An interview questionnaire completed fertility information on a 20 per cent random sample chosen from the total population.
The analysis of these data proceeded with three primary objectives: (1) to identify any trend or sudden variations in the age-specific fertility rates over time and seek explanations for them; (2) to investigate the hypothesis that the recent lowering of infant mortality was reducing fertility in this population; and (3) to evaluate the impact of unstable conjugal unions on fertility. A practical goal of the field investigators was to determine the degree to which information collected on the entire population of women could be expected to be corroborated. To achieve this goal, a sample of women was asked to verify and complete their fertility information through a detailed interview questionnaire schedule.
From the 1970 census, all 1,865 women in the study area had been listed by name, age, and address. The list of women of ages 15-49 was divided into five-year age groups. From each of these subgroups, a systematic 20 per cent sample was selected using a random numbers table. A detailed study of fertility proceeded among these 425 women. The age distribution within the sample was identical to that in the population. In 31 cases in which women selected by this procedure were outmigrants who could not be located, replacements were chosen from women whose names were next on the list after the original choice. If one assumes that women who migrate are not significantly different in fertility behavior, this departure from randomness will not

significantly affect the results. And, even if it does, 31 out of 424 cases is a relatively small proportion.
QUESTIONNAIRE PROCEDURE
Each woman in the sample was questioned about her age, year of birth, number of live and still births, pregnancy losses, year of birth for each child, number of children presently alive, and the year and cause of death for each dead child.
After pretesting, the questionnaire was administered in the local language of Creole by trained Haitian interviewers who were on the staff of the Community Health Department. Women were invited to the department to be interviewed "about their health and that of their children." Of 424 women invited, 368 came on the first invitation and 56 came on the second.
Although the major focus was on the pregnancy history, questions were included on the number of months spent in conjugal union and the sicknesses of the respondent. Each stated period of prolonged amenorrhea unexplained by lactation or pregnancy was reviewed with the respondent in detail to determine any pregnancy wastage. At the end of the interview, a blood sample was obtained for hemogram determination, with an explanation to the woman including a plan for follow-up.
The interview data were cross-checked with hospital and census records. In cases where information on interview sheets was not consistent, especially on the question of the presence of a male consort, ongoing migration reports of cohabitation were used to correct the response. Information about folk methods of contraception, including coitus interruptus, was recorded in a dozen instances when the women volunteered the information.
Desired family size could not be asked directly. However, the women responded consistently to the question "How many

children did you ask God to give you?" Women below age 19 were asked about their age at menarche; any woman over 35 with an extended period of amenorrhea was systematically asked if she estimated this to be due to beginning menopause, prolonged lactation, or pregnancy. Follow-up was available at the hospital's prenatal clinic for doubtful cases. Answers to these questions provided an estimate of the average length of the reproductive lifetime for women in the sample.
ANALYSIS OF BIRTH HISTORIES
The birth histories collected on each of 425 women contained: (1) year of birth of the mother, (2) year of birth of all live or still births and pregnancy losses, and (3) year of death of all nonsurviving children. Since less than one-third of the population had birth certificates, the researchers considered the dates obtained by use of events calendars to be reasonably close to the actual dates. Without data to indicate the extent of error involved in calculating the dates for vital events, no attempt could be made during the analysis to adjust the age groups using specific multipliers developed for this purpose.
Using these data, three sets of agespecific fertility rates were calculated corresponding to three classification systems: (1) All births to women in this sample were tabulated by the age of the mother and the calendar year of birth. (2) Births occurring between January, 1968, and July, 1972, during which time all births were observed by the investigators, were classified by age and parity of the mother. (3) Births during 1968--72 were classified by age of mother and the number of surviving siblings. In addition, the number of women in the sample was tabulated, using the same classifications, to yield estimates of number of women at risk for childbirth in each category of age, parity, and survivorship of

RESULTS
Averaging the highest and lowest total fertility rate estimates gives a fertility rate of 5,925 per 1,000 women. The usual interpretation of this fact is that, unless fertility rates change, a woman who reaches her last fertile age in this population may expect about six (S.9) liveborn children. However, on the average, 50 per cent of the total woman-months-at-risk during the observation years 1968 through 1971 were spent

The estimate of the age at menopause is further corroborated by the fact that no birth was reported to any woman over age 45 during the observation period. This gives a rough estimate for a reproductive life span of thirty years between the ages fourteen and forty-four, which is comparable to estimates obtained for Punjab villages in India.
Using the fertility rate {FR) of women 15-44, the crude birth rate was estimated by the formula:

Controlled for parity, the rates declined rapidly with age; however, if controlled for age, they rise with parity and decline only moderately after parity six. These trends could indicate that if women in this sample control fertility effectively only after "too many" children, then they must have about six children before becoming so motivated. However, infertility may exist for other reasons, such

The majority of women "ask God" for jour children (according to questionnaire results) but seem to accept any other given number, For example, a respondent-with six children would say, "I asked God for four, but He gave me six . . . ," impressing the interviewer with her happiness about this fact.
In this case study, age at entry into union was late, about 21 years of age. Women completing their childbearing years in stable unions generally had a completed family size of eight or more; those in relatively unstable unions had an average of only four children. For each woman in the sample, information was available on the period spent in and out of union, by

type of union during 1968-72. From these data, using a modification of Blake's method (1955), the estimate of reduction in fertility due to lack of exposure is about 22.5 per cent (Murthy, 1973).

women, and may not be applicable to Haiti in 1970.
Among the important questions for consideration in analysis of data from the Haiti study is the relation between numbers of surviving children and completed family size. It is difficult to draw conclusions on this point because the data in our study are derived from a sample of relatively small size, so that the standard error in estimating rates may be high. Furthermore, the factors which influence the relationship between fertility and child mortality, such as health of the mother and presence of a male consort, could not be controlled. Throughout Haiti's history, high child mortality has been a serious threat to the population and continues to be so now, as evidenced by the finding that more than 25 per cent of all the children born to the 425 women in our group had died (Table 6). This is a relatively high percentage compared to that in several other rural populations. If child mortality has a strong influence on the decision to have children (Hassen, 1966; Heer and Smith, 1968), the family size norm would still be expected to be high in this population, although supporting data for this hypothesis are not available. Furthermore, child mortality in the study population served by the hospital has very recently declined substantially. There was a SOper cent survival rate among

children born to women age 45-49 in the sample, increasing to a 75 per cent survival rate for children born to women age 40-44 (see Table 6). This sudden decline in child mortality corresponds to a drop in infant mortality attributed to a neonatal tetanus prevention program (Berggren and Berggren, 1971). Reduction in child mortality in this population has occurred too recently to have influenced local social norms, but it can be noted that fertility in all ages except 15-19 declined in the last decade. Increased child survival may have some role in it.
Six other major factors which influence the fertility rate are: (1) primary and secondary sterility, (2) health of the mothers, (3) length of the reproductive life span, (4) lack of pregnancy due to unstable conjugal unions, (5) prolonged lactation, and (6) relatively late age at entry into conjugal union.
In this sample of women, sterility was confirmed in 2.6 per cent of women age 35 and above who did not produce children during the observation period. This estimate of primary sterility is consistent with the figure reported by Wyon and Gordon (1971) for Punjab villages in India. The incidence of venereal disease was less than 5 per cent in women attending the prenatal clinic. Pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy were reported in less

than 1 per cent of these women. Two other health problems may have had
some bearing on fertility. First, 16 per cent of women had hemoglobin levels below 10 grams, and second, about 1 per cent of the general population of adult women in the census tract was diagnosed as suffering from active tuberculosis.
The age at menopause reported by this population is relatively early (about 44 years) compared with United States women, for whom the average age at menopause was estimated to be 49 years (MacMahon and Worcester, 1966). Wyon (1966) found in India's rural Punjab that the age of menopause was 44 years, very much below that observed in the United States. If we attribute this to poor health of Punjabi women, the same reasoning may be applicable to Haitian women, providing some indication about a probable link between poor health and infertility in this population.
Poor health and poverty are often associated with increases in rates of spontaneous abortions in some societies (Chennatamby, 1962). However, no such evidence could be found in the sample because it is difficult for these women to be certain about early abortions. It is not uncommon in this population for women to have prolonged amenorrhea while lactating, followed by very heavy menstrual flow. With prolonged amenorrhea, women cannot always be certain whether or not the first "heavy period" thereafter represents a pregnancy loss.
Unstable conjugal unions are alleged to depress fertility rates (Ibberson, 1956; Roberts, 1957; Blake, 1961; Stycos and Back, 1964). However, one West Indian study showed that fertility was not depressed because of unstable unions, presumably because of the desire to "cement" unions by production of offspring (Ram and Ebanks, 1973). As is reported in most

Caribbean islands and in certain African countries, unions in Haiti are characteristically unstable (Beamer et al., 1972). Legal marriages are relatively more stable than consensual unions (Schaedel, 1962). Multiple unions are more of a rule than an exception, since more than 50 per cent of the unions are of second or higher order (Rawson and Berggren, 1973). The result of the instability of these Haitian unions is that there is considerable time between unions when a woman is not at risk for pregnancy.
Blake (1955) estimates the total loss of fertility in Jamaica from lack of exposure to be about 33 per cent, assuming that each woman's fertility would have been the same in her nonunion period as it was in the period she spent in unions. Murthy's similar findings (1973) suggest that rural Haitian unions are no more unstable than those of their Caribbean neighbors.
Pregnancy wastage and contraception are also important determinants of fertility control. In this sample, modern contraception played a very minor role. Intrauterine devices were first introduced through the Albert Schweitzer Hospital to this population in 1965; family planning education was added in 1967, but until 1970 the acceptance rate was very low. At no time were more than 5 per cent of women using IUD's. An analysis of IUD experience, including cumulative net continuation rate at the end of one year, compared well to other populations (Berggren et al., 1974).
Pregnancy histories indicate that induced abortions are practically nonexistent. This observation was corroborated from the women's hospital records where no induced abortions or complications thereof had been noted.
The remaining factor that may have some effect on fertility is the practice of prolonged breast feeding among these women, since breast feeding lengthens the period of post-

partum anovulation during which conception is not feasible (Potter et al., 1965). Although no quantitative measures were available for this particular sample, data collected on three hundred mothers having hospital records show that these women lactate, on an average, for 18 months. This long lactation period has the effect of increasing the length of the birth interval and thus reducing the fertility rate.
Finally, comparison of the age-specific fertility estimates by the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population with the corresponding rates from our 1958-62 sample shows that the published estimates were consistently higher for all ages, except for ages 30-34. The rates found here seem to corroborate the Haitian Bureau of Statistics' lower estimate of Haiti's crude birth rate.
IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE POPULATION TRENDS
One of the main problems in projecting future population trends is that census and registration data for some populations are not consistently available.
In a recent attempt at classification of all countries in Latin America on the basis of increasing, decreasing, or stable population trends, Haiti was one of three high fertility countries where little information was available to indicate either change or stability (Conning, 1973). The present case study indicates a slight decline in agespecific fertility rates, which may or may not exist after adjusting for errors in estimation. However, should unions become more stable, rural Haiti can probably expect a corresponding increase in number of births. This seems unlikely, since imbalanced sex ratios due to outmigration of young males from the rural areas of Haiti will probably persist. Roberts (1957) writes of the British Caribbean that the persistent and marked imbalance of the sexes may

have contributed to the development of prevailing family forms, in this case the unstable consensual union.
The fertility of rural Haitian women does not reach the biological maximum, largely because of the relative irregularity of conjugal unions. Health-related problems and late age at entry also play a role.
Although no statement can be made about the changes in patterns of union, Haitian mothers in the future may follow the Caribbean pattern of shortening the period of lactation. I t is also likely that some of the health problems impairing fertility may be solved in the near future, removing that barrier to fertility. When and if these barriers are removed, there will be the question of whether or not Haitian women will have to resort to illegal induced abortion, which has become a method of fertility control in many Latin American countries. Induced abortion appeared to be nonexistent in 1970 in this rural case study. It is hoped that Haiti's national family planning program will spread rapidly enough to prevent such a development.
Population growth rates in rural Haiti are such that economic growth and cultural adaptation are inhibited. Introduction of modern methods of contraception alone will not be sufficient to fully correct the disproportionate growth rate. The authors are convinced that health education of Haiti's rural families, combined with comprehensive health care to reduce child mortality, is an essential prerequisite to making family planning programs acceptable or effective in rural Haiti.
