value orientations as being independent of other factors that influence fertility behavior; rather, they are considered as intermediate factors in a developmental sequence that includes a variety of antecedent variables. These variables influence value orientations and through this influence may also affect fertility behavior. One such set of antecedent sociocultural factors is represented by the variable socioeconomic status. It is well established that fertility behavior varies with socioeconomic status. Previously reported data (Clifford, 1969) showed that higher socioeconomic status is positively associated with most modern value orientations. Modern nature, time, relational, and sex orientations are generally characteristic of high status wives and traditional orientations of low status wives. The reverse is true only for orientation to activity. The implications of this reversal will be discussed later.
For reasons of brevity, the present analysis does not report the relationship between value orientations and fertility behavior with socioeconomic status controlled. However, the introduction of such a control did not materially alter the nature or direction of the associations, although it did reduce their magnitude.
Our primary purpose here is to report a test of the following hypothesis regarding attitudes toward nature, time, familial relations, activity, and sex: Wives who have a modern orientation to any one of these items will expect a smaller number of children, will have a smaller proportion of unplanned births,'and will have lower fertility than wives who have a traditional orientation. Beyond this, our interest lies in interpreting some of the observed results of the tests of this hypothesis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data on which the present study is based were obtained from a project on family

formation and values conducted in Lexington, Kentucky, during the spring of 1968 (see Stokes, 1970; Clifford, 1969). A 20 per cent sample of women was drawn by a systematic procedure from birth registration records. The population sampled was denned as resident white nonfarm females who had a legitimate live birth in Fayette County, Kentucky, during the period January 1,1967, to December 31,1967. This procedure yielded a primary list of 500 potential respondents. This list was further reduced by excluding all couples in which the husband and wife were no longer living together, students, the pretest sample, and couples in which the wife was foreign-born. These exclusions resulted in the elimination of ninety-seven couples.
Of the 403 eligible respondents, 275 were interviewed, a completion rate of 68 per cent. Out-of-town moves accounted for the largest number of missing interviews. The remainder could not be located after repeated call-backs. The effective sample size was further reduced by the elimination of Roman Catholics, because meaningful religious comparisons could not be made due to the paucity of cases. Thus, the analysis is based on the responses of 240 resident white Protestant nonfarm females.
A few points regarding the sample design should be made. Since all respondents in the sample had at least one child, observed differences in fertility are not due to differences in fecundity of the groups. Moreover, group comparisons dealing with the fertility behavior variables are very conservative tests of the model. Women who were fecund, who did not want children, and who successfully prevented conception, are excluded from the sample. Consequently, group differences may be understated as a result of omitting these fecund women with successful planning.

VALUE ORIENTATIONS AND EXPECTED FAMILY SIZE
All wives were asked a question concerning the total number of children they actually expected to have. This question is believed to provide a much more realistic indicator of size of completed family than a question on the number of children wanted or any other measure of attitudes toward family size.
The hypothesis that wives who have a modern orientation will expect fewer children than wives who have a traditional orientation is upheld for two of the value orientations--nature and relational--as seen from the data in Table 2. The differences in the mean number of children expected by modern and traditional nature and relational orientations are significant at the 0.01 level.
For the nature orientation, there appears to be no difference in expectations between modern and intermediate wives. In the case of the relational orientation, the intermediate group expects a significantly larger number of children on the average than the modern group. The correlations of nature and relational orientations with expectations are consistent with the hypothesis, 0.18 and 0.12 respectively.

While the nature and relational orientations are closely related to mean expected family size, and in the hypothesized direction, the measures of time, activity, and sex do not provide similar results. In fact, the time and activity data generally indicate a direct reversal of the hypothesis.

VALUE ORIENTATIONS AND BIRTH CONTROL EFFECTIVENESS
Thus far in the analysis, the only dependent variable considered has been the mean number of children expected by the wives. Of equal if not greater significance is the extent to which the couple has evidenced control over conception. Many studies in the United States have demonstrated that there are relatively minor variations in the

The data presented in Table 3 show the

The traditional groups exhibit the least successful planning and the modern groups, the most successful. The intermediate groups generally lie in the middle in planning effectiveness.

relation between the various value orientations and birth control effectiveness. It appears that the nature, relational, and sex orientations discriminate between modern and traditional groups with respect to birth control effectiveness as predicted. Theproportions of unplanned births for the modern and intermediate groups are quite similar, but are in the expected direction with the exception of the relational orientation.

some of the observed variation might be attributable to this variable.
The measure of time and activity orientations deviate somewhat from the general pattern set above. With respect to the time orientation, there is virtually no difference between the modern group and the traditional group, and the small difference which does exist is in the wrong direction. Another interesting point is that the intermediate group has the largest proportion of unplanned births. Because the correlation is so low (--0.01), the hypothesis cannot be said to be confirmed.
As for the activity orientation, the data indicate a direct reversal of the hypothesized relationship. Those women with a modern activity orientation are characterized by a significantly larger proportion of unplanned births than those traditional in activity orientation. The correlation of --0.06 indicates a reversal of the direction

VALUE ORIENTATIONS AND ACTUAL FERTILITY
The data pertaining to the hypothesis predicting modern orientations and low mean number of births are presented in Table 4. Inspection of the table reveals that the differences in the mean numbers of births by modern and traditional orientations for the nature, time, and relational orientations are not significant. This lack of difference is also reflected in the low correlations of nature (0.0S), time (--0.01), and relational (--0.03) orientations with actual fertility.
As for activity and sex orientations, the data indicate a direct reversal of the hypothesis relating modern orientations to low fertility. Those women modern in these orientations are characterized by higher fertility than their traditional counterparts. The negative correlations of activity

(--0.20) and sex (--0.1S) orientations with actual fertility provide further support for a reversal of the direction of the hypothesis.
In summary, of the five measures of the independent value orientations, the nature and relational orientations provide some support for the hypothesized relation between modern orientations and low fertility behavior (preferences, unplanned births, and fertility). The significance of the time and sex orientations is questionable due to the many inconsistencies in the data. The relation of the activity orientation to fertility behavior is a complicated one, both from the standpoint of what the data indicate and its interpretation. The results generally indicate a direct reversal of the hypothesis.
On the whole, the results of the analysis are more puzzling than explanatory. They are so diverse as to admit many alternate interpretations.
DISCUSSION
SEX ORIENTATION
There are many inconsistencies in the sex orientation data which makes interpretation extremely difficult. We hypothesized that a modern sex orientation would be associated with small family-size expectations, fertility-planning success, and a small family size. However, the findings indicate three different patterns: (1) sex orientation is not related to fertility expectations, or, at best, is weakly associated; (2) the sex orientation scale does discriminate birth control effectiveness as predicted; and (3) sex orientation is associated with actual fertility, but in the opposite direction from that hypothesized. Apparently, where sex is defined "traditionally" as basically evil and is not a mutually gratifying experience, the couple is less effective in its fertility planning (Table 3). However, it is also true that if the wife has a negative viewpoint about sex, her family is much

more likely to be small than if she does not. In other words, women who have a modern orientation to sex have larger families than women with a traditional orientation, even though the former are more effective family planners.
Much more systematic research must be done to untangle the intricacies of the relationship between orientations to sex and fertility behavior. Individual feelings about sex are extremely complex and often contradictory. Interview data of the kind collected in this study cannot be expected to embrace the full complexity of the way respondents view sex.
ACTIVITY ORIENTATION
As noted earlier, the activity orientation is related to fertility behavior, but in the opposite direction from that hypothesized. These negative relations contradicted expectations, since a modern activity orientation was conceived as positively associated with fertility behavior.
On the basis of the findings presented here, it is possible that a shift has occurred in the value orientations of the various soicoeconomic status groups. A study by Kahl (1965) supports this viewpoint. He suggests that open and frank avowal of male values of "determination and driving ambition," to use the phrasing of one of our items, is most characteristic of a person in the working class, especially one who has achieved some occupational success as a skilled worker without much educational preparation. It is the expressed attitude of a "striver."
Kahl maintains that men with more education strive less openly and vigorously, but have other values that in fact aid them to reach a level of occupational success higher than that of the striver. These values of the middle and upper classes, which are more subtle and more directly connected with success, are possible only because the basic

Vol. 21, No. 2

minimum of material success is taken for granted.
A study by Mizruchi (1964) supports this interpretation. He says that most respondents told him that it was important for them "to get ahead in life," but that it was somewhat more important to persons in the working class than to those in the middle class. If this view is correct, then the basic idea presented earlier must be modified. We maintained that a modern activity orientation is one in which there is a preference for the kind of activity which results in measurable accomplishments, particularly occupational success. Apparently the modern individual is success oriented, but in more subtle ways.
It seems reasonable to assume that the middle class modern individual has shifted from open and frank avowal of a determination to succeed to a more relativistic orientation. He has a more qualified view of success and therefore rejects "determination and driving ambition" as central to his value system. In the working class, where some occupational success has been achieved and where material success is not taken for granted, agreement with the simplistic imperative is more likely to obtain.
It seems reasonably clear that it would be possible to continue to utilize the measure of orientation to activity as developed, reversing the modern-traditional positions.5 However, it would appear to be more profitable to develop more sensitive instruments to get at the nuances of the situation rather than just the extremes.
TIME ORIENTATION
It was hypothesized that a modern time orientation would be associated with low fertility preferences, fertility-planning success, and a small family size. The results
5 Such a procedure was in fact employed in a recent study (Brown, 1970) which found that activity items correlated negatively with nature, relational, and time orientations in a constructed traditionism-modernism scale.

indicate that time orientation is not directly related to fertility behavior. Perhaps in an economic system such as that of the United States, which permits the spreading of costs over a longer period of time, a future or present orientation may not be relevant to the issue of family planning goals and contraception because of the belief that the consequences of having children can be worked out.
This view does not suggest that time orientation is not relevant in explaining other behavior. In fact, it is entirely possible that time orientation operates through other variables that affect fertility behavior directly. Freedman and Coombs (1966) found that wives who expect their husbands to have a large income increase over the next ten-year period expect more additional children than others. Such wives also had more children during a follow-up period. Furthermore, Freedman and Coombs found that plans to send children to college, when backed by actual savings for this purpose, are related to expecting fewer children and to spacing the children more widely. It is quite evident that a future orientation-- which has an important bearing on one's ability to plan and means that one looks ahead--is related to perceived increase in income over a ten-year period and to savings for sending children to college. Thus, it is possible to infer that time orientation operates through other variables which have direct consequences for fertility behavior.
It might be tentatively concluded that time orientation is not directly related to fertility behavior and is not one of the elements of the constellation of modern-traditional value orientations that directly explain variations in fertility behavior. Possible future research might reveal that the time orientation operates through variables which affect fertility behavior directly. If this is actually the case, it will be necessary to identify these intervening variables.

At this point, the above interpretations concerning the fertility behavior effects of independent value orientations must be viewed aslargely speculative. It is apparent that more investigation is needed concerning the relationships between the separate

value orientations andtherelationship between them and fertility behavior.
