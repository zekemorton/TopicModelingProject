ABSTRACT: This paper assesses the effects of changes in women's education and labor force participation on nuptiality patterns and their implications for fertility decline in Venezuela. Results show that together with delays in union formation, changes in women's education and labor force participation produced a different, more "modern" type of consensual union, which coexists with "traditional" consensual unions. "Traditional" consensual unions remain a substitute for formal marriage among women from rural origins with low levels of education and higher levels of work experience. "Modern" consensual unions appear to be an option for well-educated women of urban origins. As in developed countries, these unions assume the form of a trial period before marriage or an alternative to singlehood. "Modern" consensual unions are more unstable than "traditional" consensual unions and they are associated with lower fertility.

The rapid extension and widespread availability of modern contraception has been recognized as the main factor behind the fertility decline in Latin America during the past three decades (Moreno and Singh, 1992). Changes in nuptiality patterns, on the other hand, appear to have played a trivial role in the fertility transition for the region as a whole, despite significant variation across countries (RoseroBixby, 1996). Venezuela is one of the few Latin American countries where changes in nuptiality patterns figured prominently in the process of fertility decline from 6.5 in the 1960's to 3.4 in the 1990's. During the same period the singulate mean age at marriage for Venezuelan women increased more than three years, from 18.1 in 1960 to 21.2 in 1980. An assessment of the changes and correlates of nuptiality patterns and their implications for fertility decline in Venezuela are the main objectives of this paper.
Due to the extended prevalence of consensual unions in Latin America, a study

of nuptiality trends needs to consider both changes in timing and prevalence of first union and in type of union being formed. A substantial social science literature has shown that changes in female education and labor force participation in the process of modernization translate into new roles and aspirations for women that often conflict with the traditional roles of wife and mother, hence increasing the age at marriage and the proportion of women remaining single (Mason, 1993). However, the effects of modernization on the "choice" between a consensual or a legal union have been less clearly specified. Because consensual unions in Latin America traditionally have been prevalent among women from rural backgrounds, with low levels of education, and higher rates of labor force experience, we would expect that improvements in the social status of women could lower the prevalence of consensual unions. However, if modernization in developing countries is accompanied by greater female independence

and ideational changes from altruism to individualism, as is the case in more developed societies (Van de Kaa, 1987), we might expect an increase in the prevalence of consensual unions among the most "modern" groups of the society.
These two effects are not incompatible. Improvements in women's status could lower the prevalence of consensual unions among women with low education and, at the same time, increase the prevalence of consensual unions among highly educated women. We hypothesize that together with delays in union formation, changes in women's status triggered the emergence of a different, more "modern" type of consensual union in Venezuela, which coexists along with "traditional" consensual unions. "Traditional" consensual unions can be regarded as a substitute to formal marriage among women of low socioeconomic origins. Partly stemming from their non-binding legal status, "traditional" consensual unions are more unstable than formal marriages and could be harmful for women and children because male responsibilities toward the family either do not exist or are difficult to enforce.1 "Modern" consensual unions, on the other hand, assume the form of either a trial period before marriage or an alternative to singlehood (Rindfuss and VandenHeuvel, 1990). These unions appear to be an option for well-educated women of urban origins. These "modern" consensual unions are associated with

lower fertility outcomes and are usually less stable than "traditional" consensual unions.
The following section locates Venezuela within the broader context of Latin America and identifies its uniqueness and importance as a case study. In the absence of nationally representative demographic data with retrospective marriage histories differentiated by type of union, we focus our empirical analysis on a recent fertility survey conducted in the capital city of Caracas and its surrounding metropolitan area in 1991. A review of studies about changes in women's roles and nuptiality patterns identifies key correlates of union formation and union type. The empirical analysis addresses several questions. First, how did the changes in women's roles, as measured by educational attainment and labor market experience, affect the timing of first unions in Venezuela? Second, how did these factors affect the "choice" between a consensual or a legal union? Third, what are the dissolution and childbearing patterns associated with both types of unions? The conclusion considers what the coexistence of "modern" and "traditional" forms of consensual unions portends for fertility decline in Venezuela.
BACKGROUND
TRENDS IN UNION FORMATION: VENEZUELA IN THE
LATIN AMERICAN CONTEXT

1Several reforms to the Civil Code of Venezuela were introduced in 1982 that modified the juridical status of married women imposing equality of rights and duties and that eliminated the discrimination between legitimate and illegitimate children (Esparsa, 1990-91).

Several recent studies have tried to assess the changes in patterns of marriage and household behavior in Latin America (ECLA, 1988, ECLA, 1993; Palloni et al., 1994; De Vos et al., 1995; De Vos, 1987), and their contribution to fertility decline.

For the region as a whole, Rosero-Bixby (1996) concluded that changes in marriage patterns have played a trivial role in the fertility transition, although he admits exceptions to this regional generalization. Venezuela is such an exception, along with the Dominican Republic. In these two countries changes in marriage patterns appear to have contributed substantially to fertility decline. In other countries, like Ecuador and Guatemala, the contribution of nuptiality to fertility decline was modest, but nontrivial. Yet a third group of countries, including Colombia and Costa Rica witnessed only modest nuptiality contributions to fertility decline. Other countries, including Brazil, Peru, and Chile, showed oscillations in the effects of marriage on fertility. Finally, in El Salvador, Panama, and Paraguay, marriage patterns actually retarded fertility decline (RoseroBixby, 1996). Conceivably, the varied associations between nuptiality and fertility changes may stem from differences in the timing and nature of union type.
Delays in the timing of first marriage largely depend on the starting age at first marriage for the period under consideration. Between 1950 and 1980, the singulate mean age at marriage for Latin America increased slightly from 21 to 22 years of age (United Nations, 1990). However, both the starting SMAM's and the changes in the timing of marriage were considerably variable for the region. The largest changes in the timing of first union occurred in those countries with early initiation of first marriage in 1950. Venezuelan women increased their mean age at first marriage by 3 years, Guatemalan women by 2 years, and Panamanian women by 3 years. Of the remaining countries in the region, Colombia and Peru experienced an increase in SMAM of 1 year or more, but the rest of

the region did not show any important changes. This finding provides a hint about why changes in nuptiality are more closely linked to fertility decline in Venezuela compared to other countries.
The historical prevalence of consensual unions in Latin America complicates the analysis of marriage patterns and their consequences for family formation (Quilodran, 1985; Trindade Henriques, 1982). In some countries, mostly in the Caribbean basin (United Nations, 1990), consensual unions are more prevalent than legal marriages. Countries characterized by an early pattern of first marriage generally have the highest prevalence of consensual unions. The largest shares of consensual unions for women aged 15-49 who are currently in union occur in the Dominican Republic, followed by Panama, Guatemala, and Venezuela. In general, the share of consensual unions tends to decline at older ages. However, Venezuela stands out as the Latin American country where the prevalence of consensual unions is most stable across the age spectrum. The share of consensual unions relative to legal marriages remains above 30 per cent across all age groups. This provides a second clue--and puzzle--about the significance of nuptiality change for fertility decline.
Within the Latin American context, Venezuela is an interesting case study because it is one of the few countries that experienced a substantial delay in the timing of first marriages, and because changes in marriage timing appears to be a significant mechanism behind the fertility decline in the country (Tienda et al., 1995). That consensual unions are prevalent among all age groups invites a detailed analysis of the mechanisms producing consensual vs. legal unions to further clarify how changes in women's roles affected the "choice" of

union type, and how these changes undergird Venezuela's fertility decline.
THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS
As one of the proximate determinants of fertility, the timing of marriage is an important source of fertility regulation. Delays in the timing of first union are relevant not only because they reduce the amount of time women are exposed to the risk of conception, but also because they reflect an environment conducive to alternative social roles for women (Coale, 1992). As the process of modernization unfolds, changes in the material well-being and in the value structure of a society motivate delays in the timing of first marriages, which in turn, are shaped by women's roles before and after marriage.
In a cross-country comparison, McDonald (1985) showed that lower ages at marriage were associated with rural societies, low levels of education for both men and women, and low rates of female labor force participation before or after marriage. The strongest and most consistent predictor of later ages at marriage are women's education and employment in nonagricultural activities. Therefore, he suggested that the completion of primary education shifts the age at marriage above age 16, and that further shifts can occur only if a substantial proportion of women obtain secondary schooling. Delays in marriage above age 20 are related to the employment patterns of single women, which are largely determined by educational levels and economic opportunities. More importantly, changes in female education and labor force activities in modern occupations signal the emergence of new roles for single women.
Coale (1992) also emphasizes the centrality of women's status for the under-

standing of demographic behavior. Regions where first unions were delayed also led the introduction of marital fertility control, implying that early and late marriage patterns reflect different customs governing family formation. Societies with later patterns of union formation promote greater independence of young women and greater female autonomy, suggesting an environment favorable to deliberate fertility control. Societies with early patterns of union formation generally inhibit female autonomy and are less conducive to the introduction of fertility control.
In a review of the literature on women's autonomy and its effect on demographic behavior, K. O. Mason (1993) argues forcefully that greater female autonomy and independence lead to a postponement of union formation. A study by Safilios-Rothschild (reported in Mason, .1993) shows that the singulate mean age at marriage for women is higher in countries where women have higher access to resources, as measured by their economic activity, their schooling, or their mortality risks. For Latin America, studies also have shown significant differentials in the timing of first union for rural vs. urban residents, for women with different levels of education, and for those with different work experiences (Durch, 1980; ECLA, 1988; Ecla, 1993; Florez et al., 1990; Freitez and Romero, 1991). There is a strong consensus that rising educational levels and participation in modern labor force activities that compete with traditional gender roles should lead to a postponement of marriage.
In Latin America, patterns of social organization and female autonomy not only affect the timing of first union, but also the "choice" between a consensual or a

legal union. W. J. Goode (1960,1961) proposed an explanation of cohabitation in Caribbean societies that links the prevalence of consensual unions to the process of modernization and the destruction of local cultures through colonization and slavery. He claims that high illegitimacy rates resulted from the erosion of community social integration, especially from the impossibility of the community to punish "deviants" and to enforce the norm of legitimacy. Ignoring the teleological elements of his argument that specifies phases of assimilation into a common cultural pattern, Goode's account implies that consensual unions would be more prevalent among women from rural compared to urban backgrounds. As such, social background characteristics of women should be important predictors of their "choice" between consensual or legal unions.
A study by Charbit (reported in ECLA, 1993) shows that cultural and ethnic background also are important for understanding the prevalence of consensual unions in Latin American societies. However, Charbit maintains that the legacy from slavery does not adequately explain the prevalence of consensual unions in contemporary Latin America. Rather, he argues, the main factor behind informal unions in Latin America is poverty. Consensual unions among low socioeconomic status women are not a "choice," but a constraint imposed on them by their low levels of education and independence, and their low bargaining power relative to men. Accordingly, women's social status, as measured by family background and educational attainment, should be the key factor driving the "choice" between a legal or consensual union.
Although there have been few studies of Venezuelan nuptiality patterns, a re-

cent study by Freitez and Romero (1991) documented the wide differences in social background between women in consensual and legal unions. Consensual unions are consistently more prevalent among young women of rural origin, and with low levels of education. Consensual unions also tend to be more prevalent among women with higher years of work experience (Goldman, 1981). In the Latin American context, labor force participation is not necessarily a sign of greater female autonomy. Instead, it could well be the result of harsh economic conditions that force women out of the school system at young ages and into the labor market to help their families or parents. In fact, women of low socioeconomic origins exhibit high levels of labor force participation, particularly in low skill or domestic occupations.
Consensual unions in Latin America, particularly in the Caribbean and Central America, are a historical characteristic of the region. In that sense, these informal unions differ from the cohabitation found in more developed societies. Since the 1960's, Western countries have experienced significant changes in union formation patterns. The general tendency has been a movement toward later age at marriage and higher proportions remaining single (Axinn and Thorton, 1992; Westoff, 1986; Espenshade, 1985). At the same time, cohabitation has become more frequent among the young. This type of cohabitation has been associated with changing societal values during the "second demographic transition," from altruistic values concerned with family and offspring, to individualistic values that stress the rights and self-fulfillment of individuals (Van de Kaa, 1987). One of the most pervasive explanations for the

growth of informal unions in developed countries is the growing independence of women precipitated by increases in education, labor force participation, and female wages relative to men (Westoff, 1986). Different interpretations have been given to the rise in cohabitation in developed countries: deviant behavior, trial marriages, alternatives to marriage, or alternatives to being single (Rindfuss and VandenHeuvel, 1990; Manting, 1994; Thorton et al., 1995). Significantly, the rise of informal unions in developed societies is associated with lower fertility and higher instability than legal marriages and is especially prevalent among students.
Compared to other developing regions, and due to the character of the colonization and later re-population, Latin America exhibits patterns of demographic behavior that are both specific to the region and that can be considered as "culturally Western" (Goode, 1993). Thus, an increase in consensual unions in Venezuela, particularly at later ages, might signal the emergence of a different type of consensual union--one more similar to the type of consensual union characteristic of developed societies. We maintain that in contemporary Venezuela it is possible to distinguish between two types of cohabiting unions. One is the "traditional" type of consensual union which is associated with rural origins, low levels of education, low female independence, low male responsibilities, high fertility, and high instability. The second type is a more "modern" variant of consensual unions prevalent among more educated women from urban origins. This "modem" type of consensual union is an alternative to marriage among couples who enter into a consensual union as a trial phase before legal marriage, or those who choose cohabitation as an alternative to being single.

The prior discussion identified three conditions that signal the emergence of a new type of consensual union in contemporary Venezuela. First, higher shares of educated women will form consensual unions who in previous times presumably would have chosen a legal marriage. Second, because the new type of consensual union often involves lower interpersonal commitment, informal unions will be more unstable than either legal marriages or "traditional" consensual unions. Finally, because of their temporary character and instability, "modern" consensual unions will be associated with lower fertility relative to either "traditional" consensual unions or legal marriages. We examine these conditions below.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
CHANGES IN THE TIMING AND TYPE OF FIRST UNION: CARACAS, VENEZUELA
Apart from the World Fertility Survey in 1977, there are no surveys that record nuptiality by union type at the national level.2 Therefore, our analysis is based on the 1991 Longitudinal Fertility Survey conducted in Caracas and its surrounding semi-urban areas. The survey was designed around two cohorts of women who represent nuptiality behavior before and after the significant fertility decline that occurred between 1960 and 1990. The mature cohort, born between 1937-- 46, corresponds to women aged 45 to 54 in 1991 and represents the experience of
2Unfortunately, the 1993 Social Survey, that also collected data on first marriage, did not distinguish between consensual unions and legal marriages.

women who formed unions and bore children in the late 1950's and 1960's, when Venezuelan fertility was at peak levels. The young cohort, born between 196266, corresponds to women between ages 25 and 29 at the time of the survey and represents the nuptiality and fertility behavior of women after the demographic transition was well under way (Dyson and Murphy, 1985).
Identical questionnaires were administered to the two cohorts of women stratified by income levels in the capital city of Caracas and surrounding semi-urban areas settled by recent rural migration to the metropolis. The area under study corresponds to approximately one-quarter of the Venezuelan population in 1990. The surveys collected retrospective information on fertility behavior, nuptiality, education, residential mobility, and labor market participation, together with some family background characteristics, such as parents' education and rural or urban origin (see Freitez, et al., 1992). An important shortcoming in the data for the analysis of union formation is that, as in many other fertility surveys, women but not their partners were interviewed. Therefore, the influences of the husbands' characteristics on the decision to form a union are not considered.
Even though the surveys collected nuptiality histories, the information about legalization of consensual unions is puzzling. According to the data, only 2 per cent of consensual unions were later legalized--a very low proportion in the Latin American context. Camisa (1978) reports that around 30 per cent of legal unions in Panama in 1967 were preceded by consensual unions, compared to 15 per cent in Guatemala in 1957. A. Pebley and N. Goldman (1986) report that in sur-

veys conducted between 1969 and 1970, 22 per cent of consensual unions were legalized within 10 years of union formation in Mexico, 19 per cent in Colombia, 18 per cent in Costa Rica, and 35 per cent in Peru. Another study of Mexico using data for 1976-77 showed that 37 per cent of consensual unions were legalized after 10 years of cohabitation.
We could not find a study of union legalization in Venezuela to compare our results. The low proportion of legalization in our sample could well be the result of response errors. It is highly conceivable that unions begun as consensual unions and later legalized were reported as legal unions at time of the survey. But it is also possible that the rate of legalization of consensual unions in Venezuela is lower than in other Latin American countries. Generally in Latin America the prevalence of consensual unions tends to decrease for older women, owing in part to legalization of consensual unions. However, the percentage of consensual unions in Venezuela is stable across all ages (United Nations, 1990), which could signal a lower propensity to legalize consensual unions. For our purposes, and because the process of legalization of consensual unions is not one of our main objectives, we treated all unions as consensual that were later legalized as legal unions. This decision had no discernible effects on our results.
The 1991 Longitudinal Fertility Survey dates many life events by age, providing life-histories for several major life domains. The sample includes a total of 1,611 women, of which 684 belong to the mature cohort. Table 1presents the descriptive characteristics of the women in each cohort by age 25. The family-background characteristics are more or less similar for both

cohorts. Only mother's educational level differs across the two cohorts because a larger share of the younger cohort had mothers with completed primary or secondary education. Otherwise, the average woman in both cohorts had 8 siblings and a mother who formed a first union just over age 17. Furthermore, almost half of the respondents' mothers had rural origins. The similar family background characteristics indicate that Venezuela's major demographic and social changes occurred between the two cohorts under study.
In fact, the individual characteristics of the mature and young cohorts reveal several

significant differences. The mature cohort averaged approximately 5 years of formal schooling compared to 8 years for the young cohort, a statistically significant difference. Another significant difference is the percentage of women who ever worked by age 25:49 per cent for the mature cohort compared to 62 per cent for the younger cohort. However, there are no significant differences in the average number of years of work experience acquired between the two cohorts, which hovers around 3. The apparent contradiction between the higher proportion that ever worked among the younger cohort and the absence of sig-

nificant differences in the average number of years of work experience between the cohorts is explained by the fact that the younger cohort tends to participate in the labor market at a higher rate, but at later ages. The average age at first job for young women who ever worked was 19 compared to 17.5 for mature women. Furthermore, there was an intercohort change in the occupational distribution of the female workers. Specifically, women's representation in skilled occupations, i.e., professional and service jobs that require at least secondary education, rose significantly from 10 per cent among the older cohort to 25 per cent among the younger cohort. However, women's representation in unskilled occupations, i.e., manual and household activities, remained stable across cohorts, around 40 per cent.
Furthermore, the use of modern contraceptive methods significantly increased between cohorts. Only 16 per cent of the mature cohort reported ever using efficient contraceptives while over half of the young cohort did so. Over 40 per cent of the young cohort reported continuous urban residence compared to about one-third of mature women. Although similar proportions of mature and young women reported a premarital birth at the time of first union, we believe this figure is an underestimate of the prevalence of premarital births because our measure includes only those births that occurred in the year before marriage.
On balance, these comparisons reinforce our claim that the two cohorts were exposed to quite different social influences. The impact of these influences is clearly evident in the distinct patterns of union formation reported in Figure 1. The median age at first union (either consensual or legal) in Caracas increased more

that 1 year between cohorts, from less than 18 for the mature cohort to 19 for the younger cohort--a statistically significant difference (Tienda et al., 1995). The curve depicted by the cumulative proportion of women entering a first union also shows a tendency toward a lower prevalence of first union among the younger cohort. By age 29, 94 per cent of the mature cohort had already entered a first union, compared to 83 per cent for the younger cohort. Even though censoring of the young cohort conceals their marriage experience after age 30, the curve suggests an increase in the proportion of women remaining single. Results from fitting the Coale and McNeil (1972) nuptiality model reveal that the predicted proportion remaining single by age 45 for the young cohort was 10 per cent, relative to 3 per cent for the mature cohort (Tienda et al., 1995).
Age patterns of first union by legal status reveal additional differences. Delays in union formation between cohorts are evident for legal marriages, but not for consensual unions. By age 29, only 35 per cent of the young cohort was ever legally married compared to 50 per cent among mature women. On the other hand, the rate of entering consensual unions does not differ between cohorts, at least during the early ages, when the curves almost perfectly overlap. Up to age 20, the cumulative proportion of women entering a consensual union is virtually identical for both cohorts--around 35 per cent. After age 20, the prevalence of consensual unions is higher for the younger relative to the mature cohort. The curves for both cohorts cross, and by age 29,47 per cent of women in the younger cohort had entered a consensual union, compared to 43 per cent of mature women.

FIG. I.--Cumulative proportion of women in first union by union type and cohort.

As an indicator of the prevalence of each type of union within the same cohort, we also computed the ratio of the proportion married relative to the proportion in consensual unions (not reported). Forthe mature cohort the ratio shows that under age 20, the prevalence of consensual unions is higher relative to legal unions; by age20 the share of women legallymarried and in consensual unions are the same, and after age 20, the proportion of legal unions exceeds the proportion of consensual unions. For the younger cohort, the prevalence of consensual unions is always higher relative to legal unions, and there is no sign of convergence. More-

over, it appears that after age 20, the ratio of legal to consensual unions is more or less steady--around 70 legal marriages per 100 consensual unions.
In short, the ratio of legal to consensual unions reveals that for the mature cohort, entering into a first union after age 20 implied that unions were most likely to be legal, which is not true for the younger cohort. Of the 23 per cent of mature women who entered a first union between age20 to 29, 34 per cent entered a consensual union and 66 per cent entered a legalmarriage. Among younger women, of the 22 per cent who formed a union during their twenties, 52 per cent entered a consensual

union and 48 per cent entered a legal marriage.
Our description of first union formation has identified the major processes that will be considered in the analysis of changes in first unions by Venezuelan women. First, we will identify the mechanisms behind the overall delay in first union formation, whether legal or consensual. Second, because the formation of legal and consensual unions appear to represent two distinctive processes, we will identify the factors that influence the "choice" between one type of union or the other. Third, we will try to explain the rise of consensual unions for the younger cohort, particularly after age 20.
To address these questions, we implement a statistical analysis that allows us to identify the mechanisms influencing the timing and probability of first union formation, on the one hand, and the mechanisms that undergird the "choice" between a consensual or a legal first union, on the other. Discrete-time logit methods for the study of event histories are used to predict the risk of entering into a first union (Allison, 1982; Yamaguchi, 1991). However, we are also interested in understanding what factors influence the type of union formed. Because consensual and legal unions are mutually exclusive, the risks of entering one or the other compete. Together with discrete-time models to estimate the risk of first union formation, we specify a competing-risk model that estimates the type-specific risks of entering a legal or a consensual first union (Allison, 1984; Hachen, 1988; Liefbroer, 1991; Manting, 1994; Greene and Rao, 1995).
Competing-risk models generally require the estimation of two separate discrete-time logit models predicting the occurrence of a particular type of event,

treating the occurrence of the other event as censored. An alternative is to estimate a multinomial discrete-time logit model with different outcomes. The two methods yielded similar results. The multinomial competing-risks approach allowed us to estimate simultaneously the risks of entering either into a legal or consensual union relative to the risk of remaining single and to compare the risks of forming different types of union (Steel et al., 1996).

TION IN CARACAS, VENEZUELA
The empirical analysis concentrates first on the process of union formation in general, and subsequently on the "choice" between a consensual or legal union. We propose a model of union formation and "choice" between consensual or legal unions that includes indicators of modernization and female social roles, incorporating both family background and individual characteristics. Table 2 shows the variables included in the analysis and their predicted influence on the risk of union formation in general, and on marriage versus cohabitation, in particular. Because the "choice" between marriage or consensual union may be differently related to the independent variables, the second column indicates whether the direction of the effect is expected to be the same or not.
Being part of the young cohort measures secular changes between generations exposed to different influences, life experiences, and opportunities (Ryder, 1965). Following the changes in union formation and cohort differences described above, for the younger cohort we expect a lower risk of entering a marriage, but a higher risk of forming a consensual union.

ity should exert a positive effect on all the dependent variables because larger families may precipitate daughter's early entry into union as a way of gaining autonomy, or because early entry into union constitutes a household mechanism to relieve population pressure within the family (Parish and Willis, 1993).
Several personal characteristics that vary over time are measured up to the year before entering a union, including all age periods prior to first union and after age 11. The schooling measures include both years of education completed and enrollment sta-

tus, which exert different effects on nuptiality. Years of education will decrease the risk of entering a union and forming a consensual union because early ages at union formation and high prevalence of cohabitation is expected among women with low educational levels. On the other hand, higher levels of education will increase the risk of forming a legal union. School enrollment, especially secondary school enrollment, should lower the risk of union formation.
Work experience and current employment status do not generate clear predictions based on theory and the Latin American experience. Most studies in other developing regions show that higher female labor force participation delays marriage, but the effect depends on the type of work performed. If economic independence is a constraint on union formation, greater work experience may imply better economic conditions which accelerate union formation. Also, in Latin American societies, work experience tends to be higher among women with low socioeconomic backgrounds, particularly in activities that do not conflict with domestic roles.
To capture the possibly different effect of various kinds of occupations, we distinguish between work experience in skilled and unskilled occupations. The direction of the effect on union formation, marriage, and cohabitation of years of work experience in skilled occupations is indeterminate. Work experience in skilled occupations can either conflict with traditional familial roles and thus delay union formation, or it can facilitate entering a union by eliminating economic constraints if women continue working after entering a union. Based on the Latin American experience of higher prevalence of consensual unions among women with greater work experiences,

we predict that experience in unskilled occupations will increase the risk of union entry at any age, and a consensual union in particular. Current work status, either in skilled or unskilled occupations, is associated more clearly with the presence of an immediate role conflict between work and family and hence could lower the risk of being in union, whether legal or consensual.
Prior studies indicate that relative to rural dwellers, urban residents delay union formation and that consensual unions will be less common. A pre-marital birth should increase the risks of entering any kind of union, legal or consensual. To the extent that a premarital birth is the expression of union stability and commitment, it could precipitate a decision that couples would have taken anyhow.
An interaction term between young cohort membership and years of education permits a test for the presence of the two different types of consensual unions--the "traditional" and the "modern"--as described above.4 The interaction term is expected to have a negative effect on the likelihood of union formation and marriage because the risk of union formation among the younger cohort will decrease with higher educational levels. Furthermore, if consensual unions among young, more educated women represent a "modern" union variant, the interaction effect should
4Due to the handful of women in the older cohort with secondary schooling or beyond, we were unable to treat education as a categorical variable. Specifically, the competing-risks multinomial logit model could not be estimated since no mature women with more than secondary education ever entered a consensual union.

increase the risk of forming a consensual union because the effect of years of education on the likelihood of entering a consensual union should be different across cohorts. A positive interaction effect would signal that as years of education increase women in the younger cohort are more likely to form consensual unions than their mature counterparts.
RESULTS
Table 3 presents the estimates from the discrete-time logit model predicting the risk of union formation and the competingrisks multinomial logit model predicting the specific risks of forming a legal or a consensual union.
As expected, the main determinants of delayed union formation are birth cohort, mother's educational background, and school enrollment status. In particular, being enrolled in school, either secondary or higher education, significantly reduces the risk of entering a union at every age. Controlling for other variables, women who were enrolled in school were half as likely (exp [-0.631] = 0.53, exp [-0.559] = 0.57) to have entered a union at any age than women who were not attending school. The second largest negative effect on the risk of union formation corresponds to respondents' mothers' educational background. The point estimates indicate that at every age, women whose mothers completed at least primary education were 0.84 (exp [-0.168]) times as likely than women whose mothers had no formal schooling to form a union at every age. Daughters whose mothers completed secondary school were 0.68 (exp [-0.393]) times as likely to enter a union at each age relative

to women whose mothers had no formal education.5 Finally, women in the younger cohort were 0.74 (exp [--0.306]) times as likely to enter a union relative to women in the older cohort.
Several circumstances increase the risk of entering a union at every age, including rural origins, number of siblings, and premarital births. The strongest effect corresponds to non-marital childbearing. Women who bore a child out of wedlock were 2.5 (exp. [0.918]) times as likely to enter a union at every age compared to otherwise similar women who were childless. The odds of first union formation for women whose mother had a rural background were 1.2 (exp. [0.168]) times those of women whose mothers had an urban origin. Finally, the larger the sibship size, the higher the risk of union formation at every age, reflecting the predisposition toward marriage arising either from socialization in a large family or the household strategy of early marriage to reduce population pressure within the family.
The empirical results predicting the risk of first union formation among Venezuelan women largely confirms expectations based on the theoretical arguments, but also highlights relationships that deserve a closer scrutiny. On the one hand, the timing of first unions is strongly influenced by
5The effect of respondent's education on the probability of first union is captured by the coefficients for mother's education. A model including only personal characteristics showed the effect of education to be negative and significant. The correlation between family background and personal characteristics did not significantly affect the estimation of the multinomial discretetime models predicting the "choice" of union type. However, to avoid collinearity problems, in testing for the interaction between cohort and years of education we include only personal characteristics.

family background characteristics, especially rural origin and mothers' educational attainment, as well as by theroles women occupy before and after entering a union. However, these roles arenotdefined solely by women's individual char-

acteristics. Role definition derives both from individual aspirations and opportunities, and from traditional patterns of behavior transmitted through family background and socialization experiences.

16

Thus, social and economic changes associated with modernization may not immediately change behavior patterns because traditional roles and customs may attenuate their effects. Yet, the individual characteristics signal possible role conflict between traditional maternal and spousal roles on the one hand, and aspirations consistent with greater personal autonomy, on the other. This is especially apparent for women who are enrolled in school. The effect of education on first union delay is very clear among enrolled women. However, female labor force participation does not exert its predicted effect. This apparent anomaly reflects the character of the female labor market in less developed societies. Higher work experience often reflects a response to an economic need at very young ages of a woman's life cycle and is associated with low socioeconomic status. Furthermore, the occupational and professional opportunities for women in less developed societies are not sufficient to create a role conflict between family formation and market activity.
Table 3 also shows the estimates from the competing-risks multinomial logit model predicting the likelihood of entering either a formal or a consensual union versus remaining single. Consistent with predictions based on the trends in union formation in Venezuela (Figure 1), younger women have a lower risk of forming a legal union, but a higher risk of forming a consensual union than mature women. Mothers' educational characteristics are strong predictors of their daughter's nuptiality behavior: higher levels of mother's education significantly reduce the risk of forming a consensual union. Mother's rural origin also significantly increases the likelihood that daughters will form a consensual union, but does not influence the odds of legal

union formation, which appears to be mostly the result of her individual characteristics.
Family size increases the risk of forming a legal marriage, but has no effect on the risk of forming a consensual union. The meaning of the different effects depend on the characteristics associated with a larger family. Being reared in a larger family often involves stronger social control over female members and these circumstances are conducive to the enforcement of legal marriages. It is also possible that the different effects of family size on union type reflect an unobserved association between larger families and stronger religious beliefs. If so, the religious beliefs behind larger families could drive the choice of a legal instead of a consensual union.
Work experience in unskilled occupations significantly influences the risk of forming a consensual union. As discussed before, and consistent with the Latin American evidence, each year of work experience in unskilled occupations increases the risk of entering a consensual union (exp [0.063] = 1.08). Current employment status is unrelated to the decision to enter a consensual or legal union, but having resided permanently in Caracas lowers the risk of cohabitation. Specifically, women who always resided in Caracas were 0.59 (exp [-0.515]) times as likely to enter a consensual union as migrant women. Finally, a premarital birth increases the risk of entering a consensual union, but has no effect on the risk of entering a legal union. This finding reflects the fact that premarital childbearing is more prevalent among the lower strata, where cohabitation is typical.
Respondents educational characteristics show clearly opposing effects on the

risk of entering marriage and the risk of entering a consensual union. After controlling for school enrollment, higher levels of education inhibit the formation of consensual unions. On the other hand, higher levels of education increase the risk of entering a legal union at every age. Being in school has comparable effects on both union outcomes. Women enrolled in school were less likely to enter any kind of union than their non-enrolled counterparts. In sum, being part of the younger cohort and being enrolled in secondary school reduce the risk of forming a legal marriage, but higher levels of education and urban residence increase that risk.
The positive effect of young cohort membership on the risk of forming a consensual union deserves closer examination. A higher risk of forming consensual unions among the young cohort runs counter to the prediction that the prevalence of consensual unions will fall with improvements in women's social status, unless there has been some changes in the composition of consensual unions in Venezuela. We postulated that the increase in consensual unions above age 20 could involve members of the younger cohort who in the older cohort would have chosen a legal marriage.
Table 4 presents the marital "choices" of single women between ages 20 to 25 by cohort and educational level. To capture the different nuptiality behavior for different educational levels within cohorts, we distinguished between women whose educational attainment was onehalf standard deviation above or below the cohort mean. In the mature and younger cohort, respectively, this number included women with less or more than 7 and 10 years of education. Among

women with lower education, the significant reduction in the proportion entering a formal marriage is proportionately distributed between choices of remaining single or entering a consensual union. On the other hand, for women with higher educational levels, the proportion remaining single increased from 25 per cent in the mature cohort to 48 per cent in the younger cohort. The proportions of women who married fell from 63 per cent to 31 per cent across cohorts. Finally, consistent with our hypothesis, there is a significant increase in the proportion of highly educated women ages 20 to 25 who chose a consensual union as their first type of union between ages 20 to 25. Concretely, 21 per cent of women with higher levels of education entered a consensual union, versus 12 per cent among the mature cohort.
To ascertain whether these results held up in a multivariate context, we estimated the previous models of union formation and choice of union type including only personal characteristics as predictors and adding an interaction term between cohort and years of education. Descriptive tabulations reported in Table 4 imply a negative influence of the interaction term on the risks of forming a union and entering marriage and a positive effect on the risk of entering a consensual union. Table 5, which presents the results from this estimation, confirms that membership in the younger cohort and higher educational levels reduces the risk of entering any kind of union. The competing-risks model shows that years of education increases the risk of entering a legal union and that the effect of the interaction term on the risk of marriage is, as expected, negative, but only marginally significant 0=0.099). On the other hand, the effect

of the interaction term on the risk of entering a consensual union reveals that even though the main effect of education reduces the likelihood of entering into consensual unions, among the younger cohort the effect is less negative. Thus, for young women, higher levels of education increase the likelihood of entering a consensual union relative to their mature counterparts. These results are consistent with the proposition that, among the younger cohort, consensual unions constitute an alternative choice for women with higher levels of education.
Results presented thus far also have shown that school enrollment is the main factor behind the delay in the timing of first unions for Venezuelan women. Higher levels of education also delay the entrance into union and increase the proportions remaining single, particularly among the younger cohort. Labor force participation did not affect the timing of union formation. The "choice" between a consensual or legal first union appears to be a highly structured decision that depends on family background and women's roles before marriage. Decisions to enter a consensual or legal union are two distinct, albeit re-

lated, processes influenced by women's social position as measured by family background, educational attainment, and labor force participation. The persistence of "traditional" forms of consensual unions across cohorts results from the modest improvements in the social position of women with low socioeconomic origins. "Traditional" consensual unions are still prevalent among women with rural backgrounds, low educational levels, and greater amounts of accumulated work experience in unskilled occupations.
Increased cohabitation among the younger cohort, particularly above age 20, seems to be the result of more educated women also choosing cohabitation as their first type of union. On balance, our results suggest that in addition to "traditional" consensual unions, a "modern" cohabitation has emerged in contemporary Caracas. To the extent that consensual unions involving highly educated women represent a different type of union, they should more closely resemble the pattern of cohabitation common in more developed societies than the pattern of "traditional" consensual unions in Latin America. Thus, they should be associated with

dissolution and fertility rates by cohorts for legal and consensual unions in Caracas. To capture thepresence of different typesof unions, wealso distinguish between women whose educational attainment falls above or below the cohort-specific mean by one-half a standard deviation, i.e.,years of education over and under 7 or 10years for the mature · and young cohort, respectively.
Considering changes in dissolution rates among women with lower educational levels, Table 6 shows an increase in the proportion of marriages dissolved within 10 years in union by cohort. The cumulative probability of dissolution of first marriages rose from 9.5 per cent

among the older cohort to 17 per cent among the younger cohort. However, the probability of consensual union dissolution fell from 42 per cent for the oldercohort to 30 per cent for theyounger cohort. Thus, to the extent that consensual unions among women with lower educational levels represent the "traditional" type of consensual unions, Table 6 shows that they have become somewhat more stable among the younger cohort relative to the mature cohort. Still, among women with lower levels of education, the dissolution rates for cohabiting unions are much higher than the dissolution rates for legal marriages.

As we predicted, the probability of dissolution among legal marriages increased from 7 per cent among the older cohort to 28 per cent among the younger cohort. This change is more pronounced than the rise in dissolution rates for legal marriages among women with lower educational levels. The increased instability of legal unions has been postulated as an important causal mechanism behind the rise of cohabitation in more developed societies (Westoff, 1986). A similar tendency toward higher marital instability is registered in Caracas, particularly among highly educated women, and could be one of the factors affecting the growth of the new type of consensual unions among younger women.
Among women with higher educational levels, the cumulative probability of consensual unions increased from 9 per cent to 35 per cent across cohorts. The probability of dissolution of consensual unions in the younger cohort is higher among women with higher levels of education compared to women with lower levels of education. To the extent that cohabitation among highly educated women from the younger cohort represents a "modern" type of consensual union, they show higher instability than the "traditional" form of cohabitation in the younger cohort.
The cumulative duration-specific fertility rates among women with lower levels of education show that after 10 years in union, the fertility rate of consensual unions is higher than the fertility rate for legal marriages, particularly among the

younger cohort. Table 6 also shows that after 10 years in union, the decline in fertility rates among women with lower educational levels has been relatively small, from around 3 children per woman in the older cohort to 2.5 children per woman in the younger cohort. The decline in fertility rates has been more pronounced among women with higher educational levels. The fertility behavior of mature women with higher levels of education was very similar to that of their less educated cohort counterparts, but among the young cohort, highly educated women have much lower fertility than their less educated counterparts. Highly educated women in the younger cohort averaged 1.2 and 1.3 children per woman after 10 years in legal or informal unions respectively, much lower than the 2.3 and 2.7 children for women with lower levels of education. Thus, to the extent that highly educated women in consensual unions represent the "modern" type of cohabitation, as we predicted, they bear fewer children than cohabiting women with lower levels of education.
Another aspect of fertility behavior that distinguishes cohabitation among women with higher educational levels from those in legal or "traditional" consensual unions is the probability of ever having a child. Whereas in all the other types of union the proportion ever having a child is almost universal--around 90 per cent--one-third of highly educated cohabiting women in the younger cohort remained childless after 10 years in union.
Recognition of the presence of a new type of consensual union among young women in Caracas has important implications for fertility. This "modern" form of cohabitation experiences higher dissolution rates and lower probability of having

a first child than "traditional" consensual unions with a negative aggregate effect on fertility. The emergence of this new type of union should increase the influence of changes in nuptiality on Venezuelan fertility decline. This "modern" union implies that, unlike educated women from the mature cohort who would have entered a legal union to begin their reproductive career, young, more educated women initiate unions on a trial basis. Because these unions assume the form of a trial phase before marriage or an alternative to singlehood, they are highly unstable and do not translate into immediate childbearing. These two factors--lower exposure to the risk of childbearing due to higher dissolution rates and later timing of first birth within "modern" cohabiting unions--are important proximate mechanisms through which nuptiality patterns affect fertility outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS
The analysis of changes in women's social status and its effect on the timing and "choice" of first unions in Venezuela has produced novel insights about the mechanisms driving nuptiality change and the links between marriage and fertility behavior. On the one hand, the extension of years of schooling among women is the main factor delaying union formation in contemporary Caracas. In particular, school enrollment status seems to be incompatible with the roles of mother and wife. Once schooling is completed, higher levels of education increase the probability of remaining single among younger women. Paradoxically, years of work experience, specifically in unskilled occupations tends to increase the likelihood of entering a union. This finding reflects the

character of female labor force participation in Latin America. There is a polarization between women who work because of economic necessity early in their life, and women who do not enter the labor market. This pattern appears to be changing somewhat among younger cohorts, where the rate of labor force participation in skilled occupations has increased. Nevertheless, changing patterns of female labor force participation were not important enough to affect union formation significantly.
On the other hand, by distinguishing first union formation by union type, we showed that the considerable delays in the timing of first union are mostly explained by changes in legal union formation. The rate of entering a consensual union remained the same up to age 20 for the cohort of women born before and the cohort born after Venezuela's fertility transition. However, after age 20 the rate of entry into consensual unions increased among women in the younger cohort relative to the older cohort.
The "choice" between a formal or consensual union appears to be a highly structured decision that depends not only on women's individual characteristics, but also on her family background, which in turn reflects her socialization process. Low levels of education in the family and rural origins are very strong predictors of consensual union formation. Educational attainment, especially beyond secondary schooling, may reverse that structural relationship because women with higher educational levels tend to prefer legal marriages over cohabitation. However, improvements in the social status of women from low socioeconomic background have been slow, nuptiality change has not been very pronounced, and consensual unions remain their prevalent type of first union.
