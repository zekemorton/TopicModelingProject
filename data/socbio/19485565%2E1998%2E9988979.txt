ABSTRACT: Information on abortion is limited and inaccurate, especially in the developing world, which has led to speculation on the prevalence of abortion in these regions. A rise in prevalence of abortion is mostly counted in terms of increase in the prevalence of induced abortions which reflects on the reproductive health of women. With the growing concern for the reproductive health of women, the study of abortion has drawn the attention of researchers worldwide. This paper is an attempt to assess the induced abortion potential among Indian women by utilizing information on proportion of unwanted and ill-timed pregnancies obtained through National Family Health Survey, India. This exercise may facilitate a better understanding of the exact prevalence of induced abortion, which necessarily should be less than the estimated potential depending on the levels of unwanted and ill-timed fertility.

The demographic implications of induced abortions have been studied to facilitate an understanding of their effect on fertility and population growth. Family-planning program managers have used induced abortion rates to gauge the need for contraceptive services. However, the public health implications of induced abortions have only recently gained the attention of policy makers. Abortions in clandestine or otherwise unsafe conditions expose women to risk of mortality and morbidity (Khanna et al., 1994). When access to safe abortion services is limited, abortion complications account for a significant proportion of admissions into gynecological wards (Mpangile et al., 1993). Research on induced abortions has revived in the wake of this and other evidence indicating that induced abortions have been a major cause of maternal deaths in the developing world, with abortion-related complications accounting for nearly half of all maternal deaths (Dixon-Muller, 1990; Royston and Armstrong, 1989; Royston, 1991).

In most developing countries, the characteristics of women resorting to abortion or its consequences to their health remain unknown. Information collected in this context from surveys are said to be incomplete, despite the simplicity in defining an induced abortion, mostly because women do not tend to report induced abortions. If an abortion is reported at all, it is more likely to be categorized as a spontaneous abortion rather than as an induced one. This effect has been noticed in several surveys world-wide (WHO, 1978).
The National Family Health Survey, 1992, conducted in 25 states in India collected information on the characteristics of women who ever experienced an abortion according to type (spontaneous and induced) and the "wanted" nature and timing of the pregnancies. This survey provides a unique opportunity to assess indirectly the potential for induced abortion among Indian women. This information has been used earlier to measure in-

directly the prevalence of induced abortions (Huntington et al., 1996).
The role of family planning programs in India has been transformed by shifting from being merely one providing contraceptives to one which is more integrated, including providing safe abortion services and helping couples restrict ill-timed and unwanted pregnancies, thereby controlling levels of maternal mortality. Ever since induced abortions were legalized with minimal restrictions by the Medical Termination of Pregnancy act, 1971 (Sarkar, 1977), the number of centers offering MTP services has been increasing over the years (Govt. of India, 1994).
While induced abortion has been an important factor responsible for fertility decline in industrialized countries, it does not seem to have made a significant contribution toward fertility decline in India. However, in the Indian context, the potential for induced abortions should not be judged from the perspective of fertility decline, but rather from the dynamics of contraceptive acceptance.
It is evident that for a substantial proportion of couples in India, sterilization is the first ever-used method of contraception (UPS, 1995). Such couples may have felt a need to limit their family sizes much earlier in the family building process or even to adjust the timing of the births, which may have resulted in the use of induced abortions. Contraceptive failure also contributes to the use of induced abortion. There is evidence to suggest that increases in contraceptive use go hand in hand with increases in induced abortion, indicating the contribution of possible contraceptive failures.
Estimates on the prevalence of abortions (both induced and spontaneous) have been scarce. Given the fact that gov-

ernment records do not cover the phenomenon exhaustively, there is a need for alternative estimates to gauge its prevalence. The trivial proportion of abortions (spontaneous and induced) reported in surveys clearly indicates a large extent of under-reporting with respect to induced abortion (Barreto et al., 1992; Casterline, 1989; Jones and Forrest, 1992).
Induced abortions may be reported as spontaneous abortions in order to avoid admitting morally unacceptable actions. Illegal abortions of a premarital and sex-selective nature are carried out in the private sector and never enter the record. Therefore, the abortion phenomenon in India is largely disguised due to incomplete and limited data availability. India's actual abortion rate is probably about two to five times the reported rate of 3 abortions per 1,000 women, since only a fraction of the abortions, that is, those performed in registered nursing homes and government facilities, are reported (Henshew, 1990). A large proportion of the abortions that go unreported may have been performed without any medical supervision, thus increasing the risk of secondary infections/complications for the women undergoing such procedures.
The National Family Health Survey (NFHS) (UPS, 1995) indicates a very low prevalence of abortion among Indian women. The percentage of pregnancies reported as aborted varies between 3.7 per cent in Madhya Pradesh to 10.3 per cent in Tamil Nadu. Using these proportions of pregnancy wastage and Crude Birth Rates (CBR's), we can make a simple estimate of abortion per thousand live births that varies between 36.4 in Andhra Pradesh to 131.4 in Tamil Nadu. Based on this number of reported abortions, the consequent influence of abortion on fertility is bound to be meager.

ABORTION IN INDIA: AN OVERVIEW
Official estimates of the annual incidence of induced abortion are limited to the statistics provided by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, which accounts for the reported MTP cases performed in the government's recognized clinics. However, several unofficial estimates of induced abortion in India indicate an increasing trend from 3.9 million in 1966 (Shah Committee) to 6.7 million by Chhabra et al. (1994).
These estimates are based on a varied set of assumptions. For instance, the Shah Committee assumed 73 live births, 2 stillbirths, and 25 abortions (15 induced and 10 spontaneous) per every 100 pregnancies. With similar assumptions, the recent estimate by Chhabra et al. (1994) finds 6.7 million induced and 4.5 million spontaneous abortions. Further, IPPF (1970) estimates of 6.5 million illegal abortions in India is based on an abortion ratio of 200:1000 known pregnancies which results in an abortion rate of about 55:1000 for women aged 1 5 ^ 4 years. Besides, other individual estimates by Karkal (1991) indicate 3 illegal abortions per one legal abortion and 4-5 illegal abortions for every MTP in urban areas.
With several estimates at hand, it is difficult to assess the exact prevalence of induced abortions. It may be worthwhile at this juncture to have an assessment of the potential for induced abortion among Indian women, as an alternative to the existing guesstimates, which are based on varied sets of assumptions.
As the prevalence of abortion increases, induced abortion takes up a larger share of total abortions. Spontaneous abortions are more often associated with biological char-

acteristics of women (Nortman, 1974; WHO, 1970). Nulliparous women, women getting pregnant in the high-risk age categories (less than 20 years and above 35 years of age), multiparous women and women with shorter birth intervals are prone to spontaneous abortions (Awan, 1975). In general, there is a biological limit on the proportion of spontaneous abortions in any population, which can at best account for a limited and more or less constant proportion of pregnancies (Bongaart and Potter, 1983). In a low fertility situation, with better access to maternal care, the incidence of spontaneous abortions would be low. Even in a high fertility situation, it can not account for a significant proportion of total abortions. Increases, if any, in the abortion rate would always be due to induced abortions.
The potential for induced abortion rises mainly due to unintended pregnancies. Couples may exceed their desired number of children either due to non-contraceptive reasons or due to non-use of contraception. Alternatively, couples who desire additional children may be faced with an ill-timed pregnancy. Thus, on the whole, both ill-timed and unwanted pregnancies run the risk of being the potential cases for induced abortions.
It should be kept in mind that the reporting of ill-timed and unwanted births are subject to some biases. A birth may be reported as ill-timed depending on the possible adverse situation prevailing in the household at the time of the birth. A birth could become unwanted by not being of the desired sex. Not all unwanted and ill-timed births are due to contraceptive failure or an unmet need for effective contraception. On the other hand, the wrong timing of a desired pregnancy might result in an induced abortion. This

is not to say that all unintended pregnancies result in induced abortions, but rather that they have a fair chance of being aborted voluntarily. The reporting of illtimed and unwanted pregnancies has a strong association with the likelihood of abortion. In fact, the phenomenon of illtimed/unwanted pregnancy was used as a filter question to identify the incidence of induced abortion accurately (Huntington et al., 1996).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
ASSESSING INDUCED ABORTION POTENTIAL BASED ON INFORMATION ON ILLTIMED AND UNWANTED PREGNANCIES
Using the information on the per cent of pregnancies that resulted in live births by age and the age-specific fertility rates (ASFR's), we derived age-specific pregnancy rates (ASPR's) for the 15 major states in India. These ASFR's and the proportion of pregnancies resulting in live births are presented in Table 1. The resultant ASPR's are products of the agespecific fertility rates and the reciprocal of the per cent of the pregnancies resulting in live births (Table 2). The ASPR's can be understood as the number of women out of a group of 1,000 in that age category who will conceive in that year, a definition similar to that given for ASFR's.
Thus,
ASPR; = ASFR,. * (1/PLB;)
where, ASPR's are the age-specific pregnancy rate for age /, ASFR is the age-specific fertility rate, and PLB; is the percentage of live births to total pregnancies in the ¿-th age category.

Out of the number of women who are likely to be pregnant, only those women with pregnancies that were ill-timed and unwanted have the potential to be aborted, and those proportions are given in Table 3. The number of women who run this risk of being potential abortees over the quinquenial age groups can be measured as the product of the ASPR's and the proportion of women having ill-timed and unwanted pregnancies in that age category. The sum of these age-specific potential induced abortion rates (ASPIAR) over the five-year age groups multiplied by 5 gives the total potential induced abortion rate (TPIAR). The computation of TPIAR is similar to the computation of the TFR; but instead of the ASFR's used for TFR, we used ASPIAR's.
ASPIAR,. = ASPR; * PWIUP,.
where ASPIAR, is the age-specific potential induced abortion rate for age "/"; ASPR(- is the age-specific pregnancy rate, and PWIUP(- is the proportion of women having ill-timed or unwanted pregnancies in the age group "/," and hence,
TPIAR = 5 2 , ASPIAR,.
The ASPIAR's and the associated TPIAR's for the 15 major states are given in Table 4. This TPIAR can be explained in terms of average expected potential number of induced abortion per women under the given schedule of fertility and age pattern of ill-timed and unwanted pregnancies.
Using these estimates of abortion potential per women in reproductive ages, we also computed the potentials for induced abortion for pregnancies which is given in Table 6. These potential induced

abortion rates indicate the potential per pregnancy in every age category over the reproductive ages.
In an attempt to find alternative means of obtaining information about induced abortions when reported data is inadequate, researchers have used filter questions followed by more specific nonstigmatizing questions to elicit data on induced abortions (Anderson et al., 1994; Huntington et al., 1993). The Huntington

et al. (1993) study used the "unwanted status" of any previous pregnancy to dwell upon the issues of induced abortion. About 65 per cent of women who had an unwanted pregnancy tried to or obtained an induced abortion.
An evaluation of similar studies using Demographic Health Survey (DHS) data on induced abortion and alternative questions to obtain information from the DHS concluded that abortions are more likely

to be reported in studies of MCH-FP clients, orin studies that take place in settings where abortion is legal. In systems with high reported levels of unwanted pregnancy, there were also higher reported levels of abortions. If the questions

about unwanted pregnancies did notgenerate responses, then induced abortions remained unreported (Huntington et al., 1996). Given this finding, it is expected that a majority of women saying that they had an unwanted pregnancy arelikely to seek an induced abortion in regimes that are not restrictive. Medical Termination of pregnancies (MTP's) have been available to Indian women since 1972, and quite a few women are aware ofit. It can besaid, therefore, that the per cent ofunwanted or ill-timed pregnancies would be indicative of the potential for induced abortions.
We have made anattempt toobtain the number ofinduced abortions ineach state, using the ASPIAR's and the projected female population in thereproductive ages. The age-sex specific data on India's population for the 1991 census is not available. Hence, projected figures for the number of females in the reproductive ages (15^9) were used to estimate thepotential for induced abortions in 1992-93. This figure is obtained for each state as

the sum of the product of the projected female population and the ASPIAR for each age category. It should be remembered that this is simply an exercise to indicate the possible number of induced abortions. We can not lay claim to any degree of accuracy.
The potential abortion in a particular year, say "t" will be:
A, = ASPIAR,., * W;,
where ASPIART = age-specific potential induced abortion rate for i-th age group in the year / and Wf/ is the number of women in i-th age group in year "i."
The Huntington et al. (1996) study found that when the reported levels of unwanted pregnancies were high, and the atmosphere around induced abortions was restrictive, as in Egypt, Ghana, and Cote d'Ivoire, then 25, 55, and 65 per cent of the women, respectively, who reported unwanted pregnancies attempted an abortion.

In India, abortions have been legally available since 1972. It can be assumed that except for some segments of the population the atmosphere regarding abortion is not too restrictive. It can therefore be assumed that at least a third of those women who had an unwanted/ill-timed pregnancy in India would attempt an abortion, based on the observation made by Huntington et al. (1996). Even at the modest level of conversion of unwanted pregnancies to induced abortions, the estimated number of abortions far exceed the reported number (see Table 7).
DISCUSSION
The number of births reported as illtimed and unwanted has been used to compute potential abortion rates by age for the fifteen major states in India. Usually there is a reluctance on the part of women to report a birth that has already occurred as unwanted. Therefore, the per-

centage of such births stated as ill-timed and unwanted are likely to be underestimates, and the rates for potential abortion will be affected accordingly. The distribution of ill-timed and unwanted births indicates that unwanted births occur mostly for women above 30 years of age, and illtimed births are concentrated more among younger women (UPS, 1995). With advancing age, women will achieve their desired family size and composition, while younger women are expected to have illtimed pregnancies. This finding is in keeping with the age characteristics of couples with unmet need for contraception. As can be seen from Table 2, the proportion of ill-timed births ranges from 5.7 per cent in Gujarat to 26.9 per cent in Karnataka, while the proportions of unwanted births are much lower, ranging between 2.4 in Kerala and 15.3 in West Bengal. Further, as the total demand for family planning in the spacing category remains largely unmet, it is likely that this unmet demand for spacing results in potential candidates for induced abortion.
The total potential for abortion is the highest in Uttar Pradesh and the lowest in Gujarat. The peak ages in abortion potential are achieved at the same time as the peak in ASFR, i.e., in 20-24 age group in 10 out of 14 major states. For Assam, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, and Uttar Pradesh, this peak is achieved in the age group 25-29. It can be seen that this potential abortion rate is a reflection of the fertility levels and the level of unmet demand for spacing and limiting services. The rate is high in states like Uttar Pradesh, which have the combination of a high level of fertility and a high level of unmet demand for family planning. The rate is low in states like Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Gujarat, and Kerala which represent a combination of

relatively lower fertility levels and lower levels of unmet demand, especially for limiting services (see Table 5). It can also be seen that the potential abortion rate is high in states like West Bengal where the met demand for spacing is relatively high and the fertility level is also relatively high. Thus, it can be said that the TPIAR depends extensively on the unmet demand for limiting, clearly indicating that the potential for abortion is high when the demand for limiting services remains largely unmet. This finding is further confirmed by obtaining correlation between the TPIAR and the per cent of couples satisfied with spacing and limiting services, which was -0.0475 and -0.6826, respectively.
While the probability of a pregnancy having the potential for induced abortion is relatively high in the three diverse states of West Bengal, Assam, and Karnataka and the lowest in Rajasthan and Gujarat, this probability increases with age for all the states except for Kerala and Maharashtra where it assumes an inverted V-shape. In spite of the fact that there is a larger percentage of couples with unmet need for spacing than limiting, the TPIAR's and the potential for induced abortion per pregnancy are heavily influenced by the percentage of couples whose need for limiting services has been met. There is a clear negative relationship between these two, indicating that the potential for induced abortion is higher if the percentage of couples whose need for limiting services being met is low. It can be seen that the magnitude for correlations is smaller when the potential for induced abortion per pregnancy is used instead of TPIAR. This observation indicates that even if adjustments are made on the levels of fertility across states, the impact of unmet need for limiting still remains.

In terms of the induced abortion potential per pregnancy, we found that the potential for induced abortion is highest in West Bengal, followed by Karnataka and Assam, and that Uttar Pradesh shifted

lower in the ranks. Perhaps its earlier higher rank when the TPIAR per woman was considered was a reflection of the higher fertility in Uttar Pradesh (see Table 6). The potential for induced abortion is

expected to decline with improved access to limiting services and overall improvement in the quality of family planning services for spacing as well. This expectation is in keeping with the present agenda of Family Welfare Programme in India which is shifting from a target-oriented approach to a responsive, felt-needs, RCH-reproductive, and child-health approach.
In the states of Kerala and Maharashtra, one finds that the estimates of induced abortions almost match the reported ones. In Gujarat, Haryana, and Punjab, the estimated rate of induced abortions is twice that of the reported, while in Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu, it is slightly over two-times the reported ones. In other states, the estimated number of abortions is more than twice that reported

in the Family Welfare Year Book (Govt of India), sometimes as much as ten times the reported number. This finding is clearly indicative of two problems: (1) The reported number of induced abortions (MTP's) per government sources are definite underestimates; (2) The existing abortion facilities are not sufficient to meet the potential needs for induced abortion which is several times higher than the reported ones. It also suggests that there is a high volume of unwanted pregnancies, either due to lack of use of contraception or due to failure of the contraceptive used. These findings point toward the inadequacy of existing family planning and birth-preventing facilities, in terms of quality or quantity, or perhaps both.
