The proportion of twins among all births varies significantly between populations and from year to year. Most of the variation is in the number of dizygotic or two-egg twins, and the rate of two-egg twinning shows a close and strong dependence on maternal age and birth order. However, geographic and annual differences in age and parity of the female population do not account for the geographic and annual variation in twinning rates. Environmental influences like nutrition have been suggested as alternate explanations.
Another explanation, at least for annual variations in twinning, can be based on independent evidence that women who bear DZ twins conceive more promptly than the average woman. If this is true, then during a sudden rise in the birth rate, earlier conception in twin pregnancies would result in a transient high twinning rate, because the increase of births would appear in the numerator of the rate before it appeared in the denominator. The proportion of twins should be higher than normal in the early phase of increasing births, and this is just what occurred among births that followed World War II.
EVIDENCE FOR HIGH FECUNDABILITY IN MOTHERS OF TWINS
Married couples encounter different degrees of difficulty in conceiving, and this is

sometimes referred to as variation in fecundability. In the present discussion, fecundability means the ease with which a woman conceives, presumably a physiological characteristic. Fecundability is conveniently measured by waiting-time to conception, that is, the number of months of non-contraceptive cohabitation preceding a pregnancy.
Two kinds of data suggest a relation between fecundability and twinning. First, twinning is elevated among conceptions occurring in the first three months after marriage (Buhner, 1959). The probability that a woman will have twins in her first pregnancy varies, in general, with her age. From known age-specific twinning rates, Bulmer calculated the expected number of twins among first legitimate maternities in a large series for which age of mother and duration of marriage were both known. He took into account the short average gestation period of twins. For conceptions that occurred in the first three months of marriage, twins exceeded expectation by 19%. The rate of twinning when conception occurred three to fifteen months after marriage was one per cent below expectation and declined further in longer-delayed pregnancies. Within the entire distribution, twin conceptions tended to occur sooner after marriage than singleton conceptions, and presumably after a shorter period of marital sexual relations.

One possible explanation is that women who conceive most easily are also prone to bear twins.
The second source of evidence comes from premarital and illegitimate conceptions. In the study cited above, Bulmer found a rate of twinning 7% above expectation among pregnancies that started before marriage. A high twin-birth ratio has been found also among illegitimate births in Finland, specifically with respect to dizygotic (DZ) twins (Eriksson and Fellman, 1967). These independent findings both indicate a higher-than-average proportion of twins in unwanted pregnancies. In brief, highly fecundable women are more likely to be "caught" by pregnancy, and if they are also twin-prone, the twinning rate will be high among resulting births.

TWINNING PEAK OF 1946
Jeanneret and MacMahon (1962) first called attention to the remarkable peak in twinning that occurred in the United States in 1946 and effectively excluded birth rank and maternal age as explanations. The white twin-birth ratio in that year was 11.25 twin deliveries per 1,000 live births (Table 1), the highest for any year from 1939 to the present, according to Vital Statistics of the US. of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare 1939-1967 (see also National Center for Health Statistics, 1967). In Figure 1 this twinning rate is seen as a distinct peak during the first half of the postwar rise in births. Other annual fluctuations, also statistically significant, do not cast doubt on the biological significance of the 1946 peak, because if the explanation offered

here is valid for 1946, it could also account for some of the other annual changes in the twinning rate.
Annual birth statistics ordinarily describe a relatively stable condition in which, if twins were conceived with less delay than singletons, the number of twin births thereby displaced from any given year into the preceding year would be made up by those displaced from the succeeding year into the given year. This state of dynamic equilibrium would prevail as long as total births did not vary greatly from year to year, but would have been disturbed at the end of World War II (August, 1945) with the sudden release of servicemen and the resumption of normal family living by millions of American couples, all within a few months' time.
Above a baseline that had continued through the war, births occurred in great number and then settled back almost within a year to a new stable level. If twins were conceived more promptly than singletons, the observed excess of twins among early postwar births was to be expected for that reason.
The increase in twinning in 1946 was most marked in women between ages 15 and 29, whose husbands were most likely to have been in service. Table 2 further shows that

the youngest age group, which experienced the sharpest rise in twinning rate in 1946, experienced a somewhat delayed postwar birth increase, mostly in 1947. This is consistent with the above reasoning, because in this age group twin and single births were more effectively separated into the respective years. Most of the excess single births occurred after January 1,1947; many of the twins, having been conceived a little earlier, were registered in 1946 when other births were still low among these women.
That the postwar twins were born on an earlier average date than the singletons is evident in a more detailed plot of the birth statistics. Twin births by single months are not tabulated for the United States as a whole, but such data are available for California (State of California, 1964). Figure 2 shows twin births and total births by month for California in 1945, 1946, and 1947, together with the distribution of military discharges (unpublished data provided by the Veterans Administration through the courtesy of J. A. Mclntyre). The postwar increase in twin births, mainly in June and July, 1946, followed just nine months after a similar increase in military discharges. The general birth curve continued to rise asymptotically through October. The first major decrease in births following this rise

was registered in November for twins and in the following February for singletons. Thus, there appears to be a displacement between twin and singleton births of nearly three months.
A METHOD OF ESTIMATING RELATIVE WAITING-TIMES FOR SINGLETON AND D Z TWIN CONCEPTIONS FROM THE 1946 TWINNING PEAK
If the rise to asymptotic level in twin births was approximately three months earlier than the rise in all births, as appears from Figure 2, the interval should be susceptibleof mathematical verification. Ideally we would like to plot the birth curve of twins and the birth curve of singletons day by day for the postwar period and measure the time interval between corresponding points, e.g., the highest point of each curve. Daily birth figures are not available and even monthly totals for national twin births are not tabulated. The twin data for California shown in Figure 2 are inadequate to yield reliable estimates.
With suitable calculations, national birth statistics can yield the approximate median date of relevant births. When this is done separately for twins and for singletons, the errors may be sufficiently similar to cancel

each other and thus to have little effect on the interval calculated between the medians. The births of interest resulted from conceptions that had been postponed only on account of the war. These births began to occur in early 1946 and were all over by the end of 1947, in so far as two assumptions are accurate: (1) The women concerned were already married and nearly all commenced noncontraceptive intercourse between August, 1945, and January 1, 1946. (2) Virtually all of these women became pregnant within 15 months (cf. Westoff et al., 1961).
These births will be spoken of below as the excess births. Other births, those not postponed simply because of the war, would be approximately represented in the upper half of Figure 1 by the area lying below a straight line drawn between the points for 1945 and 1948. This "baseline" rose from 2.4 million births in 1945 to 3.1 million in 1948, presumably because of births in delayed postwar marriages and because of second postwar pregnancies.
Despite the rising baseline, the postwar wave of DZ twin births was large enough and early enough to result in almost identical totals for 1946 and 1947. The middle of the 24-month period, January 1, 1947, is thus given to us as the median birth date of

all twins in these years. This is found to correspond with the 57th percentile point of DZ twin births above the assumed baseline drawn between 1945 and 1948. A corresponding "median" birth date for singletons is found in the following manner.
The segment of the singleton birth curve most closely resembling the 1946-1947 DZ twin birth curve should be that segment spanning 24 months for which births in the first 12 months are equal in number to those in the second 12 months. Starting with 1946 and 1947, we find more than half of the singleton births in the second year. By shifting the time boundaries to later dates, we can increase the proportion of singleton births in the first 12 months until the median birthdate is at the middle of the 24 month period. The displacement of the singleton curve relative to the twin curve will then reflect the later conception and birth of the singletons. Inaccuracy is introduced chiefly by the fact that the true baseline is probably not straight and must differ in shape between the period in which the excess twins were born and the period in which the excess singletons were born.
Data used were monthly numbers of white live births and annual numbers of

white twin deliveries, the latter counted if at least one partner was born alive. These figures are found in Vital Statistics of theUnited States, 1945-1949. For the years after 1944 this source also gives sex-composition of twin deliveries, permitting separate estimation of the twin types by Weinberg's difference method. Total births are taken as a satisfactory approximation to singleton births.
The procedure for estimating the median date of singleton births is based on assumed birth distributions as in Figure 3. The two curves show hypothetical DZ twin births and singleton births, respectively, in the daily distribution expected if the observed relative delay in the rise of singleton births were due entirely to longer conception delays. The ordinate is measured in terms of relative number of births, taking January 1, 1946, as standard and treating twins and singletons separately. The two curves are nearly the same except that the singleton curve rises and falls more gradually. The solid vertical line near the middle of the figure marks the end of 1946 and is also the bisector of the total area under the twin birth curve for 1946 and 1947. Under the twin curve, area a -f- b equals area c-\- d.

The broken vertical lines mark 12-month intervals ("statistical years") displaced from the calendar years by the interval x, chosen so that the middle broken line bisects the area within broken lines under the singleton birth curve; under thesingleton curve, b-fc = d-\- e. The value of x estimates the time-displacement between the median date of singleton births and themedian date of DZ twin births and should bear a simple relation to the difference between twinsand singletons in waiting time to conception.
The interval x, required to yield similar 12-month totals for all births, was found by shifting January, February, and March totals, successively, tothe preceding year and, finally, by interpolating. This located the median of all births at March 26, 1947,85 days later than the median of DZ twin births. The average and presumably the median gestation time of twins is 19 days shorter than that of singletons (McKeown and Record, 1952), sothat the difference in median conception dates would be 66 days or 2.2 months.
There is no prior evidence that waiting time for MZtwin conceptions differs from that ofsingleton conceptions. The MZ twinning rates for 1946 and 1947 were moderately elevated (see Table 3), butthe difference between the twoyears can be attributed to thepremature births of thetwins. When MZ twin births for each calendar year

are divided by total births occurring twothirds of a month later, i.e., in the statistical years starting Jan. 20, the MZ twinning rates for 1946 and 1947 are nearly equalized. Table 3 shows the crude andrevised rates for both types of twins. No explanation is apparent for thefact that these years both have rather high MZ twinning rates.The relatively high rate of DZ twinning obtained for 1945 is inaccordance with the distribution of maternal ages and parities in these years.
RELATIVE FECUNDABILITY IN TWIN-PRONE WOMEN
We will here explore the quantitative implications of the 1946 twin-birth ratio under the hypothesis that twin-proneness and high fecundability are associated physiological traits. By this hypothesis, singletons born to twin-prone women would be conceived on the same prompt schedule asDZ twins, but would be counted with other singletons in ordinary vital statistics. This would shorten the average waiting time for singletons taken all together and so reduce the apparent difference between DZ twin conceptions andconceptions in women not prone to twinning. The magnitude of this distortion would depend on theproportion of all singletons that are born to twin-prone women.
The rate of twinning in twin-prone wom-

If twins in the denominator are neglected, the adjusted rates represent the ratio between twins and singletons whose parents began noncontraceptive intercourse in the same twelve months (see Fig. 3).

en can be estimated from the repeat-frequency of twinning. Wyshak and White (1965) found the rate of twin deliveries to be 0.0443 among later maternities of women who had had at least one male-female pair of twins. This included MZ twins in the second event and would correspond to repeat DZ twinning of about 0.040. The repeat frequency of DZ twinning is an overestimate of the risk in all pregnancies of twin-prone women because women who have previously had opposite-sex twins constitute a sample weighted in the higher ages and parities where twinning is most frequent. After approximate correction for this overestimation, the data of Wyshak and White yield an estimate of 0.0256 as the rate of DZ twinning in all pregnancies of twin-prone women.1 This value may still be influenced by the fact that
1 We wish to estimate the twinning rate among all deliveries of twin-prone women, but we can recognize twin-prone women only after they have borne twins. The desired estimate will be less than the repeat-frequency, that is, the frequency of twin deliveries among all deliveries of women who have already borne DZ twins, because such births occur at relatively high maternal ages and parities where DZ twinning is especially frequent. We must therefore correct the repeat-frequency of DZ twinning for the effects of maternal age and parity. These effects can be found by comparing the actual rate of twinning in the population with the rate in a simulated population of all women with the same age and parity distribution as women who have had a pair of DZ twins.
The simulation was based on 1964 birth statistics (National Center for Health Statistics, 1967; Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1964). The reported twinning rate in each maternal-age and birth-order category was weighted by the number of births and by the estimated probability that a woman in that category had borne DZ twins in an earlier year. For example, the twinning rate of women having their first delivery in 1964 received a weight of zero. For women 40-44 having their fifth delivery, a likely average child-spacing was selected and the summed probability of DZ twins at the estimated average age of each of the four prior deliveries was used in the weight for this category of women. Systematic errors were inevitable, but relatively minor in their consequences.
The frequency of DZ twins among all 1964 deliveries weighted in this manner was 0.0086, whereas the unweighted twin frequency was 0.0055. The ratio between these figures is the effect of age and parity in the repeat frequency of DZ twinning. By simple proportion, if the repeat frequency is 0.040 (Wyshak and White, 1965), then the true frequency is 0.0256 for twin-prone women having the same age and parity distribution as all 1964 mothers.

among all women bearing twins at a given age, those who have at least one subsequent birth are more fertile than the average.
Further calculations assume two homogeneous populations of women, one group twin-prone and highly fecundable, the other group unable to bear DZ twins and uniformly low in fecundability. This assumption is not realistic, but permits us to explore the general magnitude of the postulated relation between twinning and fecundability. I t should be noted that such an assumption does not underlie the original estimate of 2.2 months difference in waiting time between DZ twin conceptions and all conceptions.
The above figure, 0.0256 or about 1/40, is the estimated ratio between DZ twin deliveries and all deliveries to twin-prone women. In 1946 and 1947 DZ twin deliveries constituted 0.00671 of all deliveries. Singletons born to twin-prone women would have been about 40 times as numerous as DZ twins, amounting to 40 X 0.00671 = 0.26 of all births. If these conceptions had the same short waiting time as DZ twins, they must have lowered the average waiting time found for singletons; that is, the remaining 74% of singleton births, considered by themselves would have differed in waiting time from DZ twins by considerably more than the 2.2 months difference found in the preceding section between DZ twins and all births. The average waiting time for all births is the mean of the waiting times of the respective populations weighted by their sizes (cf. Sheps, 1965):
L = 0.26 i i + 0.74 £2
where L\ and Z^ are the waiting times of twin-prone and non-twin-prone women, respectively. We have estimated that the mean waiting time for all women is 2.2 months greater than the waiting time of twin-prone women: L = L\ -f- 2.2. When this substitution is made, we find that L^ = i i + 3.0. Three months is therefore the difference in waiting time between twin-prone

women and non-twin-prone women, if they constitute two homogeneous populations. If the true average waiting time for all conceptions were five months (Westoff et al., 1961), that for twin-prone women would be 5 -- 2.2, or 2.8 months, and that for other women would be 2.8 + 3, or 5.8 months.
DISCUSSION
The high twinning rate of 1946 could be explained in several ways. The general explanation offered here is based on the hypothesis that DZ twin conceptions occur more promptly than singleton conceptions after commencement of a sexual relationship. This hypothesis may take either of two forms, neither of which can as yet be convincingly supported with available data.
1. Association of high feciindability with events of double ovulation. Fecundability might be increased during the months in which double ovulation occurs. Double ovulation may result from higher gonadotrophins (Milham, 1964), or may cause increased ovarian steroid excretion; either of these states could be physiologically favorable for conception. Or the presence of two ova in the reproductive tract might favor fertilization of both.
This explanation is apparently, but not necessarily, excluded by the finding of Wyshak (1969) that in sibships containing twins, the twin gestation is peculiar not by early conception, but by delayed conception, usually following the prior birth by an over-long interval. Some of the delay disappears when twin gestations are compared with other gestations at the same maternal age. Moreover, the delay is similar for samesex and for opposite-sex twins, suggesting that it depends not on ovulation and conception, but on the greater risks in any multiple pregnancy. These risks would probably be accentuated when the interval from the preceding birth was very short; this would result in a relatively high loss of twins among

closely spaced births and hence in a greater average interval preceding twin births.
Another difficulty with this explanation is perhaps more serious. Tentative calculations indicate that an extreme effect on fecundability is needed to explain the 2.2month difference in average waiting time, if this effect is restricted to the cycles in which double ovulation occurs.
2. Association of high fecundability with constitutional twin-proneness. The relatively prompt conception of DZ twins could also be explained in terms of a permanent physiological advantage in fecundability for women prone to DZ twin pregnancy. Both tendencies may express a single physiological characteristic that women possess in different degrees. This assumption was explored above under the heading "Relative Fecundability in Twin Prone Women." Weinberg (1902) considered and dismissed the possibility that mothers of DZ twins had more closely spaced pregnancies than other women. He compared birth intervals in families of 144 like-sexed twin pairs with those in families of 71 unlike-sexed pairs and found that the latter intervals were longer, on the average, by 1.2 months, instead of shorter as required by the hypothesis. Wyshak (1969) compared birth intervals in her series of twin families with those reported by Schutzenberger (1950) for families containing singletons only. The average interval in the twin families was five months longer than in the families of singletons with the same number of confinements. These two populations were drawn from different countries and different centuries, so that such factors as age at marriage and breast feeding might explain the difference.
We have examined some unpublished data, kindly furnished by G. Wyshak and R. A. Greenberg, that permitted a comparison of intervals between singleton births in families of unlike-sexed twins (3,554 observations) and in families without twins, all drawn from the same population of com-
