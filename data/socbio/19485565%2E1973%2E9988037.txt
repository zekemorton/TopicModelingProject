The adoption of family planning and contraceptive use in a society is a function of the modernization process. Societies which are highly industrialized and urbanized are those which typically have the highest proportion of couples practicing family planning. In the process of moving toward an urban-industrial style of life, however, the rate of adoption differs for subgroups in the population. In the West, the concept of family planning and the use of new contraceptive techniques were adopted first by the upper and middle classes, and by residents of urban areas (Hawthorn, 1970). Although these same differentials can now be found in many developing countries of Latin America, Asia, and Africa, a new variable in the form of organized family planning programs, both governmental and private, has been added.
In the developing countries, the results of surveys to determine the correlates of interest in family planning have shown that education, parity, age, and interval since last birth are consistently important variables (Berelson, 1969). Both education and parity tend to be positively related to interest in family planning, while interval since

last birth is negatively related. Age has a curvilinear relationship, with women in the age group between 25 and 34 showing the greatest interest. Despite the fact that many people feel it ought to be an important variable, religion generally shows little relationship to interest in family planning.
However, interest in family planning is not the same thing as practice. The basic philosophy of most family planning programs is that the concept of family planning and the use of contraceptives can be disseminated through all strata of society. Many family planning clinics are set up to reach the lower-income and less-educated segments of society, if not explicitly, at least implicitly by offering services free or at a low cost.
The basic questions to be addressed in this paper concern the correlates of clinic utilization. Are the factors found to be correlated with interest in family planning also related to clinic attendance, or do family planning clinics appeal only to a limited subgroup of those women interested in family planning? Secondly, what differences exist between women who drop out of clinics and those who remain active?

knowledge variables, the measures of reproductive and contraceptive knowledge cannot be used as predictors of clinic attendance. An important aspect of the family planning clinics in Costa Rica is a program of education in reproduction and contraception. Thus, to a large extent, higher reproductive and contraceptive knowledge is a consequence rather than an antecedent of clinic attendance.
The final point to be discussed concerning the variables eliminated from the analysis is ·with respect to the problem of multicollinearity (high intercorrelations between independent variables). An analysis of the independent variables revealed two clusters of intercorrelated variables. The first set included age, age at first con-

ception, age at first intercourse, and age at which respondent first learned of contraception. These variables have an average intercorrelation of 0.4S.
The relatively high correlations between age and the sexual experience variables are partially artifacts of the sampling design which included only women with at least one pregnancy. This assured that all the younger women in the sample had a young age at first conception and, at least for attenders, a young age when they first learned of contraception. On the other hand, the older women constitute a more complete cohort of women who have ever had children, many having a higher age at first conception.

appeared to represent the dimension of internal-external control. These four items were used to compute the current IE score. The score ranges from a low of zero to a high of four, the high score indicating a strong belief in the individual's ability to control his/her own destiny.
Birth Control Scale. The attitude toward birth control scale was computed from four items concerned with the relationship of birth control to health, its expense, importance for national welfare, and the ease with which it can be understood. The women expressed agreement or disagreement with each statement on a five-point scale ranging from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree." In computing the scale, the most negative answer was assigned a score of zero and the most positive answer a score of four. The scale consists of the sum of scores for all four items. Thus, a person with a completely negative attitude toward all aspects of birth control included in the four items would have a score of zero. A respondent with a highly positive attitude would have a score of sixteen.
Family Planning Scale. The family planning scale is a summary score based on response (agree-disagree) to thirteen negative statements about family planning, contraception, and clinic utilization. Since these statements are analyzed separately in Table 5 they will not be discussed in detail at this point, except to note that the summary score is based on a positive or negative response to these statements. The respondent was assigned a zero if she agreed with the statement and a one if she disagreed. Thus, a woman negative toward all aspects of family planning covered in the statements received a total score of zero. A woman agreeing with none of the negative statements received a score of thirteen.
It should be noted that the family planning scale and the birth control scale overlap conceptually to some extent. However,

the correlation between them is not high (r = 0.21) and thus causes no problems of multicollinearity. The birth control score can best be thought of as measuring very general feelings about birth control, while the family planning score focuses on some specific aspects of contraception, family planning, and clinic procedures.
RESULTS
The basic technique used to examine these data was multiple regression analysis. The independent variables were first checked for possible nonlinear relationships, entered into a stepwise regression analysis, and then correlated in various combinations to check for possible suppressor relationships among variables that showed no initial correlation with clinic attendance or continuation.
Although it would have been desirable to examine all variables and all possible interaction terms simultaneously, the capacity of the computer used for the analysis did not allow this. Thus, only the variables retained according to the criterion of adding at least one per cent to the total explained variation were checked for interaction. For these variables, no appreciable interaction was detected.
Given the nature of the sample and the large number of cases, little attention has been paid to tests of statistical significance in the interpretation of results. The results of such tests, however, are presented in the tables.
CLINIC ATTENDANCE
The seven variables found to be of some importance in predicting clinic attendance are parity, income, age, race, the internalexternal control (IE) scale, the family planning scale, and the self-concept scale. The distribution of the variables and the zeroorder correlations with clinic attendance are shown in Table 2. It can be seen that,

a moderately low positive relationship emerges within each category of age. This "suppressor effect" is due to the fact the parity has a relatively strong positive relationship with age (r = 0.60) and age has a basically curvilinear relationship (with a strong negative component) with clinic attendance. Older women, who as a group have the highest parity, are also less likely to be clinic attenders. Thus age and parity tend to have a cancelling effect on one another.
The negative correlation between race and clinic attendance indicates that nonwhites are less likely to be clinic attenders than are whites. Since it was noted earlier that almost all the nonwhites in the sample are rural, it should be stressed that the observed relationship between race and clinic attendance is not a function of ruralness; white women in the urban and rural areas have higher rates of attendance than nonwhite women.
With respect to the IE score, women who have a stronger belief in their ability to control their own destiny are more likely to be clinic attenders, although in this case the correlation is quite low.
Women with a more positive attitude toward family planning are more likely to be clinic attenders, and lower income women are more likely to be clinic attenders. The negative relationship between income and

clinic attendance is as expected since the clinics provide a number of free services aimed at reaching the poorer segment of the population.
As noted previously, the relationship between age and clinic attendance shows some nonlinearity. This is also true of the selfconcept scale. For age, a relatively low percentage of younger women are attenders, the percentage increases to a maximum between the ages of 25-29 and declines at the higher ages. The distribution of the self-concept scale is just the reverse of age. A fairly high percentage of women with a low self-concept are attenders; the percentage of attenders declines for women in the middle-ranges of the self-concept scale; and it is highest for women with a high selfconcept.
Both the linear and nonlinear components of the relationships are shown in Table 2. For age, the addition of the nonlinear component raises the explained variation from 5% to 7%. For the self-concept scale, the nonlinear component raises the explained variation from 5% to 6%. The increment in the multiple regression coefficient from the nonlinear components raises the total explained variation (for all variables) from 22% to 24%.
The multiple regression analysis of all variables is shown in Table 4. The total explained variation of 24% suggests that the seven variables are of some importance in distinguishing between attenders and nonattenders. The standardized regression coefficients indicate that age is the most important variable in terms of the ability to produce a change (statistically) in the proportion of attenders. Parity, income, race, the self-concept scale, and the family planning scale are somewhat less important and about equal in power, while the IE scale is least important. The direction of each partial relationship is the same as for the zero-order correlations.

CLINIC CONTINUATION
Only three variables were found to bear some relationship to clinic continuation: the birth control scale, the IE scale, and the family planning scale. It is significant to note that only psychological items were found to be important here. Apparently the decision to remain active or drop out of a clinic is not directly dependent on the background characteristics or sexual experience/knowledge of a woman.
The distribution of the independent variables and the correlations with clinic continuation are shown in Table 5. All relationships were found to be basically linear in form and all are relatively low. Women more favorable toward birth control who have a stronger belief in their ability to control their own destiny and who have a more favorable attitude toward the various aspects of family planning are more likely to remain active in the family planning clinics.
The multiple regression analysis shown in Table 6 indicates that only about 7% of the variation in clinic continuation can be

explained by the three variables acting together. The standardized regression coefficients indicate that the family planning scale is approximately twice as important as either of the other independent variables in producing a change in the proportion of attenders remaining active. The direction of all partial relationships remains the same as for the zero-order correlations.

Two variables were found to be related to both clinic attendance and clinic continuation. Interpretation of the IE scale is fairly straightforward. The correlations were low, but suggested that women who feel they have more control over their lives are more likely to attend family planning clinics and also to remain active.
The family planning scale, however, is somewhat more complicated. It is composed of many diverse items, and a more specific examination of the separate items will be helpful in understanding this scale's relationship to clinic attendance and clinic continuation. Table 7 shows the proportion

most of the women in all three groups. The results with respect to religion are in accord with the findings noted earlier, while the negative results with respect to worry about resistance on the part of husbands and negative reinforcement from friends and neighbors tends to contradict much current thinking in the area of family planning (Bogue, 1967). However, it should be noted that these results may be specific to Costa Rican family structure.

hypothesis that experiences in the clinic setting may be more important than characteristics of the women in predicting dropouts. If this is the case, some insight can be gained by examining the reasons for discontinuing clinic attendance. The reasons reported by the dropouts in this sample are shown in Table 8.
These data indicate that pregnancy is by
TABLE 8

REASONS FOR DISCONTINUING CLINIC ATTENDANCE
The analysis of clinic continuation suggested that background and sexual experience/knowledge factors were of little predictive importance. Psychological variables were found to be of some importance; but two of the three were concerned with attitudes about birth control and family planning/clinic procedures. This finding, the preceding analysis of the specific negative statements about family planning, and the results of the other studies concerned with specific clinic procedures and problems (Speidel and Wiener, 1970) leads to the

far the most important reason for dropping out. The response in this category refers primarily to contraceptive failure, since a different response was made by women who wanted another baby. Most of the women reporting pregnancy were using the IUD, which along with the birth control pill is a highly popular contraceptive technique in Costa Rica.
The second most important factor, health reasons, refers primarily to fear of contraception, medical examinations, etc. reported in the preceding section. The next most important reason, the method didn't suit the respondent, refers to the contraceptive technique itself.
Overall, the responses suggest that physical and psychological problems with the method of contraception are the most important reasons for dropping out of the clinic. In addition, the earlier analysis, which failed to predict clinic continuation well, suggests that these problems are not specific to particular subgroups of women.
DISCUSSION
Analysis of the factors related to clinic attendance indicated that four background characteristics--parity, age, race, and income--were of some importance in differentiating attenders from nonattenders. The positive relationship between parity and clinic attendance and the curvilinear relationship between age and clinic attendance are in accord with the reports of interest in family planning in developing countries. Women of higher parity were found to be more interested in family planning, and women in the youngest and oldest age groups were found to be less interested in family planning. The results of this study indicate that, in Costa Rica, these relationships also apply to attendance at family planning clinics.
It is of particular interest to note that initially parity and clinic attendance

showed no relationship.1 A positive relationship emerged when age was introduced as a control. Statistically, this is due to a relatively strong positive relationship between parity and clinic attendance, and the curvilinear relationship between age and clinic attendance. As a result, older women of higher parity also tend to be nonattenders. Substantively, this is at least partially due to the fact that many of the older highparity women are in the last stages of their childbearing period and have little need of family planning services. Also important is the fact that the older women tend to be most traditional in their outlook and as a group have less interest in family planning, regardless of their parity.
The results with respect to income and race are important in that they point out the success of the family planning clinics in reaching low-income women, but a relative lack of success in reaching the nonwhite (Indian) population which is the lowest income group in Costa Rica. As noted earlier, the negative relationship between income and clinic attendance is as expected since the clinics provide a number of services oriented toward the low-income population. However, the fact that nonwhites are less likely to attend than whites may suggest an area of needed improvement in the family planning programs.
Perhaps the most important results with respect to clinic attendance are those which suggest that psychological variables may be of greater importance than previously be-
1 The general relationship between parity and clinic attendance is somewhat attenuated by the sampling restriction that the women have had at least one pregnancy. Since very few women who have never been pregnant attend family planning clinics in the developing countries, inclusion of these women would have sharply reduced the mean parity of all nonattenders, but would have had little effect on the mean parity of attenders. Thus, it is important to emphasize that our conclusions with respect to parity (and all other variables as well) are limited to women with at least one pregnancy.
