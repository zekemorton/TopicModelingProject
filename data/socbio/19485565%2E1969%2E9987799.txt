were used in the larger study, but we have only selected those which seemed to show a significant relationship with the two dependent variables. References to the independent variables will be made during discussion of the findings. I t is interesting that, on the whole, people in this sample prefer smaller families. As is evident from Table 2, 59% of the sample prefer to have no more than three children, while 82% prefer no more than four children.
Table 3 gives the values of coefficients of correlation between the two dependent variables and several other independent variables. As will be seen from the table, several variables are significantly associated with the two dependent measures. There are seven variables, each one of which accounts for at least 10% variance in the dependent variables taken individually (r2 --0.10). These are variables relating to (lack of) fatalism, education, personal overall modernization (O.M.),2 political O.M., and total O.M. (1 and 2), and family scale. One interesting finding is the substantial amount of positive correlation between the dependent variables themselves (r = 0.385). Those who desire a small family also prefer to use family-planning methods and are favorably disposed toward birth control.
To better understand the relation of the occupational and ethnic factors to familysize preference and attitude toward family planning, the sample was divided into main caste or ethnicity groups and major occupational groups. Tables 4 and 5 present the distribution of the sample on these two dependent variables.
2 Inkeles (1966) defines modernization in terms of readiness for new experience, openness for innovation and change, democratic orientation, general planning in life, belief in efficacy of man over nature, stress on dignity, faith in science and technology, and belief in distributive justice. Inkeles recognizes five sources of modernizing influence: urbanization, mass communication, development of a nation-state, the modern factory; and the last, but perhaps the most important of all, schools emphasizing a modern type of curriculum.

Table 4 shows the pronounced effect of education among factory workers, particularly among the urban factory workers, with regard to their attitude toward ideal family size. High-educated factory workers significantly differ from the low-educated factory workers in urban areas, irrespective of ethnicity, caste, or religion. Both in rural and

rural-urban areas, high education apparently exercises an influence on the factory workers' attitude toward small family size, but it does not seem to have such an influence in purely urban areas.
Another interesting indication from the data in Table 4 is that education does not seem to influence the attitude toward small family size in the nonfactory population (cultivators and urban nonindustrial workers). The only exception is among the lowcaste Hindus whose views on ideal family size differ according to their educational level. If we ignore this small difference, we may be able to contrast the two major groups: factory workers and nonfactory workers. The main difference between these two groups seems to be one based on insti-

tutionalization; workers in a factory tend to be more influenced by factory mores and values, while the nonfactory workers (farmers, rickshaw pullers, servants, etc.) tend to be less exposed to such institutional influences.

Table 5 shows again the effect of education on the attitude toward birth control. However, the influence of education in this case is significant only in nonfactory groups (cultivators and urban nonindustrial workers). The factory workers, whether in rural,

urban, or rural-urban areas, exhibit favorable attitudes toward birth control, irrespective of their educational level. In other words, the factory environment seems to overcome the unfavorable attitude associated with low education. Inkeles (1966) points out that the factory is not only an employing agency but also an educating agency. The socializing influence of the working conditions in the factory seems to underlie the uniformly favorable attitude toward family planning.
The comments made about Tables 3 and 4 above raise several questions. Table 4 shows that education differentiates factory workers in their concept of ideal family size. What happens to the educative influence of the factory atmosphere? And why do the cultivator and urban-nonindustrial-worker groups show no differences due to education? Since the two dependent variables under study are significantly correlated, we expect to find similar results in Tables 4 and 5. However, we do not find such results. One plausible explanation is that familysize preference is a widely shared norm generated by the larger community in which a person lives and that the change in such a deeply ingrained norm comes about when a person has a new reference group (an institution, like a factory) and also has exposure to the wider world (through education). On the other hand, attitude toward birth control may be more a function of more knowledge about it, and this is provided either by exposure to formal education (and, therefore, possibility of reading, or by exposure to informal sources of information (in an institution, like a factory). It is evident from the two tables that both formal education and membership in a work organization are important in influencing family-size norms and attitudes toward birth control.
For a better understanding of the relationship between some independent and the dependent variables, some matched groups
