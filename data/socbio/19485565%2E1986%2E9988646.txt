ABSTRACT: An epidemic model of suicides clustered in time and space is presented. In this model suicides are depicted as an infection that can be spread from person to person. The model is based on the assumption that spread of suicide ideation via various means of communication increases as the number of suicides increases. A threshold condition for an epidemic to begin and the total size of an epidemic can be calculated. The model is applied to several previous suicide episodes.

The concept of a suicide epidemic has been discussed in the literature and mass media for many years (Ashton and Donnan, 1979; Barraclough et al., 1977; Crawshaw, 1980; Gelman, 1983; Kreitman et al., 1969; Motto, 1967; Nalin, 1972; Rubenstein, 1983; Taylor, 1984; Whitlock, 1975). This terminology has been applied to clusters of suicides. These clusters in time and space are called epidemic when the observed number of suicides is substantially greater than the expected number. The clusters become particularly apparent when the deaths are among adolescents.
Recently, there have been several clusters of teenage suicides in the .United States (Gelman and Gangelhoff, ^ 9 8 3 ; Taylor, 1984). In such instances a single event appears to trigger a sequence of suicides. Several investigators have studied whether publicity increases suicides (Blumenthal and Bergner, 1973; Bollen and Phillips, 1982; Motto, 1967; Motto, 1970; Phillips, 1974). The primary focus of this research is to determine whether or not extensive media coverage of a suicide results in an in-

creased suicide rate in an impressionable population.
Phillips (1974) proposed that suicides increase immediately after a suicide story has been publicized in the newspapers. The more publicity devoted to a story, the larger the rise in suicides thereafter. The rise in suicides is mainly restricted to the area in which the story was publicized. He stated that the rise in suicides is due to the influence of suggestion--something he called the Werther effect, named after the protagonist in Goethe's novel The Sorrows of the Young Werther. In this novel, the hero committed suicide. The book was widely read in Europe, and it was said that people in many countries imitated Werther's manner of death.
A major contribution to the study of suicide was made at the end of the last century by the French sociologist Emile Durkheim (1951). In an attempt to explain suicide patterns, he divided suicides into three social categories: egoistic, altruistic, and anomic.
Egoistic suicide comprised those who were assumed not to have been strongly

integrated into any social group. Family integration or the lack of it could be used to explain why the unmarried were more vulnerable to suicide than the married and why couples with children were the best protected of all.
Altruistic suicide described the group whose proneness to suicide stemmed from their excessive integration into a group. Durkheim was describing the kind of suicide that could be expected of certain classes in Japanese society at that time.
Anomic suicide occurred when a disturbance in the balance of the person's integration with society leaves him without his customary norms of behavior. Anomie could explain the greater incidence of suicide among the divorced as compared with the married. Phillips (1974) presented some theoretical relationships for the possibility of the influence of suggestion on suicide as it relates to anomic individuals. He stated that studies of suicide and of collective behavior indicate that anomic persons are susceptible to solutions to their anomie. Persons who find no meaning in life are thought to be susceptible to religious and political movements which provide them with coherent belief systems that reduce their anomie. Committing suicide or joining certain social movements may be alternative solutions to the general problem of anomie. If suicide and social movements are sometimes alternative solutions to the problem of anomie, why do some anomic individuals then choose suicide? Phillips proposed that it was due to the publicity of certain events and the unavailability or inadequacy of anomie-reducing social movements.
The type of publicity given to suicide should affect the suicide rate. Studies of suggestion (Lang and Lang, 1961) indicate that a model is more likely to be im-

itated if he is prestigious and if his cir-
cumstances are thought to be similar to
the imitator.
Phillips (1974, 1977, 1978, 1980,
1982a, 19826,1983) has presented a the-^
sis through several articles that suicides,
motor vehicle fatalities, and airplane ac-
cidents increase after publicized stories
about'one of these particular events. In
his 1980 paper, he presented a sociologi-
cal theory of imitation and suggestion.
He proposed to conceive of imitation as
a kind of cultural contagion and de-
scribed six analogies of biological and
cultural contagion. These analogies
were:
1. Incubation period.-- Just as the symptoms of a disease may appear sometime after a person is infected, the response to a publicized suicide may have a lag time.
2. Immunization.--People become immune to specific infectious diseases. Why can't they become immune to the idea of suicide?
3. Specific versus diffuse contagion.-- Specific organisms cause specific diseases. Publicity about a particular suicide may result in suicides committed in a similar fashion, e.g., wrist cuts, hangings, firearms, etc.
4. Susceptibility to contagion.-- Persons in poor biological health may be more susceptible to biological contagion. Persons who are anomic, have a low selfesteem, and a past history of failure may be said to be in poor cultural and psychological health. Are these people susceptible to cultural contagion?
5. Channels of infection.--Infectiou^L diseases can be spread through different media--air, air, water, person-to-person. Cultural contagion could be spread by newspapers, television, or by word of mouth.
6. Quarantine.--The spread of infectious disease can be slowed or stopped by quarantining infectious individuals. Could a cultural quarantine similarly reduce the spread of a cultural contagion? Would less publicity devoted to a suicide result in less of a "contagious effect?"

Also, we assume that the number of immunes is proportional to the number of immunes and susceptibles. The more immune individuals there are, the more likely it is that their influence will prevent further suicides; the more susceptibles there are, the more likely it is they will become immune.
In the model there is a competition for the susceptible population to either commit suicide or become immune. Thus, the larger the susceptible population, the more likely it is both that a new suicide will occur and that the number of immunes will increase.
The following system of differential equations describes the model at time t after the initial suicide which began the epidemic process.

data by using a nonlinear regression method.
There is a large body of literature on the solution to such a system of equations. They are with minor modifications the Kermack and McKendrick (1927) equations for an epidemic process with removal of individuals from risk of subsequent infection. In this instance a substitution which gives an approximate solution to Equations (2) to (4) provides a solution which is simple to use and is suitable to a suicide epidemic process.
At the start of the epidemic when t = 0, the epidemic is initiated by a single suicide; hence,

At t = 1, this becomes D = (NoIIo)p и

If we assume

Equation (6) is a logistic-type equation with unknown parameters Io, p, and p. In a closed population of size No and with specification of these parameters, one can calculate the total number of suicides that will occur.
A THRESHOLD CONDITION
Before applying the model to actual data on the temporal occurrence of suicides, we wish to further analyze Equation (2) to obtain conditions under which an epidemic will continue. For the moment we drop the argument t for D(t) and /(/) in the subsequent analysis.
Let us divide Equation (2) by Equation (4) to get dDldl = \LDI$L
The solution to this equation for d is D = kl^V where k is a constant and for convenience D is expressed in terms of the reciprocal of the relative removal rate, p, to get D = kP. The initial condition where D(0) = 1, determine the constant k = Io~p, and hence
D=

or the number of suicides is much less than the number of immunes, this reduces to

N0>I0Dl/P or

or D<

(7)

The epidemic stops when D' = 0, or equivalently where D = (No/Io)p as we derived previously (Equation [6]).
So, for the epidemic to continue beyond a second suicide, (No/Io)p must be greater than 2 or

(8)
Since Io ~ No--So Equation (8) becomes

(So/No) & 1 -2-P'*.
The relative removal rate (3/JJI therefore gives us a threshold proportion (Sol No)for the number of susceptibles to go beyond two suicides.

Substituting this result into Equation (1) yields the derivative of D with respect to t,
D' = iLD(N0 -D -I0DVP).
In order for the epidemic to continue,
D'>0 or
NO-D-IOD1/P>0
or No> D

STATISTICAL METHODS
Estimates of the parameters p, IoINo, and pN0 were obtained by using a nonlinear regression method. The SAS NLIN procedure (SAS User's Guide, 1982) provides least-squares estimates of these parameters. The procedure used was the Marquardt iterative method.
