ABSTRACT:This study of 766 black women confirms and partially explains reports of higher birth weights among foreign-born women. Subjects were new registrants for prenatal care at a public clinic in Harlem, New York City, 1971-73, and part of a randomized trial of nutritional supplementation during pregnancy. Three nativity groups were represented: New York City, southern United States, and foreign countries. Despite standard selection of all subjects for high risk of low birth weight, foreign-born women had only 3.8 per cent of births under 2,500 grams in contrast with 15.6 per cent among the southern-born and 18.4 per cent among the NYC-born women. Six sets of variables were examined in relation to the birth-weight outcome. An average birth-weight advantage of 218 grams for the foreign-born was found to be associated with higher childhood social status and more positive health behaviors.

tionists. Birth weight and other relevant medical data were obtained from the hospital records.
Figure 1 sets out the causal sequence we hypothesized to explain relationships of various factors known to be associated with birth weight. This sequence attempts to consider mechanisms by which social differences may be translated into biological outcomes. Thus, if our foreign-born women were to show more favorable pregnancy outcomes than their nativeborn counterparts, we expected that they should be of higher childhood social status. Such advantage on childhood social status should be reflected in advantages on indices of early nutrition, nutrition at conception and during pregnancy, measures of health behavior, and current socioeconomic status.
In Table 1, we list operational definitions of the groups of variables to be used for testing this hypothesis. The social history questionnaire yielded information relating to the two types of socioeconomic measures. Childhood social status is defined in terms of usual occupation of the gravida's parents. Current socioeconomic status includes six measures, gravida's occupation, occupation of husband (or baby's father), welfare status, education of gravida and her husband, and per capita

income. Occupation was classified as follows: Class I, owner-proprietors, professional and managerial personnel; Class II, skilled workers, craftsmen, clerical and white-collar service groups; Class III, semi-skilled workers; and Class IV, unskilled workers and service occupations.
Height was used to define early nutrition. Triceps skinfold, which remains relatively stable even during the course of pregnancy (Hytten and Leitch, 1971), served as an operational index of general nutrition at conception. Although arm girth and subscapular skinfolds were measured at the time of prenatal registration, they were not included in this analysis since they change during pregnancy, and the time of gestation at registration was not standardized. Prepregnant weight is a second measure of nutrition at conception. Average daily protein and calorie intake, calculated from 24-hour nutritional histories, measure nutrition during pregnancy.
Cigarette smoking, time of registration at the prenatal clinic, and planning of the pregnancy were measures "of health behaviors thought possibly to be related to pregnancy outcome.

RESULTS
Mean birth weights of the three nativity groups are shown in Table 2. Foreignborn women are at a clear advantage. The mean birth weight of this group is 218 grams higher than that of the next highest group, the southern-born women, a statistically significant difference (p<0.001). Mean birth weights for the southern and New York City cohorts differed by only 48 grams.
More important than the statistically significant difference in birth weight for the foreign-born women is the biological significance of the difference. The original intervention study chose to test for an in-

crease of 120 grams in birth weight, feeling that such an increase would be biologically meaningful since birth weight discrepanc ' e s between the offspring of cigarette smokers and nonsmokers and between American blacks and whites of similar social status are in this range. Further, such a change in mean birth weight was expected to nearly eliminate the difference in black and white perinatal mortality rates (Rush et al., 1974). The 218 gram advantage of the foreign-born is 80 per cent higher than the 120 gram figure.
Age of women in the three cohorts ranged from 14 to 45 years. The New York City group was the youngest, with a mean age of 20.1 years. Southern women were intermediate at 23.0 years and the foreign women, the oldest at 24.3 years. The birth weight superiority of the foreign women

was sustained in all age categories except for the under-17 age group which contains only one foreign-born woman (Figure 2). Age-adjusted birth weights were 2,962 grams, 2,971 grams, and 3,129 grams for the New York City, southern, and foreign groups respectively. Even after adjusting for the age differences, the foreign women show a 158 gram superiority over the next closest group, a biologically significant difference.
Gestation at delivery was 5 days longer on the average for the foreign-born cohort. Only 11.4 per cent of the foreign women delivered prior to 37 weeks. This figure contrasts with 24.3 per cent for the other cohorts (p<0.001). Within gestation categories, foreign-born women retain

their birth-weight superiority, particularly for the shorter gestation periods. Under 37 weeks gestation, the foreign-born hold an advantage of about 400 grams over the other cohorts, while over 37 weeks gestation the advantage is whittled to about 160 grams.
NATIVITY AND CHILDHOOD FACTORS
Childhood social status was represented by a wide range of parental occupations. Table 3 gives the distributions of parents' occupations by nativity cohort (I = highest, IV = lowest). Over onethird of the New York City group and nearly one-third of the southern women did not know their father's occupation. Among the foreign-born, fewer than 10

su-

cent did not know their father's occupation. Among those for whom father's occupation was known, the occupational distributions differed significantly for the three groups (X2 = 179.3; p<0.0001). The fathers of the foreign-born women clearly were engaged in higher status occupations than those of the other two cohorts. The foreign cohort also had fewer mothers in the lowest occupational classification. Thus, the foreign-born cohort represents a higher childhood social status in comparison with the two native-born cohorts.
Birth weight showed a positive linear relationship with both father's and mother's occupation for the foreign women, but not for the native-born women. Within occupational classes, mean birth weight was consistently highest for the foreign-born women, although not statistically significant in all classes.

CURRENT SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS
The study population was recruited from a public prenatal clinic. This limited the variation of current socioeconomic status. It is interesting to note that the six measures of social status are not comparable across nativity groups (Tables 4 and 5). Some of the differences, such as in subject's education, are related to age differences in the cohorts. Many of the New York City women are young enough not to have finished high school. In addition to age, there are effects of place of childhood residence on education. The foreign-born women, despite their relatively higher childhood social class, have a lower mean education level (10.6 years) than do other groups(p<0.001). While foreign-born subjects had less education than their native-born counterparts, their husband had more education (p<0.001).

The occupational classifications of the foreign-born subjects also tended to be slightly lower than those of the nativeborn. However, education and occupation for the foreign women were inconsistent with other social class measures. Among the foreign-born women, per capita income, like husband's education, was higher, and none of this group was on welfare. In contrast, more than 25 per cent of the native women were on welfare. Thus, years of education is an incomplete and even misleading measure of social status for the foreign women, since it is inconsistent with other measures reflecting childhood and current family social status. Among the current social variables, only welfare status and educational attainment of the gravida's husband showed the expected relationship with birth weight for all three groups. The gravida's educational attainment was related for the New York City and southern-born groups but not for the foreign-born women.
PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS
Since age and body weight are known to be related, with younger women generally being lighter than older women, we anticipated that the New York cohort might tend to be lighter and thinner than

the other groups, perhaps being overselected by the recruitment criteria relating to body weight.
Table 6 shows the mean values for the biological indices of nutrition. The foreign-born women are slightly shorter and heavier than the women in the other two groups. The differences are not, however, statistically significant. It therefore appears that the recruitment criteria of the study successfully selected, across nativity groups, women of similar physical characteristics. However, it could be argued that light weight older women might be at higher risk of low birth weight than light weight young women since mean maternal weight tends to increase slightly with age. Since this difference should have the effect of increasing the risk of low birth weight among the foreign women and thus decreasing their advantage over the other groups, their large birth weight advantage is the more impressive.
HEALTH BEHAVIORS
Cigarette smoking, stage of gestation at time of registration at the prenatal clinic, marital status, planning of the pregnancy, and the level of use of the experimental dietary supplement were health-related behaviors thought possibly to be related to

Similarly, the lack of association of birth weight with childhood social status within the native-born groups may reflect disadvantage in this country at the time the women were growing up. Thus, parental occupation may be a poor reflection of childhood social status for native-born blacks, being inconsistent with other measures such as parental education.
Because of the relative youth of the New York City cohort, current measures of social status, in reality, probably measure both childhood and current environment since they are the same for that portion of the group who still live at home. As a result of their young age and the common pattern in Harlem of pregnant teenaged girls living with their mothers, many of the New York City women in the study population do live with at least one parent.
The birth-weight advantage of the foreign-born women thus appears related, in part, to their higher social class of origin which, in turn, is reflected in higher current SES and positive health behaviors related to the pregnancy experience, particularly smoking status. It should be noted that, in general, the foreign-born women were fairly representative of foreign-born, pregnant, black women registered at the municipal hospital prenatal clinic under study while the New York City southern women are less well off than the clinic population from which they were drawn. This discrepancy may have resulted in part from the fact that a higher proportion of the foreign-born women were recruited by the diet criterion (a history of protein intake less than 50 grams in 24 hours prior to registration at prenatal clinic) in contrast with the New York women in the study who were recruited more frequently on the low prepregnant weight and previous low-birth-weight infant criteria. Since the

foreign-born group is more varied and more representative of the population from which they were drawn, a finding of relationships in the group suggests that similar relationships should be found in a more general population sample.
This finding of more positive health behavior and of a correlation between SES and positive health behaviors in the foreign group is a point for prevention, as these represent factors modifiable within the existing structure of public health resources. A next important step is to examine the relationship of health behaviors to each of the other variable sets and to quantify their relative unique contribution to birth weight. Since nativity here appears to represent different socioeconomic experiences in childhood, the relative contributions of links in the causal chain should vary by nativity cohort. It may be, for example, that with a better childhood socioeconomic background, the women are in better general physiological condition and may be less affected either positively or negatively by current socioeconomic status or nutritional status than those from poorer beginnings. Identification of such relationships should clarify preventive issues. Results of our multivariate analysis will be reported in a subsequent paper.
