ABSTRACT: Previous tests of the economic theory of fertility using multivariate regression techniques have generally analyzed only cross-sectional data. Some students of fertility, notably Janowitz (1973a,b), have argued that such studies must also be conducted with change data. This paper presents tests of the economic theory of fertility with both cross-sectional and change data for the 48 contiguous states. The cross-sectional analyses examined the effects of male and female income on the marital fertility of 20-24 year olds for 1950, 1960, and 1970 while controlling for the effects of education, urbanization, race, religion, and population density. Controlling for the effects of the same noneconomic variables, a second set of multivariate regression analyses examined the effects of changes in male and female income on changes in the level of marital fertility of 20-24 year olds during the 1950-60 and 1960-70 periods. Both the analyses with cross-sectional data and change scores provided support for the economic theory.

Several studies either directly concerned tivariate regression analyses of marital fer-

with the economic theory of fertility or tility. The results of both individual level

as the indicator of cost of children. Also, all of these studies attempted to control for the effects of one or more noneconomic variables thought to affect fertility (such as female educational level, urbanization, race, religion, and population density) by entering the noneconomic variables along with the indicators of capability to purchase children and cost of children in mul-

A further central weakness of all the cited studies has been the fact that all of the regression analyses have been performed on cross-sectional data. Although such analyses constitute inherently static images of the interrelationships of levels of variables, the results have been assumed to represent estimates of how the change in the level of each independent variable af-

fects change in the dependent variable. Janowitz (1973a,6) questioned the validity of drawing conclusions about how changes in variables are related to change in a dependent variable on the basis of results from cross-sectional analyses. She performed a multiple regression analysis of changes in fertility over two points in time by utilizing differences in the levels of variables from the earlier to the later point in time as measures of change. Janowitz's findingswith change data were not consistent with those of earlier cross-sectional studies of the variation of fertility among nations.
This result motivated Janowitz to conclude that the theoretical positions supported by the earlier cross-sectional studies were now lacking in meaningful verification. Although there seem to be no firm methodological grounds for assuming that cross-sectional results are inherently less valid than change analysis results (none were really provided in Janowitz's argument), Blalock (1964, p. 131) and Kasarda (1972) have concluded that more faith can be posited in a set of regression findings if the analyses have yielded the same results with both cross-sectional and change data (although they also provide no methodological argument for the superiority of one mode of analysis over the other).
Beyond the exclusive reliance on crosssectional data, a final limitation of the past studies lies in the fact that none of them, with the possible exception of Cain and Weininger (1973), have really come close to exhausting the set of noneconomic variables suspected of exerting effects on fertility. Therefore, it is highly probable that in some of them the estimates of the effects of the economic factors on fertility are biased in an unknown way (the economic variables may not have been sufficiently purged of noneconomic effects on fertility).
The goal of the present study was to

conduct a test of the economic theory of fertility which would not suffer from the limitations discussed above. Thus, the analyses presented in this paper were conducted on the same areal units at three points in time, 1950, 1960, and 1970, using cross-sectional data, and for two ten year periods, 1950-60 and 1960-70, using change data. Furthermore, all noneconomic variables shown to affect fertility in previous studies were entered into the regressions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The goal set forth for this study in the previous section necessitated the use of areal data, since no individual data collected in the past exists, as far as I know, with which to perform comparable analyses. I was able to construct measures for the various variables required in the analyses for the 48 contiguous states of the United States over the period of 1950 to 1970 from data available in the U.S. census, the National Catholic Almanac, and the statistical abstracts of the United States.
Since the economic theory of fertility has been formulated largely in terms of family decision-making processes, individual level data might be viewed as superior to aggregate data in testing the theory due to the fact that areal studies are vulnerable to the danger of the "ecological fallacy" (Robinson, 1950). However, numerous social scientists, including Heer and Boynton (1970), Hammond (1973), Cain and Weininger (1973), and Loftin and Hill (1974), have argued that areal data should be utilized in situations in which individual level data suitable for the desired analyses do not exist. Furthermore, several students of fertility have pointed out that areal-level analyses enjoy certain advantages over individual-level analyses, leading to the conclusion that

228

areal analyses should be conducted (complimentary to individual level analyses) even when appropriate individual data exist. The reader should examine Heer and Boynton (1970), Gardner (1973), and Cain and Weininger (1973) for arguments in this regard especially relevant to the study of fertility.
VARIABLES
The measure of fertility used in the analyses of this study was the rate of children ever born to ever-married women aged 20-24 (CEBM). The analyses were conducted for this age category for several reasons. First, the author judged that the rate of children ever born to this youngadult age category would most exclusively, in contrast to alternative age categories, display immediate response to concurrent levels of income of same-aged males and income available to females, since past levels of these variables could not have come into play. Second, a recent version of the economic theory of fertility has been formulated largely in terms of young adults (Easterlin, 1973). And third, particularly salient in light of the second point, no previous study I have reviewed has attempted to test the economic theory of fertility with this age category.
The independent variables used in the analyses included male income (MI, the indicator of the capability to purchase children, expressed in terms of 1967 dollars in the analyses), female income (FI, the indicator of the cost of children, also expressed in terms of 1967 dollars in the analyses), female educational level (ED), urbanization (UR), per cent Black (%B), per cent Catholic (%C), and population density (PD). Detailed explanations of the sources of data and the operationalization of each of the variables in each of the analyses follow. The reader will note that data specific to the age category were available for 20-24 year old male and

female income, education, and urbanization in the U.S. censuses for 19S0, 1960, and 1970, while age-specific data were not available for all of these points in time for per cent Black, per cent Catholic, and population density.
MALE INCOME (MI): (a) the median income of males 20-24 years old with income in 1949 for each state (U.S. Census of the Population: 1950, Table 89); (b)the same median for 1959 (U.S. Census of the Population: 1960, Table 134); (c)the same median for 1969 (U.S. Censusof thePopulation: 1970, Table 193); (d) change in male income from 19S0 to 1960 was defined as (b)~(a); and (e) change in female income from 1960 to 1970 was defined as (c)--(b). All medians were adjusted to compensate for the effects of inflation by being converted into 1967 dollars prior to the analyses.
FEMALE INCOME (FI): (a) the median income of females 20-24 years old with income in 1949 for each state (U.S. Census of the Population: 1950, Table 89); (b)the same median for 1959 (U.S. Census of the Population: 1960, Table 134); (c) the same median for 1969 (U.S. Censusof thePopulation: 1970, Table 193); (d) change in female income from 1950 to 1960 was defined as (b)--(a); and (e) change in female income from 1960 to 1970 was defined as (c)-{b). All medians were adjusted to compensate for the effects of inflation by being converted into 1967 dollars prior to the analyses. (The median income of females 20-24 years old in each state in 1960 correlated at 0.98 with the female wage rate of women 20-24 years old per state in 1960 as calculated in the manner prescribed by Cain and Weininger, 1973, p. 223.)

in children ever born to ever-married women aged 20-24 as the dependent variable. Among the independent variables, male and female income and urbanization were entered into the regressions as change variables. The use of change scores for male and female income seems a logical necessity? since the economic theory of fertility claims that changes in capability to purchase children and in the cost of children cause changes in fertility. Urbanization was included in the change analyses as a change rather than as a level variable since, in the absence of any theoretical or empirical reason for an alternative course, it seemed most logical to utilize change in an independent variable to explain change in a dependent variable. Furthermore, experimental regression analyses indicated that the initial level of urbanization (at the beginning of the period of change for which the analysis was performed) had absolutely no effect on change in fertility, while change in urbanization did.
Four of the independent variables used in the change analysis regressions, however, were entered at their initial levels at the outset of the periods, rather than as changes in levels during the periods, for the following reasons. First, population density has been viewed theoretically as an inhibitor of population growth. Thus, during the 1950-60 period (generally a period of increasing fertility, although fertility actually peaked in 1957), the population densities of the states were expected to act as differential restraining influences on fertility increase. And during the 1960-70 period of general decline in fertility, population density was expected to act as a differential facilitator of the trend. Therefore, it seemed most appropriate to use the initial level of population density in the change analyses.
Educational level, per cent Black, and per cent Catholic were included in the

change regressions as initial level rather than change scores in part because data from the National Fertility Studies of 1965 and 1970 (Ryder and Westoff, 1971; Ryder, 1973) indicated that all three of these factors were associated with inability to maintain control over fertility. Also, Cutright (1973) has shown that improved health conditions during the 1940-68 period has evidently caused an involuntary increase in the fertility of Blacks and of poorly educated people. Thus, it is likely that states with large segments of their populations poorly educated and/or Black and/or Catholic would be inclined to experience greater than average increases in fertility during the 1950-60 period and would be less capable of following the trend toward lower fertility during the 1960-70 period.
Furthermore, change in these three variables during the two ten-year periods was negatively correlated to their initial levels in five out of six cases. That is, using change in these variables would greatly misrepresent the degree to which a state's population was poorly educated, Black, or Catholic.
Finally, and perhaps most significantly, the main role of the noneconomic variables in this study was to purge the economic variables, male and female income, of contamination with the effects of noneconomic factors on fertility. In alternate exploratory regressions in which either changes or initial levels in education, per cent Black, and per cent Catholic were used, the results yielded with initial levels were in much greater agreement with theorized expectations for all variables in the analyses. Also, the amount of variation in change in fertility explained was somewhat higher.
One additional aspect of the change analyses should be explained before moving to a consideration of the results. Bohrnstedt (1969) has shown that the

amount and direction of change in a variable from one point of time to another tends to be negatively related to the level of that variable at the beginning of the period of change. That is, the higher the level of a variable at the outset of a period of time, the lower the amount of increase (or the greater the amount of decrease) in the level of the variable during the period. This tendency, long observed by students of change phenomena, may be due to an inclination to regress toward the mean or to the fact that the level of a variable at the beginning of a period might already be close to some upper or lower bound (unique to the nature of the particular variable). Thus, Bohrnstedt concluded that it is necessary to control for the initial levels of dependent variables in change analyses.
One method of accomplishing such a control within the mode of a multivariate regression analysis is the inclusion of the initial level of the dependent variable in the regression equation. Bohrnstedt (1974) considered this procedure the only plausible approach in the change analyses attempted in this study, since more than two independent variables were used in the regressions. Other potential methods for controlling for the initial-level effects on the change in a dependent variable become unmanageably complicated once there are more than two or three independent variables involved. The results of the change analyses performed in this study indicate that the procedure worked effectively and was necessary, since in both of the change regressions the initial level of the dependent variable exerted a strong independent negative effect on change in fertility (see Table 1).
RESULTS
The results of the regression analyses are presented in Table 1. The first row of the table contains the unstandarized re-

gression coefficients (b's) and the standardized regression coefficients (beta's) for the analysis which used the 19S0 cross-sectional data. The second through fifth rows of the table contain the results for the regressions which utilized change data for the 1950-60 period, cross-sectional data for 1960, change data for the 1960-70 period, and cross-sectional data for 1970, respectively.
Among the noneconomic variables used in the regressions, only education came close to being significantly related to fertility in the predicted negative direction throughout all five analyses. The relationship was statistically significant at the 0.05 level in four of the five regressions, while for the 1950-60 change analysis education seemed to have no effect. The other noneconomic variables were even less consistently related to fertility at statistically significant levels of probability. Nevertheless, since in all the analyses subsets of the noneconomic variables were related to fertility at acceptable levels of statistical significance, their inclusion in the regressions probably did purge the male and female income variables of contamination with the effects on fertility of noneconomic covariates.
Male income (the indicator of the capability to purchase children) was, as predicted by the economic theory, positively related to fertility in all five of the regressions, although statistical significance at the 0.05 level was not achieved for the 1950-60 change analysis (the probability of this finding being due to chance was less than 0.2). Female income (the indicator of the cost of children) was consistently negatively related to fertility, also in conformity with the predictions of economic theory. The relationships were all significant at the 0.05 level, except for the 1960-70 change analysis (p < 0.1). With the exception of the 1960-70 regression, the standardized regression coefficients
