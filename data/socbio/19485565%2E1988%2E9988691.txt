ABSTRACT: This paper considers whether marital instability varies by the duration between marriage and first birth among ever-married white and black American women. Analysis of data from the June 1985 Current Population Survey suggests that the duration between marriage and first birth has a generally monotonic relationship with the probability of white women separating or divorcing from their first marriage; the relationship has remained relatively constant over time. For blacks, no consistent association is found between marital dissolution and the duration between marriage and first birth. Black women having a premarital conception and postmarital birth and those having their first birth during their second year of marriage have a similarly high risk of dissolution. Conversely, blacks having their first birth 8-12 or 25-42 months after marrying have a low probability of dissolution. Possible reasons for the racial differences are discussed.

can adversely affect the course of a marriage. Furthermore, the first birth reduces the couple's time for nonfamilial activities. Since adjustments must be made after the first birth, and since the duration between marriage and first birth may affect a couple's ability to make these adjustments, the timing of the first birth could affect marital discord. For example, those having a first birth shortly after marriage have not had enough time to adjust to marriage itself before facing the additional marital strain, including economic pressure, of having a child.
The divorce rate has risen steadily from 1960 to the early 1980's; it has stabilized in the last few years (National Center for Health Statistics, 1986a). The timing of the first birth has changed significantly since 1960. For example, women have recently delayed their first birth until later in life (National Center for Health Statistics, 1986b; Bloom, 1982). The proportion of premarital births has also increased tremendously during the past 25 years (National Center for Health Statistics, 1986b; Grabill, 1976). These changes may have altered the relationship between the timing of the first birth and marital instability. By analyzing the data by marriage cohort, it is possible to identify any changes in the relationship between the timing of the first birth and marital instability.
It may be hypothesized that childless women, delayed childbearers, and those premaritally pregnant are more likely to divorce or separate than others. However, different factors are responsible for their greater tendency to divorce. For example, delayed childbearers often establish a career before beginning childbearing and thus their greater finances may remove a major obstacle (i.e., financial security) preventing di-

vorce. Additionally, the occurrence of a first birth this long after marriage may be the result of severe pressure placed on one of the spouses to have children, thus producing marital discord. Childless women, more so than delayed childbearers, are often financially secure career women who do not have the economic pressures to stay in a marriage. Additionally, their emphasis on a career in the work force may produce marital strain.
Women with a premarital birth may be limited in their search for an acceptable spouse (Becker et al., 1977), which may result in greater marital instability. Because a relatively small percentage of husbands are the biological fathers of their wives' premaritally conceived first birth, the husbands may have less emotional ties to these children. Women having a premarital conception and postmarital birth (1-7 months after marriage) are generally "forced" into marriage earlier than desired and before they are emotionally or psychologically prepared for this type of commitment. The couple also has had little time to develop strong interpersonal ties or become financially secure before the arrival of this child, thus increasing their risk of marital disruption.
Conversely, a longer first birth interval may promote marital stability by giving the couple time to adjust to marriage and develop strong interpersonal ties before the arrival of the child. Likewise, waiting a few years after marriage to begin childbearing allows the couple time to acquire the finances necessary to rear a child and thus reduce marital tension that is brought on by economic pressure.

which is a probability sample survey selected to represent the civilian noninstitutionalized population of the United States living in households. The primary purpose of the Current Population Survey is to provide monthly labor force estimates of the population. Additionally, the June 1985 survey contained supplementary questions on marital and fertility history. It is the supplemental questions that provide the basic data of the study.
The study population consists of 22,977 ever-married white and black women whose first marriage occurred between 1960-84 and before the age of 36. Because the study focuses on the timing of the first birth in relation to date of marriage, it is necessary to exclude those women with relatively little time remaining after marriage for childbearing. Only 2 per cent of the women married after age 35, and thus their exclusion should have no significant effect on the results. The timing of the first birth is measured by the first birth interval and marital instability is measured by both separation and divorce. First birth interval is defined as the duration from first marriage to first birth, with first births occurring before marriage and no births forming separate categories of this variable. The analysis focuses on the probability of separation and divorce for a woman's first marriage. Results are expressed as the cumulative proportion of women separating or divorcing within t months of their date of marriage. The analysis is done separately for white and black women. To assess any changes in the relationship between the first birth interval and marital instability, we examine the data separately by marriage cohort.
Life table analysis is used to estimate the proportion of women separating or

divorcing within specified times after becoming married. Because data from the June 1985 Current Population Survey are cross-sectional, the extent to which currently married women with spouse present may separate or divorce is unknown. To minimize the problems associated with truncated marriage intervals, the life table method, based on analysis of open and closed intervals, is used to determine the probability of separation and divorce.
There is one limitation, inherent when studying the timing of the first birth and marital instability, that warrants discussion. Basically, because marital instability may cause delayed childbearing (childlessness) or vice versa, it is hard to interpret an observed association between marital instability and childlessness (or delayed childbearing). However, examining the pattern between the timing of the first birth and marital instability within 25 years after marriage makes it possible to infer which variable has the primary causal impact since one can observe whether the association varies by duration of marriage. It is expected that the effect of marital instability on delaying childbearing should vary by duration of marriage and be greatest during the first few years of marriage. As marital duration increases, so does the probability of the occurrence of the first birth, thus reducing the likelihood of a positive impact of the presence of marital tension on delays in the timing of the first birth. The possibility of marital instability affecting the timing of the first birth is negligible among those first birth interval categories occurring near the date of marriage (e.g., 1-7 or 8-12 months after marriage). Consequently, the results of this study should provide useful information on the effect of the timing of the first

birth on marital instability despite the limitations inherent in the analysis.
RESULTS
In the discussion that follows, results are presented first for divorce then for separation. The data are tabulated separately by race with more detailed analyses done for whites, owing to their much larger sample size.
DIVORCE
The proportion of women divorcing by duration between marriage and first birth, marriage cohort, and duration of marriage is shown in Tables 1 and 2. Overall results indicate that black and white women have a similar probability of divorce during the first eight years of marriage; at longer durations, blacks are slightly more likely to divorce. The probability of divorce after 25 years of marriage is 0.434 for blacks and 0.408 for whites.
Black women are grouped into two marriage cohorts: those marrying 196072 and 1973-84. The probability of divorce is greater for those marrying after 1972. For white women, there are five marriage cohorts: those marrying 196064, 1965-69, 1970-74, 1975-79, and 1980-84. It is quite clear that at similar durations after marriage the probability of divorce is greater with each succeeding marriage cohort through 1975-79. The pattern reverses itself, however, since those married between 1980-84 are less likely to divorce during the first five years of marriage than those married between 1975-79. Although the results for the 1980-84 cohort are preliminary, they do support previous research indicating a recent stability and slight reduction in the divorce rate (National Center for Health Statistics, 1986a).

The timing of the first birth varies by race. For example, 20.1 per cent of white women and 53.1 per cent of black women have a premaritally conceived first birth. White women, on average, have a longer duration between marriage and first birth. Additionally, a greater percentage of white women are childless than blacks (19.5 per cent to 12.7 per cent).
For white women, an inverse relationship is found between first birth interval and the probability of divorce among those having their first birth within 36 months after marrying, including premarital births. However, the pattern reverses itself for those waiting more than 54 months after marriage to have their first birth. Childless women or those having their first birth premaritally are the most likely to divorce, regardless of the duration of marriage.
Because of the smaller sample size for blacks, those having their first birth more than 24 months after marrying are grouped into two categories compared to three categories for whites. Similar to the results for whites, blacks having their first birth 8-12 or 25-42 months after marriage have a low probability of divorce. Those having their first birth the longest after marrying are also more likely to divorce than those in the preceding category. Furthermore, at short durations after marriage these women are the most likely to divorce, though they have a relatively low probability of eventually divorcing. A major difference between the races is that there is no consistent monotonic relationship between the timing of the first birth after marriage and the probability of divorce for blacks. The large probability of divorce for blacks having their first birth 13-24 months after marriage interrupts any possible monotonic association and

is puzzling. Another racial difference is that, among blacks, those having their first birth 1-7 months after marrying have a greater probability of divorce than childless women or those with a premarital birth. That is, because it is very common for blacks to have children out-of-wedlock, its effect on the probability of divorce may be less than that found when women are "forced" into marriage by a pregnancy.
To determine any recent changes in divorce patterns by birth interval, the data are analyzed separately by marriage cohort. The proportion of white women divorcing within specified durations after marriage, by first birth interval, and marriage cohort is shown in Table 3. Among white women married before 1975, an inverse association is found between the probability of divorce and the first birth interval for those having their first birth within 54 months after marriage, including premarital births. The association is not always monotonic. Similar to the overall findings, the probability of divorce increases substantially for those waiting at least 55 months after marriage to have their first birth.
Similar to the two previous marriage cohorts, among those married between 1975-79, childless women have the greatest probability of divorce followed by those with a premarital birth, and those having their first birth 1-7 months after marrying. The pattern differs, however, for those having their first birth between 8 and 54 months after marriage since these women generally have a similar likelihood of divorcing. Again, those waiting the longest after marriage to begin childbearing are more likely to divorce than these women.
Data are available for only five years for those married between 1980-84.

These preliminary results show an inverse association between the probability of divorce and the first birth interval for those having their first birth within 36 months after marriage, including premarital births.
Regardless of the marriage cohort, childless women or those having their firstbirth premaritally have a high probability of divorce, and those women having their first birth 25-54 months after marriage have a low probability of divorce. Among those having a postmarital conception, an inverse association generally exists between divorce and the first birth interval, though the pattern changes for women having their first birth the longest after marriage. Little evidence is found of a convergence in the relationship between the timing of the first birth and the probability of divorce suggests that this pattern will continue. The stable relationship between timing of first birth and probability of divorce for the last 25 years (suggests that this pattern will continue).
The proportion of black women divorcing by first birth interval and marriagecohort is shown in Table 4. Results indicate that among comparable women, those married 1973-84 are generally more likely to divorce. Among both marriage cohorts no consistent monotonic relationship is found between the timing of the first birth and divorce. However, certain patterns of divorce are clearly evident. For example, those women having their first birth 1-7 months or greater than 42 months after marriage have a high probability of divorce during the first 10 years of marriage. Conversely, childless women and those having their first birth premaritally or between 8-12 and 25-42 months after marriage have a much lower probability of divorce for the first ten years of

marriage. The only significant difference in the pattern of divorce by marriage cohort is found for those having their first birth between 13-24 months after marriage. That is, among those married 1960-72, these women are the most likely to divorce, whereas among those married after 1972, they have a relatively low probability of divorce, especially during the first five years of marriage.
Contrary to the results for whites, blacks who are premaritally pregnant but chose to marry before their child's birth are more likely to divorce than those with a premarital birth. Consequently, the effect of being "forced" into marriage by a pregnancy on marital instability may vary by race. Black women having their first birth the longest after marriage are much more likely to divorce during the first ten years of marriage but much less likely to divorce eventually than other women. This finding suggests that while it is possible that marital dissolution may be partially responsible for the delaying of childbearing, it appears that among those who are married and delay the first birth the longest, their probability of divorce is low.
SEPARATION
Marital instability may be measured by separation as well as divorce. Although separation usually results in divorce, some couples do reconcile whereas others remain permanently separated. Furthermore, the duration between separation and divorce varies tremendously by race with the average duration much longer for'blacks than whites (McCarthy, 1978). Consequently, it is prudent to examine the pat-

tern of separation by the duration between marriage and first birth.
Like divorce, life table analysis is used to estimate the probability of separation by first birth interval. Results are not presented in tables, however, since the patterns are very similar for both separation and divorce. Rather, only the major findings are discussed.
Although black women are only slightly more likely to divorce by 25 years after marriage than white women (0.434 to 0.408), they are much more likely to separate (0.597 to 0.427). It is also quite clear that the differential probability of divorce and separation is much greater for blacks. Among white women, the patterns of separation by first birth interval are relatively similar for each marriage cohort. That is, an inverse relationship generally exists between the timing of the first birth and the probability of separation among those women having their first birth within 36 months after marrying (including premarital births). Women having their first birth premaritally generally are the most likely to separate. For each marital duration, women waiting the longest after marriage to begin childbearing are more likely to separate than women having their first birth 8-54 months after marrying, but are less likely to separate than women in the other first birth interval categories. It is quite evident that the pattern of separation by first birth interval is similar to that found for divorce. The only difference, albeit minor, between the findings for separation and divorce is that the inverse relationship found among various first birth interval categories and marital instability is slightly more consistent for separation.
Like the findings for whites, the pattern of separation by first birth interval

for blacks is similar to that found for divorce. Specifically, results show no evidence of a consistent monotonic relationship between the timing of the first birth and the probability of separation for women married 1960-72. Among women married after 1972, an inverse association is found among women having their first birth 8-42 months after marriage. As with divorce, women having their first birth 13-24 months after marriage have the greatest probability of separation among those married 1960-72, but are not likely to separate among those married after 1972. Minor differences are found in the patterns for separation and divorce. Women married 1960-72 who have their first birth 25-42 months after marrying have a high probability of separation but a low probability of divorce, relative to others. Among women married 1973-84, those having their first birth 8-12 months after marrying have a high probability of separation but are not very likely to divorce.
CONCLUSION
Using data from the June 1985 Current Population Survey, this study has examined whether marital instability varies by the duration between marriage and first birth among ever-married white and black women married 196084. The analysis focused on whether or not a woman was separated or divorced from her first marriage. The findings were similar for both divorce and separation, suggesting that either measure may be used as an indicator of marital instability without sacrificing accuracy.
The relationship between the first birth interval and marital instability was

quite different for white and black women. For white women an inverse association was generally found between marital instability and first birth interval. It thus appears that women who have longer to adjust to marriage before beginning childbearing are more likely to remain married than those with little time to adjust to marriage before the arrival of a child. However, those having their first birth more than 54 months after marriage were consistently more likely to separate and divorce than those having their first birth 8-54 months after marrying, regardless of the marital duration.
Among blacks there was little evidence of a monotonic association between first birth interval and marital instability. However, certain patterns were found. Among both marriage cohorts, women with a premarital conception but postmarital birth were likely to separate and divorce whereas women having their first birth 25-42 months after marriage had a low probability of marital instability. A puzzling finding requiring further research was that for women having their first birth 13-24 months after marriage there was a high risk of marital disruption for those married 1960-72, but a low risk for those married after 1972, relative to others in their marriage cohort.
There are additional racial differences besides the finding that the longer the duration between marriage andfirst birth the better the chances for marital stability among whites, but not blacks. For example, childless women and those with premarital births generally had the greatest probability of marital disruption for whites, whereas for blacks the highest probability was for those with a premarital conception and a

postmarital birth. It is possible that these differences occur because blacks view the first birth and marriage differently than whites. That is, because blacks are much more likely to have premarital births and to have a shorter duration between marriage and first birth, blacks and whites in the same first birth interval category may be dissimilar and have different values resulting in a differential effect of the timing of the first birth on marital instability by race.
Among both races the association between the first birth interval and marital instability varied little by marriage cohort. The fact that recent changes in marital disruption and the timing of the first birth have not altered this pattern implies that the relationship should continue. That is, among whites, childless women and those premaritally pregnant may be expected to have an increased risk of marital instability whereas those waiting a couple years after marriage to begin childbearing may be expected to have a decreased risk of marital instability. For black women certain first birth interval categories are expected to continue to be associated with a high and low risk of marital instability though the pattern is not monotonic.
Although the duration between marriage and first birth was related to marital instability for both races, caution is needed when interpreting the pattern of association between delayed childbearing (and to a lesser extent, births occur-

ring a few years after marriage) and marital instability. Because the association between first birth interval and both separation and divorce for whites was similar at each duration of marriage, it is reasonable to assume that marital instability had little effect on delaying childbearing since otherwise the relationship should have varied by duration of marriage. That is, marital instability is expected to have its strongest effect on the timing of the first birth during the first few years of marriage. Indeed, marital instability may be partially responsible for the delaying of childbearing among blacks. However, black women who delay their first birth but are married at this birth appear to have a relatively low risk of separating or divorcing. Information from this study is useful and can give insight as to the effect of the first birth interval on marital instability provided one understands the limitations of the study.
This study may be viewed as exploratory with the results suggesting that the duration between marriage and first birth is indeed related to marital disruption, though its effect varies by race. The next step is to determine whether the pattern of association remains while controlling for those factors that may affect marital instability. Additionally, more research is needed to accurately determine how delayed childbearing affects separation and divorce, and to separate out their reciprocal causal effects.
