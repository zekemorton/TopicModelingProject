ABSTRACT: During 1985-91, Latin American ministries of health carried out the ultimately successful Regional Polio Eradication Initiative. Unprecedented vaccine coverage levels were attained through a combination of mass campaigns, house-to-house vaccinations, and improvements in routine immunization services. Little is known, however, about the effects of these interventions on immunization demand; whether they reached so-called high-risk households and, if so, whether program effects were sufficient to offset the household risk factors. This paper examines the probability and timing of full immunization over this period in one case country, Colombia. Information on the immunization status of 3,609 vaccine-eligible children born 1985-90 was extracted from Colombia's 1990Demographic and Health Survey. Annual immunization coverage estimates from the Colombian Ministry of Health for 1985-90 for 148 sample municipios were appended to each child record, along with household-level data. Initial nonparametric regressions showed that five of six observed risk factors negatively influenced full immunization probability. Multivariate logit models showed that parents who had already lost a child were significantly less likely to obtain immunization cards (a proxy for exposure to the routine immunization program), despite rising cardholdership rates over the period. Among 1,376 immunization cardholders, waiting times to full immunization fell monotonically over theperiod. Local program coverage of 80 per cent or higher and prior use of prenatal services both increased the probability of full immunization. However, three of five maternal occupational categories decreased the probability, as did three of six observed household risk factors. The results show that demand for routine immunizations rose over the period, that only the highest-risk households were not exposed to the routine program, and that routine program participation partially offset negative risk factor effects on the probability of full immunization. While targeted PHCinterventions mayincrease health production by recruiting high-risk households into the routine PHCservices, further health production increases will require more intensive followup of such households through routine PHCservices.

Mortality and fertility rates have fallen faster in Latin America in recent decades than anywhere else in the developing world (Hill and Pebley, 1989; McNicoll, 1992; Sullivan, 1991). This rapid transition, many argue, has been propelled more by public health programs than by improvements in living standards (Preston, 1985; Bahr and Wehrhahn, 1993). Well before the 1978 Alma-Ata Conference, comprehensive primary health care (PHC) services, including

immunizations, growth monitoring, prenatal care, health education, inexpensive treatment for common illnesses, and environmental monitoring had been available to the majority of the region's households (PAHO, 1990). In certain areas, however, utilization of those services has lagged, despite various outreach and promotional efforts by health workers (Lechtig et al., 1983; Askew, 1988; WHO, 1991; Mora andYunes, 1993).

To maximize health impacts, Latin American health policymakers began emphasizing a smaller set of specific PHC programs in the 1980's, including the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI), programs for the control of diarrheal and acute respiratory diseases, nutritional monitoring and, more recently, maternal health (Walsh and Warren, 1979; Grant, 1991; Chelala, 1992). In the past decade, governments and donor agencies alike have spent unprecedented amounts on these specific PHC programs. An example was the Regional Polio Eradication Initiative launched in 1985 through the Pan American Health Organization Regional EPI Program. At the onset of the polio effort, routine immunization services were accessible to at least 70 per cent of the region's families but coverage levels hovered around 50 per cent (de Quadros et al., 1991). As the eradication effort progressed, ministries of health began continuously monitoring the percentage of children fully immunized down to the municipio level, enabling them to target inputs to high-risk areas. Over half of the region's approximately 10,000 municipios had passed the 75 per cent coverage mark by 1988, but a small proportion--around 500 mostly low-income urban communities--had not yet reached 50 per cent coverage. By 1991 special "mop-up" teams of house-to-house vaccinators had pushed up coverage levels to over 75 per cent in these laggard municipios as well (MMWR, 1994). Regional polio eradication was formally certified in October 1994.
A recent six-country evaluation found that the Regional Polio Effort had strengthened delivery capacities for routine immunization services and other PHC programs (PAHO, 1995). The evalu-

ation, however, did not address household demand for routine PHC services. It seems likely that such a large-scale sustained intervention affected at least immunization demand (Wright, 1995). Immunization demand might rise for several reasons: parents' heightened awareness of the need; increased availability and quality of PHC services; increased income and changes in other household constraints; sanctions and other social effects. A positive program treatment effect would make parents more likely to complete the immunization schedule because they understand the importance of disease prevention and have rearranged their preferences accordingly. The polio initiative has been criticized for emphasizing expediency over the latter (Nichter, 1995; Wright, 1995). Of particular interest is whether or not immunization demand increased uniformly across various socioeconomic strata and risk groups (Nichter, 1995).
In this paper we examine immunization demand over the period 1985-90 in Colombia, one of the six countries evaluated by PAHO and one of the last to eliminate polio. Data provided by the Colombian Ministry of Health show that the proportions of children under age one who had received at least three doses of polio vaccine rose monotonically over the period 1983-90 (Table 1). Householdlevel immunization data reported in Colombia's 1986 and 1990 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), summarized in Table 2, suggest that coverage rose for children ages 12-23 months, that the mean age of full immunization declined over the interval, but that the proportion of children with immunization cards did not increase. A direct comparison of full immunization probabilities cannot be

and the parents were referred to the routine services to obtain cards. In order to attain full immunization status, a child needed to receive a fourth antigen, BCG vaccine, which was only administered through the routine services. Thus, attendance at temporary posts may have induced some parents to obtain cards later through the routine services. However, attaining full immunization status required at least one contact with the routine services. Accordingly, we model cardholdership as an indicator of some degree of routine program exposure. We further assume that parents' health-seeking behaviors and preferences would most likely be changed by repeated contact with routine PHC providers; less so, by participation in the campaigns (Loevinsohn and Loevinsohn, 1987).
The research problem is also complicated from a methodological viewpoint. Parents with high health-producing propensities would be most likely both to utilize the routine program and to complete their children's immunization schedules. To infer a program effect on immunization outcomes would be spurious in such a case (Maddala, 1983). Negative selection may also have occurred, for very different reasons. Among the noncardholders might have been better-off parents who opt to obtain immunizations and other PHC services from private providers.
Among the noncardholders might also have been a relatively small number of highest-risk parents who most resist the routine program. Recent studies have shown that as few as 6 per cent of households produce as much as two-thirds of infant and child mortality in some developing areas (Das Gupta, 1990; Desai, 1992; Curtis et al., 1993; Guo, 1993). A range of household-level mortality risk

correlates have been identified, some of which we model below. Of potentially greater import, however, are the unobserved causes of low "maternal competence" (Das Gupta, 1990). Given that immunization is an important proximate determinant of infant and childhood mortality, one would expect so-called "highrisk" households to be among the least likely to have cards or fully immunized children (Rutstein et al., 1990; Mosley and Chen, 1984).
Also, the fluid immunization regime itself violates standard statistical assumptions. As described above, greater program effort was focused on certain municipios, which tended to be relatively poorer. High-risk households might have been overrepresented in these more refractory municipios. This nonindependence of program effort and client characteristics could produce inconsistent parameter estimates due to endogeneity bias (Rosenzweig and Wolpin, 1986). Such a program endogeneity bias might cause underestimation of the true effects of observed risk covariates.
Clustering bias is another threat to external validity. The dataset we use contains observations on siblings within households. Unmeasured household-level factors would affect them equally, biasing downward the standard error estimates for observed covariates. In sum, simply comparing the conditional probabilities of full immunization of cardholders to noncardholders could be misleading.
With the above in mind, we investigate three issues in this paper: (1) Did Colombia's changing immunization regime recruit high-risk households into the ranks of regular immunization service users or did it merely reach them through the periodic campaigns? (2) Once recruited, were

metropolitan area residence, mother's union status, and prior use of prenatal services. At the community level we use administrative estimates of local vaccine (OPV3) coverage levels as a control for local immunization program effort.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
MODEL SPECIFICATION
DEPENDENT VARIABLES
We examine household- and community-level determinants of three individual immunization outcomes: immunization cardholdership, immunization status, and the waiting times to full immunization. A child is classified as a cardholder if her immunization card was seen by an interviewer. Full immunization status is our dichotomous measure of whether or not a child has received the correct number of doses of all four WHOrecommended antigens (one dose of BCG, three doses of DPT, three doses of OPV, and one dose of measles). The waiting times, in months, indicate how long it took parents to fully immunize an index child with exposure starting at 9 months of age, the minimal age at which WHO recommends the last antigen, measles, be administered.
INDEPENDENT VARIABLES
We incorporate six observed health risk covariates as predictors in our models: maternal age less than 20 years, no formal maternal education, female household headship, no toilet in the household, preceding birth interval less than 25 months, and a history of a prior child death. We also include household-level controls for maternal occupation, number of living children, metropolitan vs. non-

CAUSAL FRAMEWORK
We adapt the household production of health model, considering immunization as a specific input to a more general household health production function (Schultz, 1984; DaVanzo and Gertler, 1990; Akin et al., 1992). Subject to income and other constraints, parents choose immunizations over other behavioral alternatives in order to maximize the utility a healthy child affords them. Under an optimally efficient household health production function, a child is fully immunized at the lowest possible age--9 months--thereby minimizing exposure to the target vaccine-preventible diseases. The efficiency of a production function is affected by both cost and socioeconomic factors. A positive treatment effect would increase the efficiency of a household health production function, resulting in higher probabilities of complete immunization and shorter waiting times among routine program users. The mechanism for this effect might be endogenous (causing parents to reorder preferences) or exogenous (reducing the time and other costs or adding incentives to obtain immunizations). For high-risk households a strong treatment effect might offset the negative effects of the observed high-risk predictors.
In our application of the household production of health approach, immunization utilization is modeled as an endogenous process in which parents first obtain cards, then either do or do not go

on to complete their child's immunization. Their propensity to do either is a function of an unobservable health-seeking variable. A positive shift in this variable could have been caused by improvements in local PHC program effort, better information, cognitive change and/or endogenous social effects (Manski, 1994). Thus, a strong program effect would reduce the variation in both immunization cardholdership and full immunization status across socioeconomic strata and risk groups. Secondly, the hazard of full immunization would be similar among cardholders regardless of observed risk status.
The local supply of immunizations may also affect individual outcomes. To control for this possibility we include in our models an independent contextual measure for local immunization program performance: the Colombian Ministry of Health's estimates of the percentage of children below age 2 years who had received their third doses of polio vaccine (OPV3) in each sample municipio for each of the years 1985-90.
METHODS
Because we are uncertain about the process generating the observed immunization outcomes we begin our analysis in conservative fashion by examining the data nonparametrically for evidence of a program treatment effect. We use the BOUNDS program (Manski and Shen, 1993) to regress the probability of full immunization on each of the six dichotomous risk status covariates, stratifying by cardholdership. By the law of total probability, the treatment effect can be bounded nonparametrically:
P[Y(T)=1X,Z=l]*P(Z=l\X)P[Y(N)=\ X,Z=0]*P(Z=0|X)-

P(Z=l\X)<P[Y(T)\X] - P[Y(N)\X]< P[Y(T) = l\X,Z=l]*P(Z=l\X)+
P(Z=0\X) -P[Y(N)= 1 |X,Z=0]*P(Z=0)
where
Y(T)=probability of full immunization for cardholders;
Y(N) = probability of full immunization for noncardholders;
X= observed risk covariates; Z=a dummy variable indicating card-
holdership.
Numerical limitations requires us to select first a 50 per cent random sample of the dataset. We then stratify the sample into the twelve subsamples. Using the kernel method, we estimate bootstrap probability bounds for full immunization for pseudosamples from each stratum, assuming exogenous (random) selection (Manski and Shen, 1993). Should the bounds fail to overlap for any given risk status covariate, controlling for cardholdership, or for cardholders versus noncardholders with the same risk status, the empirical distributions can be said to differ significantly. If the probability bounds for high-risk strata are lower than those for low-risk strata among noncardholders, but do not differ significantly among cardholders, we have necessary but not sufficient evidence of a treatment effect.
CARDHOLDERSHIP
The nonparametric regressions show unbiased correlations between selected covariates and full immunization probability, conditional on cardholdership. Cardholdership, however, is treated as a random process--clearly an unrealistic assumption. On the other hand, a truly successful program might have convinced

46

even the most resistant parents to obtain cards. To examine the selectivity of cardholdership, we estimate a direct effects logit model of the form:
where
Y = 1 if child's card was seen, 0 if otherwise,
oc = a constant, Xy = a vector of household-level
covariates, P! = a vector of parameters for those
covariates,

the hazard functions of children from high-risk and low-risk households over time would provide further evidence that exposure to the routine services changed behaviors of both risk groups. If local immunization program coverage levels increase the hazard of full immunization, another necessary but not sufficient condition for inferring a positive treatment effect will be met.
To examine timing to full immunization among cardholders we estimate a twostate, continuous-time, piecewise hazard model using standard maximum likelihood procedures.1 The model takes the form:
X2(t)B2)

x2 = a vector of 1990 vaccine coverage estimates,
P2 = a vector of parameters for the coverage effect.
If the effects of the risk covariates in Pj are negative and significant, this is evidence that households less-at-risk were differently recruited into the routine program. If P2 is significant, then local immunization supply affects cardholdership over and above household-level factors.
For reasons described earlier, these logit model results may be both biased and inconsistent. To control for one potential source of bias, that due to clustering, we subset only siblings and fit robust variance estimates for the observed covariates using Huber estimators (StataCorp, 1997).
HAZARD MODELS
A monotonic decrease in waiting times to full immunization across successive cohorts would be compatible with a positive program effect. A convergence in

parameters, a vector of fixed household and individual covariates, X2 = a vector of time-varying local coverage estimates.
We measure exposure to the hazard of full immunization in months. Each "piece" in the model corresponds to some segment of the waiting time distribution. The segment 1-3 months, for instance, captures the baseline hazard for children immunized between ages 9-11 months. The hazard of full immunization within each piece is assumed to be constant. Based on preliminary results (not shown), we col-

lapsed the duration structure from 68 to only 10 segments.
In the logit model, our communitylevel proxy for vaccine supply consists of a point estimate for 1990, the year the DHS data were collected. In the hazard models, we reparameterize this measure as a time-varying covariate so that a child aged 5 in 1990 would have five different local coverage values, one for each year of exposure. Further exploration revealed that one fixed covariate, use of prenatal services, interacted significantly with duration of exposure. The model we report includes these interactions.
In hazard models the risks of censoring and of failure may be correlated across some individuals due to clustering, endogeneity, frailty, or other forms of omitted variable bias. Not accounting for the duration dependence caused by these sources of unobserved heterogeneity could seriously bias coefficient estimates and could lead to misinterpretation of the duration dependence structure (Heckman and Singer, 1982; Vaupel and Yashin, 1985). Following Heckman and Singer (1982) we test for duration dependence and purge its biasing effects using nonparametric techniques. Even when unobserved heterogeneity is controlled, the functional form imposed on the hazard may also bias parameter estimates (Trussell and Richards, 1985). To test for this distributional sensitivity we compare our directeffects piecewise exponential model using Gompertz and Cox nonparametric proportional hazard specifications. We then re-run the Gompertz model with unobserved heterogeneity controlled using the HeckmanSinger (1982) random effects approach.
DATA
Colombia's DHS II survey obtained detailed data for 8,644 reproductive-age

women and their 4,215 surviving children born between January 1985 and September 1990. Included are several household health-risk variables as well as immunization data for the 42 per cent of children whose immunization cards were seen by interviewers (Table 3). To each of the individual child health records we attached the corresponding data from the DHS household module and the vector of local coverage estimates beginning with the value obtaining in the year that child reached 9 months of age. We then categorized the continuous coverage measure using quartiles as cutpoints.
The survey contained information on immunization status and cardholdership for each of 4,130 children below age 5. Of these, 1,775 (43 per cent) reported never having had cards and 389 (9 per cent) reported they had lost the cards. For cardholding children, we computed durations, in months, beginning at age nine months to the date of the survey (exposure) and to the date on which each of four immunizations (BCG, DPT3, OPV3, and measles) was administered. We used the longest of these durations to represent the waiting time to full immunization for children who had received all four antigens. Those missing one or more immunizations we censored at the time of the survey. In cleaning the data we rejected 44 cases for whom we could not impute dates and 17 cases for whom card status could not be determined. Additionally, there were missing value codes for 167 of 783 incompletely immunized children (21 per cent) wherein a date was not entered or the mother reported an immunization not noted on the card. These we censored at the longest computable duration.
Matches of ministry and DHS data were made for 122 of the 148 municipios

containing the 754 sample clusters. For the remaining unmatched DHS municipios we assigned the coverage data from the ministry's next largest reporting units (departmentos). On average, there were 25 sample children born on or after January 1985 in each municipio and about six per sample cluster. Six municipios, representing 17 per cent of the total children in the sample, had system-missing or zero reported coverage values for at least one of the five years. Correspondence with the Colombian Ministry of Health established that the system-missing values referred to municipios where regular immunization services were not operating that year while the zeroes referred to years where municipios which should have reported their coverage failed to do so. Rather than impute values, we created and later estimated a separate category for these nonreporters.
Based on frequency distributions we categorized household variables of interest, computed preceding and following birth intervals and created an annual birth cohort variable. We next eliminated children below nine months of age who, according to WHO and ministry norms, were too young to be fully immunized. We also dropped 24 cases whose previous birth intervals were coded zero. These, presumably, were twins. The final dataset thus contained 3,609 child records with information on immunization status, cardholdership, fixed and time-dependent covariates, and local immunization program performance. By either card or recall, 2,687 (74.5 per cent) of the children were fully immunized. Additionally, exposure times, state, and censoring codes were computed for 1,376 children with immunization cards, of whom 1,038 (75.3 per cent) were fully immunized.

RESULTS
NONPARAMETRIC BOUNDS
In Table 4, we report 5, 50, and 95 per cent bootstrap quantiles for full immunization probabilities among cardholders and noncardholders for each of six risk status covariates. For each stratum we set bandwidths for the kernels at 1/10 of the standard errors of each of the six covariates (Manski and Shen, 1993). The bandwidths are represented by the variable lambda in Table 4. The numbers of observations in each stratum are indicated in parentheses. We found that 100 iterations were sufficient to generate stable estimates for each stratum. For five of the six risk covariates, noncardholding children were significantly less likely to be fully immunized than those whose parents presented cards to the interviewers. Among noncardholders, the bounds for all risk variables except female headship did not overlap with their respective reference categories. This finding indicates that immunization probabilities for children from noncardholding households with these risk factors were significantly lower. Among cardholders, in contrast, the bounds do overlap for each risk variable, indicating no significant differences. Either a true positive program treatment effect or selfselection of the lesser-at-risk into the routine program could explain this pattern.
LOGIT MODELS
Our multivariate models revealed more about the processes underlying immunization behavior. Table 5 shows that low maternal age, high parity, lack of any union, and a prior child death all significantly reduced the log-odds of cardholdership. Families with these risk factors remained less likely to participate in the

routine program, despite the intensifying immunization regime. A mother employed in a relatively high-status occupation had more difficulty obtaining a card than did a mother not working in the paid labor force. Interestingly, mothers in manufacturing jobs were 31 per cent more likely than nonemployed mothers to have cards. Strong positive cohort effects all but overshadowed the other fixed covariate effects. The likelihood of a child born in 1989 having a card was nearly three times that of a child born before 1987, despite the

child's much shorter period of exposure. Local vaccine coverage levels for 1990 had no significant effect on the likelihood of cardholdership.
Table 6 shows analogous regression results when only households with two or more siblings below age five are modelled. In the conventional model, with clustering bias as yet unpurged, the previously negative effects of low maternal age and high parity disappear while those of no union, a previous child death, and professional employment remain significantly

Additionally, female headship becomes significantly negative while previous prenatal use and high local immunization coverage become positive predictors of cardholdership. Implementing the Huber correction increases the standard errors for all but the age-cohort coefficients. The

strong cohort effects persist. However, both the occupational effects and the positive effects of prenatal use and high local program coverage become insignificant when household-level clustering is controlled. Among the observed risk predictors, only a prior child death remains significant.

HAZARD MODELS
To check the correspondence between Ministry of Health and DHS II data, we estimated the hazard of full immunization for all 1,376 cardholding children ages 9-62 months using annual birth cohorts as strata (Figure 1). Kaplan-Maier estimates (not shown) showed that waiting

times to full immunization across the strata were not homogenous by either log-rank or Wilcoxon tests. We concluded that waiting times indeed fell monotonically over the period. A plot of the conditional hazard function for all cardholding children shows that the risk of full immunization rose sharply until age 15 months, then declined monotonically (Figure 2).

the period. These gains however were not uniform across risk groups.
The nonparametric regressions showed that cardholdership effectively offset the negative effects of all but one observed household mortality risk factor on the probability of full immunization. These results do not speak to potential selection and endogeneity biases, and they incorporate the unrealistic assumption of random assignment to either cardholder (treatment) or noncardholder (control) status. The logit results suggest that the rising force of the immunization effort converted all but the highest-risk households--those with histories of child mortality--into routine immunization service users. This finding is compatible with that of Curtis et al. (1993) who showed that infant mortality risk was clustered among mothers who had previously lost children in Northeast Brazil. For such mothers the psychic costs of dealing with health care providers or of "publicizing" these earlier traumas may well exceed any offsetting wealth or cognitive effects (Coreil et al., 1994; Berman et al., 1994). The logit model results, however, are not entirely unambiguous. While the Huber regression removes household clustering bias, it does so at the price of discarding information on the majority of households. This loss of statistical power may partly explain why only one of five risk factors significant in Table 5 remains significant in Table 6.
Recall that we classified the 9 per cent of parents who reported lost cards as noncardholders. If the propensity of this group to obtain immunization cards was in fact lower than that of cardholders, then the risk factor coefficients in both nonparametric and logit models would be biased downward by our criterion. They would be unbiased, however, if the processes of ob-

taining a card and losing a card are independent.
In the hazard model for full immunization, controlling for unobserved heterogeneity removes a downward bias on the baseline hazard as well as upward biases on the observed risk covariates. Thus, the corrected hazard for "low-risk" households increases over time while the effects of the risk factors for "high-risk" households become more negative. The rising failure rates, argue Trussell and Richards (1985), signify substantive changes over time rather than heterogeneity across individuals. In other words, increasing program effort and/or behavioral changes explain the rising hazard as opposed to compositional changes in the risk set over time. Most importantly, the regression coefficients in the hazard model are consistent under varying specifications.
None of our methods, however, removed all potential sources of bias. If better-endowed families indeed opted for private PHC providers, then the observed risk status of those in the hazard model risk set would be biased downward; the reverse would be true if the riskiest of families avoided the program. The true program effect would be underestimated in the first case and overestimated in the second.
Our results also show that the effects of maternal employment on immunization uptake vary considerably by occupation. Relative to mothers not in the paid work force, mothers in higher-status occupations found it costlier to obtain cards. Once they did so, mothers working in the professional, services and manufacturing sectors took longer to complete the immunization schedule than did mothers working only at home. This pattern accords with standard microeconomic models of the family, wherein time and other re-

sources are allocated according to the value of each members' time (Becker, 1965; Grossman, 1972a, 1912b). The negative employment effects, however, do not increase monotonically with occupational prestige, suggesting that job autonomy rather than opportunity costs may be the more salient constraint among the lower-status occupations. Rosenberg (1982) documented the lax enforcement of childcare, breastfeeding, and other regulations protecting mothers working in manufacturing firms in Bogota. As with the household risk factors, the rising force of the immunization program and secular behavioral changes could not entirely overcome these institutional differentials.
The inclusion of contextual data yielded additional insights. The fact that local immunization program effort had an independent positive effect on the hazard of full immunization points up the efficacy of targeted PHC interventions. This finding is all the more remarkable in that we use municipal-level administrative data to capture a significant effect on householdlevel outcomes. Further, the absence of socioeconomic differentials in the logit models and of urban/rural differentials in the hazard models implies that neither poverty nor geographical inaccessibility were decisive determinants of immunization behaviors. In Guatemala, Goldman and Pebley (1994ft) also found pronounced invariability in these traditional immunization determinants and attributed it to the force of mass immunization campaigns.
High local coverage rates reflect intensive utilization but may also capture more subtle supply-side effects, such as the quality of services provided. In a recent study, Mensch et al. (1994) matched health-facility level data to individual records from Peru's 1992 DHS survey. Using multilevel logit

models, the authors showed that contraceptive behaviors were significantly affected by the quality of local family planning services. The latter effect, however, was modest compared to those of maternal education and other household-level indicators.
Use of prenatal services added to cardholdership likelihood and increased the hazard of full immunization among cardholders. These two health-seeking behaviors are apparently positively correlated, a finding which has been observed elsewhere (Eng, 1988; Chowdhury, 1990; WHO, 1991; Goldman and Pebley, 1994ft). The positive immunization program effects among observably "high-risk" cardholders lend support to the notion that long-term behavioral changes are largely the result of routine PHC service utilization. However, we cannot distinguish whether the correlation was due to selection or to behavioral changes which affected household health production function inputs.
In the Colombian context at least, campaigns and social mobilization efforts aimed at achieving specific goals such as polio eradication enhance rather than defeat the long-term goal of increasing routine immunization demand. To the extent that health behaviors are interdependent, such selective interventions may stimulate demand for other PHC services as well.
