To evaluate the impact of family-planning programs, it is important to know whether or not women who voluntarily accept sterilization or contraceptive methods have higher fecundability than those who do not accept them.1 If the acceptors do have higher monthly probabilities of conceiving than other women of their age class, then the program is likely to avert more future births. Measuring the fecundability differentials for older women is especially important since they make up the bulk of the acceptors in the early stages of a program.
Questions regarding the fecundability differences between users of contraception and nonusers have been raised by demographers interested in family-planning programs. Freedman and Takeshita (1969), have concluded that acceptors probably have higher fecundability than nonacceptors. Their conclusion was based on indirect evidence, such as the fact that the acceptors in their study had higher fertility than nonacceptors for as long as ten years prior to interview, suggesting high fecundability.
1 In demographic literature, fecundity is used to denote the physiological capacity of women to produce a live birth, fertility is a measure based on the actual number of live births, and fecundability refers to the monthly probability of conceiving.

In the present analysis it will be shown that the users of birth control techniques had higher fecundability at marriage than nonusers and that women with higher initial fecundability became acceptors in the family-planning program studied. This is an independent test of the conclusion reached by Freedman and Takeshita, although both analyses are based on data taken from an intensive fertility survey (for details, see Jain, 1968; Freedmen and Takeshita, 1969) conducted in Taichung City of Taiwan at the end of 1962 prior to a year-long familyplanning program (see Berelson and Freedman, 1964). These women were then reinterviewed at the end of 1963 after the completion of the program. The data are based on a probability sample of 2,443 married women aged 20-39 living with their husbands at the time of interview. From a later survey, we also know whether or not these women became acceptors by July 1, 1965. Of the 17% of women accepting contraception, about 78% accepted IUCD's and the rest chose traditional methods.
METHOD
Fecundability is denned as the monthly probability of conception in the absence of contraception, outside the gestation period

and period following the termination of a pregnancy. Average fecundability for a group of heterogeneous women can be estimated on the basis of a Type I geometric model (Jain, 1968,1969; Potter and Parker, 1964) which is based on the following four assumptions:
1. Conception is a random event. 2. Fecundability "p" of each couple remains constant from month to month until conception. 3. Fecundability among couples is distributed according to a Pearsonian Type I distribution. 4. The number of couples is adequate.

Under these assumptions, the average and

variance of fecundability for a group of

women are given by the following expres-

sions:

p = a/a+l

(1)

and

V(p) = ab/{a + bY{a + b + 1) , (2)

where a and b are two parameters in Pearson's Type I distribution, and their values are estimated from the observed frequency distribution of first pregnancy interval--the period between the onset of marriage and the beginning of first conception. For this purpose, women who were definitely premaritally pregnant (158) or had used contraception during the first pregnancy interval (29) or did not conceive even once prior to first interview (66) are excluded.
The Type I geometric model has been tested elsewhere (Jain, 1968, 1969) for the remaining 2,190 women taken together, and after controlling their age at marriage. For this purpose, the observed number of women conceiving during each successive month after marriage was compared with the corresponding theoretical values obtained on the assumption of the Type I geometric model. The statistically insignificant values of chi-square at the 5% level of significance showed that the differences between the observed and theoretical number of women

conceiving during each successive month following marriage could have arisen due to random fluctuation. On this basis it was concluded that the Type I geometric model fits all women in the sample quite well as well as subgroups, and that the values of p and V(p) can be used as reliable estimates of the average and variance of fecundability at marriage for women in this sample.
In the present analysis we have estimated the averages and variances of fecundabilities for different subgroups on the assumption that the Type I geometric model fits these subgroups as well. This assumption has not been tested empirically for the subgroups used here. For simplicity, the estimated averages and variances of fecundabilities are shown in terms of 1,000 women instead of per woman.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows the average fecundabilities with their standard errors for acceptors and nonacceptors as of July 1, 1965. Those couples sterilized by the second interview (end of 1963) are shown separately. The acceptors are subclassified by whether or not they had used contraception and/or induced abortion after the first pregnancy but prior to first interview (1962). Nonacceptors are also subclassified into two groups according to their contraceptive status prior to first interview. In all, we have divided the couples into five categories.
In Table 1, the average fecundabilities are shown in absolute terms as well as indices relative to the fecundability level for all women. It has been shown elsewhere (Jain, 1968, 1969) that the estimated average fecundability for all women is deflated as a result of memory biases in reporting the early pregnancy losses and in misreporting the dates of marriage and that it is inflated as a consequence of truncation bias resulting from the fact that the interview date curtailed the childbearing period of women included in the sample. Both these

tions of this result are: (1) Theimpact of the program is greater than would be expected on the assumption that acceptors have the same fecundability as nonacceptors; the acceptors have a greater potential for producing births than the other women with lower fecundability. (2) Even if older women with higher parity are more likely to accept the IUCD or other contraceptive methods in a family-planning program, it is worthwhile to invest resources in such a program because these women have the potential to produce substantially more births than the average women of their age class. This does not imply that these acceptors would not have adopted some method of birth control

in the absence of an organized family-planning program. I t is probable, however, that a greater proportion of them will adopt contraception and adopt it earlier in an organized program. Even small gains in proportion and timing may represent a significant number of births averted in a group with such high fecundability.
