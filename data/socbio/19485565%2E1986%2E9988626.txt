ABSTRACT: All family planning clinics and a random sample of private physicians throughout the United States were surveyed in 1972 and 1984 to discern the importance of eligibility criteria in the process of screening vasectomy applicants. In general, age and parity expectations have become significantly more flexible and liberal over a decade of waning vasectomy popularity. Physicians in the two surveys tend to ascribe greater importance than does clinical staff to marital status, religious conflicts, marital stability, and spousal consent. Both groups currently place less emphasis on eligibility criteria than they did twelve years ago.

In the early 1970's, the popularity of elective vasectomy was becoming increasingly evident. The rate of increase of both vasectomies performed and applicants refused the procedure by private physicians and family planning clinics snowed a sharp and steady upward swing. Other national data confirmed a trend of increased incidence (Uhlman, 1974; Nations Health, 1971).
In contrast to the increasing incidence of elective vasectomy, medical literature suggested a wide range of potential eligibility requirements for men seeking performance of the procedure. Little consistency was apparent among authors regarding the commonly advocated eligibility criteria of age, parity, psychological fitness, maturity, mutual agreement of applicant and spouse, degree of knowledge of the operative procedure, marital stability, religious compatibility, length of time vasectomy had been considered prior to application, psychosomatic illness, and other related factors.
Suggestions in the literature ranged from an unnecessarily restrictive and

cautious posture to omission of any specific criteria. In the absence of authoritative medical guidelines, authors' suggested criteria have generally reflected intuitive and experiential qualities. Earlier sources (Carlson, 1970; Erling, 1971; Parker, 1967) are typical of divergent approaches to criteria. More recent literature, generally physiologically focused (Husset, 1981; Lancet, 1983), seems less restrictive but still reflects a continued idiosyncratic pattern. The processes of assessing and determining eligibility and of interviewing and counseling the applicant have also been addressed in a haphazard fashion (Uhlman, 1975).
In an effort to determine more accurately the actual utilization and application of eligibility criteria by physicians and family planning clinic staff, a study was conducted which elicited the importance of specific factors in assessing the suitability of applicants for the operative procedure (Uhlman, 1973).
The present article reports replicated survey results of the above noted study conducted following a twelve year inter-

val. In addition to determining the current utilization of eligibility criteria, the replicated study provides data to compare and contrast changes over time. It is possible, therefore, to observe changes and emerging trends in the screening and selection of vasectomy applicants at primary service delivery sites: private physician offices and family planning clinics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
In both the 1972 and 1984 studies, random samples of private physicians and all clinics were surveyed throughout the United States. A mailed questionnaire was used to gather data from 114 private physicians and 72 clinics in 1972, and 97 physicians and 78 clinics in 1984.
Although both clinics and private physicians were self-selected (i.e., all had placed their names voluntarily on the Association for Voluntary Sterilization roster to be recipients of referrals), the survey populations appeared to be essentially representative of their counterparts throughout the health care system.
Since vasectomy performance is available through both clinic services and private physicians, it was possible to note only the overall configuration of eligibility criteria in the service system, but also differences between the service delivery modes. In the former, eligibility criteria and decisions potentially involve an interdisciplinary approach (i.e., the consultation between physician, nurse, social worker, counselor, etc.), while in the latter the private physician would shoulder sole responsibility. A primary objective of the study was to compare and contrast criteria within the context of the two delivery modes.
Respondents were asked a series of

questions about criteria that had been established and were followed in the decision to accept or reject a vasectomy applicant. Specific areas of interest resolved around: the youngest age range of acceptability; age and parity combinations that would be acceptable; the importance of religious conflicts, marital status, marital stability, spouse consent, and emotional stability; and the length of time that vasectomy should have been considered by the applicant prior to application.
Individual clinics and private physicians devote different amounts of time to the performance of vasectomy in their total services. This factor was controlled so that assessment was possible of its potential influence on eligibility criteria. Significant differences between physicians and clinics were viewed in terms of chi-square tabulations.
RESULTS
In order to control for the differing amounts of time devoted to vasectomy performance among service agents, it was necessary to determine the proportion both groups devoted exclusively to the operative procedure. This did not seem to vary greatly between the groups. Few clinics or physicians devoted more than 25 per cent of their time to the performance of vasectomy.
In Table 1, it can be noted that neither clinics nor physicians were heavily invested solely in vasectomy performance. This pattern is consistent between the two studies, and no statistical differences were apparent between the study populations. In general, a slightly higher number of clinics spend more time in vasectomy performance, while physicians tend to spend somewhat less time performing the procedure. One trend is

apparent for both groups. Clinics and physicians both report less time devoted to vasectomy performance in 1984 (as reflected in the 10 per cent level data) than they did twelve years ago.
Review of the literature shows that a common measure of eligibility has been the age of an applicant. In 1972 clinics were more likely than physicians to accept younger applicants, as illustrated in Table 2, but the difference was not statistically significant. However, in the present survey, significantly more clinics than physicians reported acceptance of younger men (P < .02). It is remarkable that in 1972 nearly 20 per cent of clinics expected applicants to be between 27 and 34 years old, but in 1984 this expectation had decreased to less than 5 per cent of clinic services. Increases in clinic percentages for 22-26 and 18-21 age ranges are likewise impressive. Generally, clinics have accepted younger vasectomy applicants than have physicians, and this trend has apparently accelerated over time.
Age alone is only one dimension, since family parity has often been advocated in the literature as a factor to be coupled with age for eligibility criteria. In the survey questionnaire, several alternatives were offered the respondents

coupling age and family parity in various combinations reflecting degrees of restrictiveness and flexibility. In Table 3, the selection of age-parity criteria is shown for both groups; percentages reflect the number of respondents selecting each item as a group.
In 1972 data tended to picture private physicians as significantly less flexible than clinics in their age-parity expectation for vasectomy applicants. The lower three age-parity categories dramatically illustrate this pattern. However, in 1984 fewer differences seem to exist between groups.
Indeed, for private physicians, the per cent increase from 1972 to 1984 for the younger-age and lower-parity categories has been remarkable. Similar data for clinics seem to show a converse trend, reflecting less flexibility in ageparity criteria. However, more clinic respondents (27 per cent vs. 13 per cent) noted that age-parity criteria were not specifically appropriate to or compatible with their overall eligibility criteria. Frequent unsolicited remarks indicated that eligibility decisions rested more on other criteria than age or parity and were handled on a case-by-case basis.
In general, data from both clinic and private physician groups seem to reflect

a moreflexibleand liberal application of age and parity eligibility criteria compared to the earlier study.
At the time, the 1972 data suggested that not only were private physicians more concerned about legal ramifications (self-protection and defensive medicine) and maturity of the applicant, but also higher parity tended to insure against potential untoward reactions and misgivings in the event of the death of progeny. Recent survey data seems to suggest that these concerns are less important today than in the past.
Several additional factors are frequently suggested in the literature as potential criteria of eligibility. Among these factors are: religious conflicts, marital status (whether unmarried men should be vasectomized), marital stability, spouse consent, history of emotional instability, and period of time vasectomy has been considered prior to application. Respondents were asked to designate whether these were important factors in consideration of eligibility within an "agree", "disagree," or "notimportant" context. Questions were ar-

ranged so that responses of agreement would indicate a more restrictive stance, while disagreement or unimportance would reflect a less restrictive posture. In Table 4, responses of the two groups are shown regarding attitudes toward the above criteria, excluding time of consideration prior to vasectomy application.
Private physicians selected spousal consent, marital stability, and religious conflicts to receive highest agreement responses in both the original study and the replicated 1984 survey. Clinics mirrored this pattern, except that emotional stability received relatively high importance also.
In 1972 no statistical significance existed between the data for the two groups, although spouse consent approached the 0.05 level indicating higher importance for physicians. In 1984 statistical differences between groups existed for most eligibility criteria: religious conflicts (P < 0.001), marital status ( P < 0.001), marital stability (P<0.05) and wife's consent (P < 0.001).

ity remained nearly equal for the groups, physicians tended to ascribe greater importance to all other criteria.
The apparent difference between groups should not overshadow a striking trend which can be noted by comparing the 1972 and 1984 data--a marked decrease in the intensity of "strongly agree" and "agree" responses. This trend exists for all criteria and for both groups. Confirmation of the pattern isillustrated by the increases of "not important" for both groups in all but one category.
If "strongly agree" and "agree" percentages are combined, as displayed in Table 5, a rank order of eligibility criteria is shown which reflects the relative strength of each category for both groups. Also discernible is the relative decrease of importance for each over time. It becomes apparent that the group statistical differences noted above

are the result of a much greater rate of decrease evident for clinic services.
While physicians' selections remained substantially the same from 1972 to 1984 (1 = spouse consent, 2 = tie between marital stability and religious conflicts), clinic ranking of criteria shifted significantly. In 1972 spouse

consent was the primary factor, with religious conflicts of secondary importance, and marital stability and emotional stability nearly equal in a third level of importance. However, by 1984, clinics have deemphasized significantly the factor of spouse consent in favor of the emotional stability of the vasectomy applicant. Importance of other criteria is significantly less than indicated in the 1972 study.
Whether an applicant had considered the operative procedure for a necessary or specified length of time prior to seeking surgery was not important to roughly one-third of the 1972 and 1984 respondents. It is interesting that more physicians specified a time period in 1984, and in general those noting a preferred time selected alternatives of shorter duration in both instances. The clinic pattern roughly mirrored that of physicians except that six months was the most frequently selected alternative. No statistical differences were apparent in the groups' data (See Table 6).
CONCLUSIONS
In assessing the apparent change over time from 1972to 1984, we find that survey data suggests that greater uniformity andflexibilityin eligibility criteria exists regarding vasectomy performance. This phenomenon seems to be true for both private physicians and family planning clinics, with the latter considerably more flexible in service delivery.

plicants, has occurred concurrently with a decreased demand for the operative procedure throughout the United States (AVS Factsheet). Perhaps the latter trend has significantly influenced the former, particularly with regard to requisite revenue generation in clinic settings. Nevertheless, a trend has evolved which may well accelerate in the future.
As criteria have become less restrictive over the years, no groundswell of untoward actions is evident in the literature. Medical sequelae and litigation against practitioners apparently has not escalated as eligibility criteria waned in importance.
Perhaps the need for eligibility criteria for vasectomy performance has been more imagined than real in the health care system. An earlier perceived need to practice defensive medicine apparently is giving way to more barrier-free access to and performance of elective vasectomy.
