ABSTRACT: The addition of personality measures to measures of family background and of cognitive ability substantially increased prediction of the educational attainment of middle-aged males and females. The addition of personality measures to measures of family background, cognitive ability, and own educational attainment substantially increased the prediction of the occupational attainment of middle-aged males. Despite some differences, results generally were similar across sexes and ethnic groups.

To the degree that a society permits upward mobility individual differences in cognitive abilities and personality characteristics may be expected to affect the socioeconomic status (SES) attained by individuals. Herrnstein (1973) has argued that the United States is "meritocratic," i.e., that individual differences in intellectual ability that are, in part, genetic in origin, play a significant role in determining the occupational levels that individuals attain. He has been criticized (e.g., Kamin, 1974) for having taken this position. Despite basic ideological differences with Herrnstein, Jencks and his associates (1972) acknowledge that individual differences in ability have an influence upon SES, though largely indirectly through educational attainment.
Jencks (1972) also suggested that personality characteristics, such as selfconfidence and self-control, account for much of the variance in individuals' occupational attainment that cannot be accounted for by their family background,

cognitive abilities, or education. More recently, Jencks (1979) presented evidence in support of the influence of personality variables on occupational attainment. However, personality was assessed through ratings, and the sample was quite young, so that there still was room for substantial occupational change--usually in an upward direction--for the subjects of Jencks' analysis.
The correlation of global IQ with occupational level has been found to be approximately +0.50 (Herrnstein, 1973, p. 203; Jencks et al., 1972, p. 185 and Appendix B). It would seem reasonable that individual differences in specific cognitive abilities may also influence occupational level. However, the only data regarding the relationship between specific cognitive abilities (e.g., verbal ability, spatial ability) and occupational status come from the research of Fozard and Nuttall (1971), who examined the relations of General Aptitude Test Battery scores to occupa-

tional level. Among their findings was that socioeconomic status (SES) was more strongly related to general intelligence and verbal and numerical ability than to spatial and perceptual ability and dexterity. Aside from the Jencks study noted above, there are few data available with respect to the relationship between personality characteristics and occupational status. Turner and Martinez (1977) found that for men with above-average education a Machiavellian personality facilitated occupational attainment over and above the influence of the subject's father's occupational and the subject's own education, race, and age. For men with below-average education there was an inverse relationship. Facilitative effects of Machiavellianism were found for women regardless of educational level attained.
If education is, in fact, the most important mediating variable affecting occupational attainment, then the prediction of an individual's final educational attainment is in itself an important area for study. For subjects still attending school, studies (e.g., Cattell and Butcher, 1968;Barton et al., 1972;Mandryk and Schuerger, 1974; Watterson et al., 1976) indicate that information regarding an individual's personality, as measured by standardized tests, increases the accuracy of prediction of academic achievement relative to that from intelligence test scores alone.
The primary objective of the present report is to assess the relations of scores on standardized psychometric tests of personality and cognition with the educational and occupational levels attained by a group of middle-aged male and female subjects. Along with sex differences, possible ethnic differences in the relative influence of background, ability, and personality are examined by

comparing results obtained from Americans of European ancestry (AEA) with those obtained from Americans of Japanese ancestry (AJA).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
As part of the Hawaii Family Study of Cognition (HFSC) (see DeFries et al., 1979; Wilson et al., 1975, for descriptions of the HFSC), 1,816 families consisting of two biological parents and one or more offspring over the age of 13 were tested on a battery of fifteen cognitive tests (see Wilson et al., 1975). These tests loaded on four factors: Verbal Ability, Spatial Ability, Perceptual Speed and Accuracy, and Visual Memory (see DeFries et al., 1979). The unrotated first principal component correlated 0.73 with full-scale Wechsler Adult Intelligence Test scores and may be regarded as a measure of general intelligence (Kuse, 1977). Respondents provided information regarding their own years of education and their occupation. Occupational level was quantified using Duncan's National Opinion Research Council (NORC) rating system (Reiss et al., 1961). Studies (see Harasymiw et al., 1977, for a review and new data) have confirmed the reliability, stability overtime, and meaningfulness in American society of the concept of occupational status. Our respondents also provided information regarding the years of education of their fathers and mothers and, during later years of testing, provided information regarding paternal occupation.
While the HFSC was conducted in order to assess genetic and environmental influences on cognition, various subsets of subjects were administered personality measures as well. During the summer of 1975, members of 188 fami-

lies were administered a series of supplemental measures of ability and information processing in addition to being retested on the standard HFSC cognitive test battery. Family members also were asked to complete the Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI) (Eysenck and Eysenck, 1968) and the Comrey Personality Scales (CPS) (Comrey, 1970). The EPI measures two major bipolar dimensions of personality: Introversion vs. Extraversion and Emotional Stability vs. Neuroticism. A responsebias scale (Lie) is also available. The CPS yields scores on eight bipolar personality dimensions: Trust vs. Defensiveness, Orderliness vs. Lack of Compulsion, Social Conformity vs. Rebelliousness, Activity vs. Lack of Energy, Emotional Stability vs. Neuroticism, Extraversion vs. Introversion, Empathy vs. Egocentrism, and Masculinity vs. Femininity.
Members of the same 118 families were contacted in the spring of 1976 and asked to participate in additional research. One hundred and five of the families (393 individuals) agreed to participate and, among other measures, were administered the Cattell Sixteen Personality Factor Scales (16PF) (Cattell et al., 1970). Only the sixteen primary source trait scores were developed for this sample. These include: Sizia vs. Affectia (Reserved vs. Outgoing), Low vs. High Intelligence, Low vs. High Ego Strength (Emotional-Stable), Submissiveness vs. Dominance, Desurgency vs. Surgency (Sober vs. Happy-go-lucky), Weak vs. Strong Superego Strength (Expedient vs. Conscientious), Threctia vs. Parmia (Shy vs. Venturesome), Harria vs. Premsia (Tough vs. Tenderminded), Alaxia vs. Protention (Trusting vs. Suspicious), Praxernia vs. Autia (Practical vs. Imaginative), Artlessness

vs. Shrewdness, Untroubled Adequacy vs. Guilt Proneness (Placid vs. Apprehensive), Conservatism vs. Radicalism of Temperament, Group Adherence vs. Self Sufficiency, Low vs. High Strength of Self Sentiment (Casual vs. Controlled), and Low vs. High Ergic Tension (Relaxed vs. Tense).
In addition to the EPI, CPS, and 16PF, the Adjective Check List (ACL) (Gough and Heilbrun, 1965) was administered to each family member during regular test sessions for several years. A majority of those persons (approximately 60 per cent) who took the EPI, CPS, and 16PF also were part of the sample administered the ACL. The ACL is a three-hundred adjective checklist originally scored by Gough and Heilbrun to yield twenty-four scale scores. Fifteen of the scale scores were developed on a rational or theoretical basis to measure the needs outlined by Murray (1938), five other scales were developed empirically on the basis of relevant criteria, while the remaining scales are primarily indices of testtaking behavior. Because of criticisms with regard to the lack of independence and psychometric properties of these scales (Masterson, 1974), it was decided to rescore the three-hundred items of the ACL, using the results of an item factor analysis by Parker and Veldman (1969).
Parker and Veldman's analyses yielded seven factors. Alpha reliability coefficients calculated on the 3,411 HFSC individuals who took the ACL, the number of adjectives loading on the factor, and some representative adjectives are given in parentheses after the seven factors: Social Desirability (0.90; 28 items; pleasant, kind, warm); Interpersonal Abrasiveness (0.65; 9 items; rude, lazy, foolish); Ego Organization

(It should be noted that these subjects had completed their education several decades before testing, since their mean ages, across sexes and ethnic groups, were in the mid 40's.) The obtained correlations of these variables with educational attainment are fairly consistent across both ethnicity and sex.
From Table 3 it can be seen that educational attainment is a strong predictor of occupationl attainment, and one would expect correlations of family background, cognitive ability, and personality with occupational attainment to be similar to those found for educational attainment. The correlations of the family background items with occupational attainment are similar to those found for

educational attainment and are consistent across ethnicity, in spite of the AJA's parents coming from a lower socioeconomic stratum than those of the AEA subjects (see Table 1). In accord with previous reports, the subjects' occupational status is positively correlated with cognitive ability (see Table 3) for both the first principal component (an index of "global IQ") and for some of the factor scores. Again, verbal ability shows the strongest relation to occupational attainment, as it did for educational attainment.
A most striking aspect of these cognition correlations is the difference between ethnic groups in the magnitude of the correlations. For verbal ability and the first principal component, the AJA correlation with occupational attainment is 0.15 to 0.20 higher than the

whether personality had a significant effect over and above family background and cognitive ability, and to establish the total amount of variance thus accounted for.
The subjects' paternal and maternal education and paternal occupation level and their unrotated first principal component scores were entered into hierarchical multiple regressions to establish the influence of each on educational attainment. Personality scale scores (the ACL for the large sample; Eysenck,

Comrey, and 16PF for the subsample) were then entered into the regressions in stepwise fashion, retaining only those scales that accounted for a significant (/?<0.05) increase in amount of explained variance. Each personality measure (ACL, EPI, CPS, and 16PF) was entered into a separate regression, since it seems certain that the personality scales overlap substantially in content. The same procedure was followed, with the additional hierarchical inclusion of the subjects' own educational attain-

The results of the multiple regressions on educational attainment are presented in Table 5. With the exception of the males in the subsample, for whom the variance accounted for by family

background was unusually large, cognitive ability was a strong predictor of educational attainment over and above the influence of family background. Family background had a notably stronger effect for AEA females on their educational attainment, an interesting finding when one considers that most of these subjects were not working outside the home at the time of testing.

has roughly the same influence across sexes and ethnicity, with personality factors reflecting "rebelliousness" or "nonconformity" accounting for a significant amount of variance over and above that accounted for by family background and cognitive ability. The direction of causality here is, of course, debatable.
With regard to occupational attainment (Table 6) family background is

roughly equally important for males and females and for AEA's and AJA's, but is for the most part insignificant. Cognitive ability was a strong predictor of occupational attainment for all but AEA females (AEA's comprised half of the cases in the subsample), this particular group being notably less predictable in their occupational attainment. For all groups, educational attainment re-

mained a strong predictor of occupational attainment over and above the effect of family background and cognitive ability. The independent contribution of personality, as measured by the CPS, 16PF, and ACL, even after entering family background measures, subject's own first principal component and educational attainment (the last two known

to be associated with the subject's personality), significantly increases the variance accounted for in the regressions for males. CPS Egocentrism and 16PF Shrewd seem to reflect the same Machiavellianism factor studied by Turner and Martinez (1977). For the most part, personality was not a significant factor in the occupational attainment of females.

The lack of consistently significant variance accounted for by the ACL may be due to the present scales not being sensitive to the apparently important Machiavellian dimension of personality.
DISCUSSION
The essence of prejudice is to fail to recognize individual differences within a given group. While stereotyping would be expected to lower the correlations of personal characteristics with occupational attainment, the results of this study demonstrate that in many cases the correlations are actually higher for the AJA group than for the AEA's. Sexual stereotyping does not seem to have had a profound effect on the final educational attainment of the present sample, with the possible exception of AEA females, for whom family background had a stronger determining effect. Correlations and overall predictability on this variable are otherwise qute similar across sexes.
A case for sexual discrimination may be made with regard to occupational attainment from the notably reduced predictability of AEA females (most of whom were not working outside the home at the time of testing) and the lack of significant correlations were personality for all females on this variable. Although there is only a small difference between sexes in mean NORC ratings (see Table 1), we did not collect data in this sample regarding differences in salaries between sexes, and it is possible that here some discrimination would have been evident.
So far as we are aware, the present report is the first to report for males and females, Caucasian and non-Caucasian, data regarding the association of family background, cognitive ability, and per-

sonality with educational and occupational attainment. Family background, cognitive ability, and personality appear to be associated with educational attainment to much the same degree, overall, for the four groups, with the possible exception of AEA females noted above.1 This similarity is found in spite of the AJA subjects' parents coming from a lower socioeconomic stratum than those of the AEA subjects (see Table 1). For this AJA generation, there was apparently a strong commitment to education as a means of upward mobility, regardless of the parents' own educational and occupational attainment. With the exceptions noted above, there is also a fair degree of similarity across groups in the associations of family background, cognitive ability, personality, and own education with occupational attainment. In general, family background has relatively less influence on either educational or occupational attainment than is commonly believed.
The term "meritocracy" has been used to describe a society in which occupational success results from personal attributes, rather than from family influence or other extra-individual factors. In these terms, the present data suggest that the United States has been significantly (although perhaps not strongly) meritocratic during the decades since our subjects entered the work force. On the other hand, even with all of this information available regarding each subject, less than half of the variance is accounted for. Workers themselves do not attribute their occupational choices to chance factors (Salomone and
