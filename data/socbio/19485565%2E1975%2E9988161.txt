The observed decline in the United States twinning rate over the period 1922-- 58 (Jeanneret and MacMahon, 1962) and through the early 1960's (James, 1972) has not so far been adequately explained by examination of vital statistics data. In the course of our work on the inheritance of human twinning based on data from the Genealogical Society of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (also called the Mormon Church) at Salt Lake City, Utah, we have collected data which may provide some insight into factors that may account for the decline in twinning rates among contemporary American women.
The Genealogical Society is one of the most active genealogical organizations in the world. Latter-day Saints' interest in genealogy stems from the theological belief that family relationships and family associations were intended to be eternal. Latter-day Saint families gather genealogical data concerning their ancestors for religious purposes, in order to perform "sealing" ordinances in temples erected for this purpose. Thus, although the organization of the church took place in 1830, the collection of genealogical records in-

cludes not only information on Mormons themselves but ancestors of Mormons who may have lived long before the church existed. We have extracted data from the entire collection of the Genealogical Society's records.1
The data analyzed here are based on 7,421 completed sibships, each of which contained at least one set of twins. They consist of families where the father was born in 1800 or later. In nearly 90 per cent of sibships, the father was born in the United States; among the remainder, the place of birth was Denmark, Sweden, Norway, or Holland. The families are recorded in the Genealogical Society of the Mormon Church but were not necessarily Mormons.
In a previous paper (Wyshak and White, 1965), we showed that unlike-sex twins tend to be born at later birth orders and to older mothers than do like-sex twins. In families containing only one set of twins, the number of sibs preceding likesex twins was smaller than the number preceding unlike-sex twins, the mean numbers being 3.36 and 3.51, respectively.

SOURCES: Mormon data, 1800's, are based on records of the Genealogical Society of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Salt Lake City, for completed families. Upstate New York 1960-67 data are from Selvin; 1972.

nities preceding the birth of twins and the mean number of maternities following the birth of twins by maternal age and twin type for sibships with one or more sets of twins. The mean number is 3.48 preceding like-sex twins and 3.55 preceding unlikesex twins. In age groups "under 20" and "25-29 years," the mean number of maternities preceding the birth of twins was smaller for like-sex twins than for unlikesex twins; in age groups 20-24, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, and 45 and over, the mean number preceding unlike-sex twins was smaller.
Selvin (1972), reporting on 15,023 twin pairs born to upstate New York women, 1960-67, found that mothers of like-sex twins have a lower mean number of previous pregnancies than do mothers of unlike-sex twins. This finding held for all maternal age groups (see Table 1). Differences between Selvin's data and the Mormon data are that the latter are based on genealogical records, pertain to women

temporary cross-sectional data and represent incomplete fertility.2
The observed differences with respect to mean number of maternities preceding the birth of twins may reflect differences in childbearing patterns during the two time periods. These differences are also evident in the distributions of the number of twins born classified by maternal age. In our data twins tend to be born to older mothers than they do in Selvin's. In our series about 30 per cent of the twins born were to women 35 and older; in Selvin's, about 16 per cent were to women these ages.
The proportion of the twins that were unlike-sex also differs. In the genealogical data of the nineteenth century, 36.4 per cent of the twins were unlike-sex; in contemporary data (Selvin, 1972) 31.8 per
2 The effects of completed fertility versus incomplete fertility will not bias the differences in the number of maternities preceding the birth of twins.

cent of the twins were unlike-sex. This difference may be due to the higher maternal ages at which twins were born in earlier time periods.
The comparisons made above between nineteenth-century data and contemporary data provide a hypothesis that may account for the observed decline in dizygotic twinning rates. That is, between the late 1920's and early 1960's the frequency of twins among white births in the United States declined. Jeanneret and MacMahon (1962) concluded from their analysis of trends by maternal age andby sex of twins that the decline affected dizygotic twins only. They were unable to account for this decline.
A striking difference between the childbearing patterns of nineteenth-century and twentieth-century women seems to be the earlier cessation of childbearing among the latter group of women, that is, a decrease in the fertility of women 35 and over. This decrease is reflected in a comparison of our data with Selvin's as well as more directly and over a shorter period of time in natality statistics for the United States. From Table 2 we note that up to

difference in mean numbers of maternities increases markedly by maternal age, and at ages 40 and over the difference exceeds two, the means being over 6 in our data and about 4 in Selvin's data at ages 40 and over. It is obvious then that contemporary women whohad twins at age 40or over had fewer children preceding the twins than did a comparable group of women bearing.children in the nineteenth century.
The decreasing fertility of older women over the period 1940-58 has been reported in national natality statistics (see Table 3). During this period, the fertility rates nearly doubled for women 20-24 years and showed substantial increases in women up to age 40. The per cent change in fertility rates between 1940and 1958by maternal age group showed a downward trend, from -f-90.1 per cent for age group 20-24 to --52.6 per cent for age group 45-49 (Table 4). The per cent change in twin birth rates by maternal age 1940-58 (Jeanneret and MacMahon, 1962) showed a parallel trend--f-1.2 per cent for age group 20-24 and --26.1 per cent for age group 45-49.
It appears that the decline in the over-

country can be ascribed to the reduced fertility of mothers over 30-35."
An additional consideration related to the decline in the dizygotic twinning rate may be that women who cease childbearing early are less likely to reach the optimal maternal age-birth order period for twin bearing. The frequency of DZ twinning, as is well known, is related to both maternal age and birth order. In 1964, for U.S. white women, the highest DZ twinning rate occurred in age group 35-39, previous live births 7 and over; for U.S. Negro women, the highest rate occurred in age group 30-34, previous live births 7 and over (National Center for Health Statistics, 1967).

vation. The per cent of women with 3 births at exactly age 30 increased from about 9 per cent in 1940 to 19 per cent in 1958. The result is that "younger childbearing increases the proportion of women who have all the children they want by a given age and thereby reduces the proportion of women who want additional children at later ages" (National Center for Health Statistics, 1967a, p. 7). Natality Statistics Analysis, 1965-1967 reports: "Since 1957,women who were having such high (birth) rates earlier in the 1950's . . . have been reaching the older ages of the childbearing period. Since most of them had all the children they wanted to have while they were younger, they have been
