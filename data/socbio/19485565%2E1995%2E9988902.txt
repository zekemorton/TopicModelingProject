ABSTRACT: The hypothesis of the relationship between housing types and fertility, which was
originally developed and tested in Bogota, Colombia's housing study, is reexamined using
Iranian data of urban married women of reproductive age. The findings of the study clearly and
consistently show that women living in single-family housing units have significantly higher
actual and desired fertility than women living in multi-family housing units, regardless of their
major social, economic and demographic differences. Furthermore, the analysis of the relative
effects of socioeconomic and demographic variables on fertility indicate that housing types have
greater effects on fertility than wife and husband's level of education, when the effects of other
variables are controlled.
This study implies that crowding and density, which generally are the outcome of high fertility, do have feedback effects causing fertility to decline. This provides some evidence for the hypothesis of self-generating fluctuations in population growth which maintains that a large population will face stiff economic competition, lower incomes, congestion and crowding if other means of production as well as social infrastructure do not expand simultaneously.
Finally, this study suggests an optimistic sign of fertility reduction in the large urban populations where the single-family housing units are being replaced by multi-family housing units mainly because of high cost of land, material, and labor, and the shortage of housing units. Most of the large cities in Iran today fit the above descriptions.

It is a well established fact that high fertility leads to a high population density. But the effect of high density on fertility behavior is not quite clear and requires further theoretical reasoning as well as empirical research. Some social scientists have advanced the optimistic thesis that "as population density increases, people will be motivated to have smaller families on their own initiative, before cataclysmic Malthusian suffering sets in" (Felson and Solaun, 1975). It is argued that people living in crowded housing conditions with little or no option of moving elsewhere will tend to reduce their fertility. Thus, apartment living in a tight housing market would be likely to reduce fertility.

The effect of high population density on fertility has been widely studied in animal populations. For example, Calhoun (1962) reported that high density inhibits the fertility of rats. Galle et al. (1972) reviewed a number of studies showing that the fertility of many animals is affected by high population density (see Galle et al., 1972; Pervins, 1965; Christian and Davies, 1964; and Laws and Parker, 1968).
The study of human population density and its effect on fertility has received some attention. Grauman (1965) found inverse relationships between fertility and population density for India in 1951, for the Soviet Union in 1926, for parts of Brazil and Japan in 1920-25, and for the United States

from 1800 to 1880 and from 1950 to 1960. A negative relationship between population density and human fertility was also reported in Heer's (1966) study of 41 nations and by Friedlander and Silvers in similar studies. In contrast, Galle et al. (1972) reported a positive relationship between high population density and fertility in analyzing data from 75 communities in Chicago.
On the micro level, the effect of housing types on human behaviors and attitudes has been widely studied. Wallace (1952) reported the shortcomings of raising families in high-rise apartments. Mitchell (1971) observed that high density housing in Hong Kong affected parental control over children. Crowded apartments were more likely to encourage children to spend their leisure time away from home, usually without parental supervision. Peled (1969) reported that some parents living in small apartments were unhappy that they did not have adequate space to have more children. In a crowded apartment, sexual activities, are often inhibited by the presence of others. Edwards and his associates (1992) observed that Thai couples living in crowded apartments in Bangkok were reluctant to engage in sexual activities with their spouses, because of the proximity of other people.
The relationship between housing configuration and marital fertility has been investigated in a few studies. Felson and Solaun (1975), analyzing data on public housing residents in Bogota, Colombia found "that apartment living significantly reduced fertility among lower-middle and upper-working class persons living in a tight housing market." Felson and Solaun attributed the

fertility reduction to psychosocial factors. They argued that population density itself was not responsible for the fertility reduction, but rather a feeling of crowding which they call "subjective density" which created an incentive to reduce fertility.
The Colombian study was replicated by Curry and Scriven (1978) in a longitudinal study of blacks, MexicanAmericans, and other Americans living in a housing project in Racine, Wisconsin. The Racine study found that apartment living did not reduce fertility when residential mobility was possible. However, the study observed that higher total fertility was found in couples living in dwelling units with more rooms.
Curry and Scriven (1978) integrated the concept of subjective density, formulated in the Columbian study, with the utility-cost theory to explain the fertility reduction reported in both studies. Their arguments briefly are (a) that there is a rational element in fertility behavior, (b) that people balance the satisfaction derived from having children against their costs, and (c) that a tight housing market may raise the perceived "space costs" of additional children and thus result in fertility reduction.
The relationship between fertility and housing may be evaluated in two different scenarios. (1) When the housing market is very tight and expensive, couples generally have limited choices. The housing situation acts as a proxy, limiting couples' fertility planning. For example, if a couple in a small apartment wishes to have a child but feels they need more space, they may postpone or change their fertility planning because there is little chance they can

find affordable housing. Thus, our thesis is that where couples do not have the choice to move from a small dwelling unit to a larger unit, couples tend to adjust their family size according to the space available to them. (2) When the housing market is not tight and affordable housing is available, couples can choose housing according to their needs. The household size acts as a dynamic force in the couples' residential mobility decision (see Michelson,
1977, p. 338). This paper examines the relation-
ship between types of housing and marital fertility among the urban population of Iran. Housing in Iran in the pre- and post-Islamic revolution period, particularly in large cities, has been both scarce and expensive. Therefore, we expect that housing has significantly affected the fertility pattern of Iranian couples. We hypothesize that Iranian married women living in multi-family housing units, regardless of their sociodemographic status, will have lower fertility than women living in single-family housing units. The crowded conditions of multifamily housing are likely to discourage childbearing, childraising, and adding another child to the family.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data used in this study is part of a sociodemographic sample survey of 2,126 households from three cities in a southern province in Iran--Shiraz, Jahrom, and Fasa.
Shiraz, capital of Fars province, is the largest city in the south of Iran. In 1978, when this survey took place, Shiraz had a population of 477,000, making it the fifth largest city in Iran.

In common with medium-sized Western metropolitan cities, Shiraz is an educational, cultural, medical, and administrative center for the province and a marketplace for nearby towns. Shiraz has been characterized as Iran's most modern city without industrialization.
In contrast, Jahrom was one of the most traditional cities of Fars province with 52,000 residents at the time of the survey. Fasa, in terms of modernization, fell between Shiraz and Jahrom and had 49,800 residents. The households selected from Shiraz, Jahrom, and Fasa numbered 1,286, 459, and 381, respectively.
A stratified multi-stage probability sampling procedure was used to select the households in each city. In addition to general information, 1,715 currently married women younger than age fifty were interviewed to obtain fertility data. The senior and graduate female students in sociology at Shiraz University were the field workers and conducted the interviews using a questionnaire.
In the questionnaire, respondents were asked the names and relationship of other households who lived in the same house (or apartment building). From their responses, housing has been classified in two types; (1) singlefamily housing and (2) multi-family housing. Sixty-four per cent of the households lived in single-family housing and 36 per cent lived in multifamily housing. Of the 609 households living in multi-family housing, 37 per cent were not related; 57 per cent were related by blood or marriage; and 6 per cent had a mixed relationship.
The actual and desired fertility of married women living in these two

housing types are compared while controlling for several sociodemographic variables. Our hypothesis is that actual and desired fertility of residents of these two housing types will be different and that the fertility of women in single-family housing will be higher than that of women in multi-family housing, regardless of sociodemographic attributes.
We reason that single-family housing generally has physical space for expansion to accommodate an additional person. Residents generally have more physical and social autonomy, more privacy, more space and more facilities than residents of multi-family housing. These conditions are likely to motivate single-family dwellers to have an additional child if they wish. On the contrary, the residents of multi-family housing have limited capacity for expansion, generally lacking all of the above conditions. In addition, tenants are often discouraged by the property owner from having another child. If housing choices are scarce and expensive, couples are likely to postpone or abandon plans for childbearing.
DEPENDENT VARIABLES
The actual and desired fertility of Iranian married women are treated as dependent variables. The three indicators used to measure fertility are: (1) mean number of children ever born (CEB); (2) mean number of living children (LC); and (3) mean number of desired fertility size (DFS).
INDEPENDENT VARIABLE
Type of housing is considered an independent variable. A dichotomous variable, consisting of two types of

housing configurations, is constructed to express the independent variable:
1. Single-family housing. This type of dwelling unit has only one family household whose members are socioeconomically integrated. The unit may contain a nuclear family or an extended family.
2. Multi-family housing. This type of dwelling unit has more than one family household. These households are economically independent units. They may be relatives, nonrelatives, or mixed.
In Iran, multi-family housing exists in different forms; two- or three-story houses, duplexes, and apartment buildings. Each apartment or floor typically is occupied by one household who either owns the unit or rents it. However, in relatively poor residential areas, multi-family housing often consists of a relatively large house with several tenant households. In this housing type, a tenant occupies one or two rooms and shares the house facilities (kitchen, toilet etc.) with other tenants. Housing in Iran, single house or apartment, is very expensive and generally is not affordable for young couples, particularly in large cities.
CONTROL VARIABLES
Several social, economic, and demographic variables are used as control variables:
A. Demographic Variables. 1. Wife's Current Age 2. Duration of Marriage 3. Wife's Nativity Status 4. Husband's Nativity Status 5. Breastfeeding (wife with two or more children was asked if she breastfed her child before the last). 6. Child Mortality

B. Economic Variables 1. Home Ownership 2. Household's Monthly Income 3. Household's Material Possession 4. Number of Rooms Occupied 5. Person/Room Density Index 6. Home Facilities Index
C. Social Variables 1. Wife's Educational Status 2. Husband's Educational Status 3. Wife's Family Orientation Opinion 4. Type of Family Structure 5. Husband/Wife's Urban Living Exposure 6. Current Place of Living
RESULTS
Table 1 presents the per cent distribution of the major sociodemographic attributes of Iranian married women living in the two types of housing. Sixty-four per cent of the total sample lived in single family households, and 36 per cent in multi-family households. As Table 1 suggests, the residents of the two types of housing are significantly different in regard to some attributes. Among them are home ownership, husband and wife's education, current age of wife, and her duration of marriage. For example, a large proportion (39 per cent) of the residents in multi-family housing owned their units; 77 per cent of the single-family dwellers were tenants. Over 62 per cent of wives in multi-family housing were married less than ten years versus 40 per cent of wives in single-family housing. Wives in multi-family housing were more educated and younger than wives in single-family housing. For example, 21 per cent of wives in multifamily housing were less than twenty years old versus only 6 per cent of wives living in single-family housing.

Physical space limitation was another factor differentiating the residents of the two types of housing. More than 72 per cent of the residents in multi-family housing had only one or two rooms for living versus 30 per cent of residents in single-family housing. Of the latter, 70 per cent had three or more rooms in their housing units. Finally, as Table 1 shows, 80 per cent of women living in multi-family housing were residents of Shiraz; only 20 per cent were from the sample of Jahrom and Fasa. The respective figures for single-family housing was 48 per cent of the Shiraz sample and 52 per cent of the Jahrom and Fasa sample.
Table 2 presents the distribution of the measures of marital fertility for Iranian married women living in the two types of housing by sociodemographic variables. The three indicators used to measure actual and desired fertility are mean children ever born, mean living children, and mean desired fertility size. Table 2 shows the distribution of these means for the two types of housing as well as the contexts of 18 control variables.
The means for the total sample show that women in single-family housing had a mean of 4.6 children ever born, a mean of 4.0 living children, and a mean of 4.3 children as their desired fertility. The corresponding figures for women in multi-family housing were remarkably smaller, 3.0, 2.7, and 3.5, respectively. The same pattern, almost without exception, exists among all 366 means.
In other words, Iranian women living in single-family housing consistently had higher fertility than women living in multi-family housing, regardless of their sociodemographic differ-

ences. To test this proposition, the 183 means of Type I housing were compared with the 183 means of Type II housing, and T scores were computed. The results are also reported in Table 2.
The fertility means of women in single-family housing are significantly different from the fertility means of women in multi-family housing for the total sample as well as in 86 per cent of the subgroups. From 183 comparative cases, considering all socio-

demographic factors, the T scores of only 25 comparative cases were not statistically significant. However, even these cases generally follow the overall pattern of the relationship.
As Table 2 suggests, women in single-family housing have significantly higher desires and motivations for having children than their counterparts in multi-family housing. The physical space limitation and crowded conditions which are the characteristics of the multi-family housing seem to have

stimulated the women in this type of housing to have lower demands for children compared to women living in single-family housing. Table 1 (the number of rooms occupied by women in the two types of housing) provides evidence to support this argument.
We have not yet examined the effect of type of housing on fertility while controlling the effects of sociodemographic variables. The standardized re-

gression coefficients were calculated to measure the relative effects of the type of housing variable on the fertility indicators when the effects of other sociodemographic variables are controlled. The results are shown in Table 3.
As shown in Table 3, the eleven variables as a whole are significantly related to fertility variables, as expressed in R2 and F values. Although

the eleven variables explain a large proportion of the variation of the actual fertility pattern, they explain only 10 per cent of the desired fertility size.
Table 3 also shows the relative effects of the eleven variables on fertility. Home facilities and urban exposure individually do not affect actual fertility, but the other nine variables individually have significant effects on actual fertility. In the case of desired fertility, only seven variables have significant effects. Type of housing has significant effects on actual and desired fertility. An evaluation of the relative

effects of the Beta coefficients in Table 3 indicates that type of housing has more effect on fertility than the wife's and husband's education. However, among the eleven variables, child mortality, the person-per-room index, and wife's duration of marriage are the first, second, and third influential variables affecting the number of children ever born.
CONCLUSIONS
The findings in Tables 2 and 3 consistently support the hypothesis.

(1) There is clear and significant differential fertility between residents of two types of housing among the urban population of Iran. (2) The residents of Type I (single-family) housing have significantly higher fertility than the residents of Type II (multi-family) housing, and this pattern persists when eighteen key sociodemographic variables are controlled. (3) Type of housing, regardless of other variables, affects the decision to have another child, or to postpone pregnancy, or to control fertility. Of course, in relation to housing and fertility decisionmaking, several issues must be taken into consideration. Some of them are the social, economic, and psychological cost of another child, space limitation, and housing market situations.
Our findings imply that the crowding and density, which generally are the outcomes of high fertility, do have feedback effects causing fertility to decline. Our data provide some evidence, at the micro level, for the hypothesis of self-generating fluctuations in population growth which has been introduced by a number of population economists. According to this hypothesis, a large population will face stiff economic competition, lower incomes, congestion, and crowding if other means of production as well as the social infrastructure do not expand along with population (see Easterlin, 1973; Becker, 1981; and also Barro and Becker, 1984). It is predicted that under such circumstances, fertility will decline because parents try to maintain an adequate standard of living for themselves.
Fertility studies have not paid as much attention to the effects of housing types and configuration on differ-

ential fertility as they have to other variables such as education, occupation, income, etc. Our analysis of the relative effects of sociodemographic variables on fertility indicate that housing types, regardless of the effects of other variables, have greater effects on fertility change than the effect of husband and wife's education.
In sum, our findings from three Iranian cities show that type of housing has a significant effect on the fertility decision-making of couples regardless of their socio-demographic differences. Couples residing in multi-family housing, such as an apartment, a duplex, etc., have significantly lower fertility than couples living in singlefamily housing. We have argued that scarce and expensive housing (rent and buying) in Iran, particularly in the large cities, has limited couples' choices. Consequently, they have adjusted their fertility (actual and desired) to their dwelling environments. If our findings from the Fars province are generalizable to Iran today, we anticipate further fertility reduction among urban populations due to housing. Scarce and expensive housing is a significant urban problem in Iran today. In response to the housing shortage, a large proportion of the singlefamily houses are being demolished and replaced by expensive apartment complexes. We anticipate that this development will cause further fertility reduction in the urban population of Iran. For a more conclusive explanation of the relationship between housing and fertility, more cross-sectional as well as longitudinal data on the urban population in Iran today are needed.
