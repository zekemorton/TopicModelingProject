Barbados, a small Caribbean island (166 square miles) with a population of about a quarter of a million and a density of over 1,500 per square mile, has undergone in recent times significant social and economic development. This development is reflected in its family-planning program, its low death rate, and its moderate and declining birth rate. Even though Barbados is still among the less developed nations of the world, its high literacy rate (98%) and its good transport and communication systems point to significant advances on the road to social and economic development.
With a good health service operating hospitals and clinics, the low death rate is not surprising. With a family-planning program operating through health clinics for the past fourteen years, the declining birth rate is not totally unexpected. This birth rate has been declining from 33 per thousand in 1960 down to about 22 in 1968. How did this decline come about? Unfortunately, all the data needed for answering this question are not available. However, this paper presents some indicators of what is happening to the patients who attend health clinics and therefore come in contact with the familyplanning workers. Attention will be given

to the reasons stated for not using a contraceptive method and to accidental pregnancies, miscarriages, birth intervals, the spacing and stopping of pregnancies, and other areas which may be indicative of the nature of the success of family planning.
THE DATA
The data of this study were obtained in 1967 on a sample of women selected from the patients of the Population Council Research Project (PCRP). The PCRP was established in 1965 as an affiliate of the Barbados Family Planning Association (BFPA) and operated until December 1967. The PCRP offered free Papanicolaou smears and Lippes loops (an intrauterine device), while the BFPA ran a "cafeteria style" family-planning program offering all forms of contraceptive devices. All IUCD acceptors were members of both the BFPA and the PCRP. All women who were contraceptors and had obtained a smear test were members of both organizations. Women who had a smear test but were not contraceptors were members of the PCRP only. Women who were contraceptors but did not have a smear test were members of the BFPA only.

A sample of 600 patients of the PCRP was chosen which yielded the 461 interviews that are the source of data for this paper. (The PCRP's primary goal was an examination of the relationship between IUCD's and cervical carcinoma.) The sample was chosen, using an electronic computer, in such a way as to yield almost equal numbers of present IUCD users and current nonusers of the IUCD. At the time of the drawing of the sample, the admission and followup records of these patients were stored on punched-cards and electronic tapes. A systematic sample of present IUCD users was chosen and a nonuser next in identification number to the user was also chosen as a control. In this way a systematic sample was obtained stratified by IUCD status, clinic, and time of admission into the program. The patients of the sample were interviewed either at the clinic or at home by well-trained and experienced interviewers. Many attempts were made to interview all the sample units, and the outcome is shown in Table 1.
A goal of five hundred completed interviews was set, but for a number of reasons only 461 were obtained. Comparisons with the parent population showed that this sample of 461 is representative on certain key demographic variables and therefore the missing units have not biased the sample. This sample, the same one used in this study, had as one of its goals a reliabilityvalidity check on the data obtained on the population of about fifteen thousand patients. Consequently, great care was taken

to ensure that data of a high quality were obtained. There is every reason to believe that the extra effort accomplished this task. While the data were not collected to focus directly on family planning, they allow us to examine certain family-planning behavior of these women.
FINDINGS
Before we examine the indicators of family-planning effectiveness, a few preliminary observations are in order. This sample is representative of the PCRP population which is a subsample of the PFPA clients and to a certain extent typical of Barbadian women of lower socioeconomic status. Twelve per cent of this sample had never used a contraceptive method and consequently never had been admitted to the BFPA. Also, 2.6% of these 461 women had never been pregnant, and 7.8% had no partner or husband at the time. The average number of contraceptive methods used by these women is 2 when the 56 nonusers are excluded, and 1.8 when they are not. There is a considerable amount of changing of methods, and the reasons for not using a method may point to contraceptive effectiveness or lack of it.
REASONS FOR NOT USING METHODS
In Table 2 are presented the reasons given for changing from one method to another. The category "No reason" accounts for only a very small percentage. Among the patients of the sample, there is strong indication that as the order of the method is increased, the percentage of women that continue using it is also increased. This may be reflecting two things. First, the higherorder method has been in use for a shorter period and therefore a lower drop-out rate is expected. Second, the higher the order, the larger the percentage of users of the newer more reliable methods, which so far have showed signs of retaining a larger percentage of users than the traditional

methods. If a woman goes on to more than one method, she is less likely to drop out, at least in a short time. It should be pointed out that 74.3% of the women in the sample who have used a contraceptive method report the IUCD as the method or one of the methods they have used.1 It is known that the IUCD's were all inserted since June, 1965 (a relatively short period), and that up to the time of the interview, 62.9% of these IUCD's were still in place.
The number of women reporting a method failure is relatively high, but in the expected direction when the pattern of irregular usage and the level of reliability of the methods used are taken into account. Even a very reliable method like the pill becomes very unreliable when not used regularly and as directed.
Dislike for a method accounts for some method changing. A small number of women who were using contraception to space their pregnancies gave up a method in order to have another baby. A sizable proportion of women changed from one method to another because they wanted to try a new method. These are women who are like-
1 This high proportion of IUCD users should not be surprising if it is remembered that the PCRP was an IUCD study and even though IUCD acceptors were not over-sampled, they were easier to locate and interview and consequently comprise a large proportion of the sample.

ly to increase the reliability of the method used with this change. They are continuing family planning, but they are searching for a more satisfactory method. Medical complications are the most frequently cited reason for discontinuing use of an IUCD. It is also the main reason given for not using an oral pill. The increase in the percentage, across methods, giving medical complications as a reason for discontinuing use reflects the prevalence of the IUCD and pill as methods of higher order of use. Contrary to popular beliefs, women do not see their partners as influential in their decisions to use or not to use a method. All in all, the reasons given for not using a method are good indicators of the diffusion process as well as the effectiveness of the program as mirrored by method usage.
ACCIDENTAL PREGNANCY
In addition to asking women for their reasons in discontinuing a method, the interviewer also asked if they had in fact had an unplanned or unwanted pregnancy while using the methods they claimed to have used. The percentage distribution of those who experienced accidental pregnancies while using a contraceptive are given in Table 3. The percentages of women on the different methods admitting accidental preg-

nancies are very high. The vaginal users show thehighest rate, as would be expected, but the number of accidental pregnancies is certainly unexpected. The pattern of usage of contraception among the clients of the family-planning program shows a very high failure rate, supposedly of the method. Failure in this situation is due much more to the way the method is used than to the method itself. Even the most unreliable of the methods in the program can be very successfully used if the client is highly motivated and uses it as directed.
The oral contraceptive pill users also experienced a high failure rate among these women. This, too,is not wholly unexpected. The pill, if not used properly and regularly, may in fact increase the fecundability of the woman. A program could be increasing the risk of pregnancy of its clients by issuing the oral pills without some assurance that they are being used as directed. One should remember that they are the same fertility pills given to subfecund women with the directions to take them for a specified period and then stop. This procedure increases a woman's chances of conception. As can be seen, the IUCD has the lowest failure rate. Once it is in place, no motivation is needed to insure its proper use. If the IUCD is not in place, a pregnancy cannot be attributed to it as a failure.
On admitting an accidental pregnancy, the women in the sample were further

asked for their opinion as to what was responsible. The answers are recorded in Table 4. Method 4 is not included, since there are too few women admitting an accidental pregnancy while using a fourth method. An increasing percentage of the women by method order believed that their pregnancy was due to some aspect of the method itself and not any fault of their own.Not taking a pill every day or a partially expelled IUCD, both resulting in pregnancies, may be attributed to defects in the methods by these women. The latter is tenable, but the former is not.It is hardly likely that most of the accidental pregnancies are due to defects in the methods themselves. What is much more probable is that the methods were not used properly, and in a majority of cases the pregnancies are due to defects in application.
It is encouraging to see that "out of

supplies" is given as a reason less frequently as the order of the method used is increased. Those who go on to one or more methods after the first are less likely to become pregnant because they ran out of supplies. Over a quarter of the women who claimed to have had an accidental pregnancy attributed it to the fact that they were not using the method at the time. They simply took a chance and became pregnant. This percentage does not differ very much by the order the method was used. Some women also admitted using the method at the time pregnancy occurred, but not using it as they were told. What is evident in the analysis is a need for diffusion of the significance of using the methods correctly as well as information on their proper use.
MISCARRIAGES
A miscarriage was defined within the PCRP as any pregnancy which is terminated within twenty weeks after conception. Therefore, miscarriages include both voluntary and involuntary abortions. It is safe to assume that a substantial number of the recorded miscarriages are induced abortions. It is believed that the abortion rate on the island is high. This is indicated by informal reports of the number of beds occupied in the hospitals by cases of complications resulting from attempted and improperly performed abortions. Induced abortion is illegal, and therefore it would be very difficult to get reliable information on it. However, it is believed that by obtaining information on miscarriages information on abortions is indirectly gained.
From the data of the PCRP sample, it is seen that the number of pregnancies among the clients is positively related with the number of miscarriages (Gamma = 0.45).2 The mean number of miscarriages per woman in the sample is 0.44 with 0.84 standard deviation. The interest in miscarriages in this section stems from an interest in abortions as an indicator of a high

level of motivation towards family limitation. It has been recorded in some studies that following closely upon the launching of a family-planning program, the number of induced abortions has a tendency to increase, but it eventually levels off at a lower rate than that existing before the introduction of the program (Glass, 1965; Tietze, 1965; Klinger, 1966; Maramatsu, 1966). The increase is due mainly to the fact that in motivating a population toward birth control by spreading the idea of preventing the unwanted pregnancy, one is inadvertently motivating the population to get rid of accidental pregnancies. When women begin to use a contraceptive method, many become pregnant due to improper use of the contraceptive in this early stage of the innovation. However, the women had made up their minds that they did not want another pregnancy at this time and therefore resort to abortions. In Barbados, the admitted failure is high, and it is suspected that the abortion rate is high too. Therefore, many of the accidental pregnancies probably end up as miscarriages in the early stages of pregnancy, an indication of the program's indirect effect upon family limitation on the island.
In Table 5 the birth intervals of six months or less between two consecutive pregnancies are presented with the time in the woman's reproductive history when she began using a contraceptive method. Methods 3 and 4 were not included in Table 5 because of the small numbers of women involved. The boldface percentages in Table 5 show quite clearly that where either Method 1 or Method 2 was accepted after the nth pregnancy, there occurred a large percentage increase in the number of

pregnancies of the (« -f- 1) order in which the interval between n and (n + 1) was less than six months. This is the range in which any terminated pregnancy would have to be a miscarriage. An interval of less than six months between two consecutive pregnancies is virtually a sure indication that the most recent is a miscarriage. It must be the case that this later pregnancy was terminated four months or less after the conception since the minimum period of post-partum amenorrhea after the earlier of the two pregnancies must be taken into account. This increase in miscarriages occurring following acceptance of a contraceptive method is a strong indication of an increase in the number of abortions. This leads to the conclusion that when there is an accidental pregnancy following adoption of family planning, there is a high probability that there will be a resort to induced abortion. In this way, a program in family planning is indirectly correcting its own errors.
BIRTH INTERVALS
The length of the birth interval also is an indication of the effectiveness of family planning, especially in the case where family planning is being used as a device for spacing children. However, it is quite

another matter when family planning is used to stop pregnancy altogether after the number of children desired has been attained or exceeded.
No significant differences are observed in the birth intervals of women in this study when intervals before and after adoption of contraceptives are compared. What differences are observed are accounted for by age, number of pregnancies, and the number of months babies are breast fed. Should it be concluded then that family planning in Barbados is used exclusively to stop conception rather than in combination with spacing? When the women in this sample were asked for what purpose they began using contraceptives, 156 of the 461, or 33.8%, replied that they wished to space their pregnancies, while 54.1% said they wanted no additional pregnancies. The remaining 12.1% were women who have never used a contraceptive method. In view of this finding, some differences between the birth intervals before and after adoption of family planning might be expected, but none were found. Cross-tabulations were used to control for the time at adoption of the method, reason for beginning use, the number of methods used, and the times at which the methods were used.

Using stepwise regression analysis, we made an attempt to see what variables account for variation in the average birth interval. Because of the way the data were coded only women with six or less pregnancies were included in this analysis. If a woman had more than six pregnancies the first four were coded and then the "second to last" and "the last" which meant that for women of seven or more pregnancies, calculating the average birth interval is problematic except for the first four and the two last ones. The open-ended birth interval since the last pregnancy was excluded from the calculation. The variables selected as independent variables were selected on the two criteria that they had to be interval scales and that they were likely to influence the birth interval. The variables thrown into the analysis appear in the following paragraph.
The variance with respect to the average birth interval is 7 1 % accounted for by the present age of the woman (Xi)3, her age at first pregnancy (X2), the number of months the second child was breast fed (X3), the number of months the third child was breast fed (Xi), and the age of the mother at the last pregnancy (X6). Individually, these variables, (Xi-X6), account for 49%, 14%, 4%, 3%, and 1% of the variance respectively. The prediction equation relating the average birth interval (F) and the five above-mentioned independent variables (Xi-Xs) is Y = - 5 . 6 + 0.87Xi - 0.37X2 + 0.54X3 + O.IOX5. It is interesting to note that both the number of months the second child was breast fed and the number of months the third child was breast fed are included in the equation, but not the number of months the first child was breast fed. The reason for this is not obvious. It
3 This is in keeping with findings in other studies such as Potter et al. (1965), Sheps and Menken (1969), and Sheps and Perrin (1964) and the factors they found accounting for this fact such as increasing pregnancy wastage, lengthening of menstruating intervals, and longer post-partum amenorrhea.

could be that there is very little variation in the number of months the first child was breast fed. The number of pregnancies is correlated highly with the average birth interval (r = 0.69). The number of pregnancies correlated with the number of months breast-fed for each child from the first to the last, with r = 0.17, 0.37, 0.45, 0.52 up to the fourth and r = 0.58 and 0.59 for the second to the last and the last child.
There is no doubt that pregnancies occur among the users of the facilities of the family-planning program and that eventually as the influence of the program becomes more pronounced that differences will occur between the birth intervals before and after acceptance of contraception. However, with the small sample used in this study and the haphazard use of contraception among clients, it is not surprising that we failed to detect the influence of contraception on the birth intervals for either the spacers or the unsuccessful stoppers.
SPACING AND STOPPING
When a woman decides to practice contraception, we can assume that she has come to a decision on the basis of either not wanting another pregnancy or not wanting it at that time. The former group of women will be referred to as "stoppers" and the latter as "spacers." The patients of the PCRP sample were classified under these two headings, and then within each of these two groups the relationship between parity at the time of acceptance and parity at the time the patient was interviewed was investigated. In this way it is possible to find out if there is a difference in terms of change in parity after acceptance between the two groups of women. Ideally, those women who claimed they began contraception for the purpose of stopping further conception should increase their parity much less than those who did so for spacing their pregnancies. Some stoppers may be expected to in-

144

Ebanks

crease their parity through accidental pregnancies and some by changing their minds about further pregnancies; but overall there should be less parity change than among the spacers. These two groups (spacers arid stoppers) are divided further into groups according to the number of methods they have used.
There is a strong positive relationship between parity at first use of contraception and parity at the time of interview for spacers who have used one method. The strength of this relationship as measured by Gamma is 0.86 (see Table 6). If there was no change of parity, a Gamma of 1.00 would have resulted. For spacers who have used two methods, the strength of the relationship between the same two variables is 0.74; for three-method users it is 0.65; and for four-method spacers it is down to 0.24. For the stoppers, these same coefficients of association are 0.93,0.79,0.80, and 0.68, respectively. The same interpretation applies in both cases. It would appear that stoppers have increased their parities far less than spacers. This is in the expected direction and strongly points to a measure of success among this group of women in planning their families.
A question that may be asked, however, is what accounts for the varying degrees of strength of association for spacers as the number of methods used is increased? This
TABLE 6
COEFFICIENTS OF ASSOCIATION (GAMMA) BETWEEN PARITY AT THE TIME CONTRACEPTION WAS USED AND PARITY AT THE TIME OF INTERVIEW FOR SPACERS AND STOPPERS BY NUMBER OF METHODS USED

phenomenon is also present among the stoppers. Here the crucial variable would appear to be time. The number of methods used reflects the length of time in the program, and therefore the more time there is for the parity at the time of interview to diverge from parity at the time at which contraception was first used. In general, it may be asserted that there is some difference between spacers and stoppers in terms of the increase in parities after the start of contraception. For each group, the strength of the relationship between parity at the start of contraception and current parity decreases with the number of methods used. This decrease is a reflection of the cumulative effect of time as measured by the number of methods used by the women. The more methods used, the longer the length of time contraception is in use and therefore the higher the probability of increasing the parity. As an indication of effectiveness, this analysis points in the direction of some success.
When the purpose for which contraception was begun is not taken into account and the parity at the time of acceptance of the first method is compared with the number of pregnancies at the time of interview, a Gamma of 0.77 is observed. The parity at the time of acceptance of Method 1 and the parity at the time Method 1 was discontinued yield a Gamma of 0.58. The first coefficient reflects a relatively small change in parity over the period of use of contraception, while the second indicates a change in parity without an accompanying change in the method used. This may point to a situation in which women who are spacing pregnancies change their parity without altering methods.

68 women who used a new method in the twelve months prior to the interview. Of these women, 17.6% did not use any method before, 29.4% had been using a vaginal method and 1.5%, 2.9%, 5.9%, and 42.7% had been using the diaphragm, the condom, the pill, and the IUCD, respectively (see Table 7). There is a lambda (V-H) of 0.55 between what was being used before the change that took place in the twelve months prior to the interview and the method that was accepted for use. It is interesting to note that of those who changed a method in the last year prior to the interview, almost equal numbers accepted the vaginals, the pills, and the IUCD. It is seen that vaginals gained as many as they lost, while the pill gained many more than it lost, and the IUCD lost more than it gained in the changing of methods during the twelve months prior to the collection of the data. Of the 66 women in Table 7, only twelve were new to the program; the others were shifting around from one method to another. A vast majority of the sample (85%) had not accepted a new contraceptive in the last year. The reasons given for changing methods are similar to those mentioned previously. However, it should be noted that 8.3% of the women changed their method because they had become pregnant while using the particular method.

The women in the sample were asked to name the method of contraception they liked best and the results are presented in Table 8. A "majority of women claimed to like the IUCD the best and were using it. This is as expected. It might be noted that the interviewers were associated with the PCRP, which actively promoted the IUCD. It seems likely that the IUCD is preferred because it was the method currently in use. Only 36.4% of those who claimed they liked the vaginals were using one of them; in the case of the diaphragm, the percentage is even lower. In contrast, 59.6% and 76.8% of those who liked the pill and the IUCD, respectively, were using them. There is considerable opportunity for getting patients to change, particularly to methods they prefer. Why they are not using the preferred method is not clear. There is only a moderate positive relationship between

the method liked best and the method now in use (Gamma = 0.64). By getting women to use the method liked best, the program may succeed in decreasing the irregularity of use and therefore improve its effectiveness.
THE IUCD
At this point, a closer examination of IUCD use is in order. As shown previously, the IUCD acceptors constitute an overwhelming majority of the women in the sample. Over 65% of the sample had an IUCD inserted. At the time of the interview, 62.9% of these IUCD's were still in place, 22.2% had been removed and 14.9% had been expelled. The drop-out rate can be considered normal for this method in the time period involved. In fact, it may be even lower than rates evidenced in other IUCD programs (Mauldin, Nortman, and Stephan, 1967). The retention rates for IUCD programs range from 62.9% to 80.7% with re-insertions; and from 44.3% to 69.1% without re-insertions after eighteen months; and from 43% to 65% without reinsertions after 24 months (Mauldin et al., 1967). The Barbados program was in existence for over twenty-four months at the time of this study.
The reasons for removal of IUCD's were investigated. Some kind of medical complication was given as the reason for removal in 82.4% of the cases. In the removal of IUCD's the partners of the women played

a part. These women reported that 8.8% of the IUCD removals took place because their husbands or partners insisted on its removal. These men may not be opposed to contraception; rather, it is believed that their objection is to the IUCD. The knowledge that an IUCD is in situ may lead to a complaint of uncomfortableness during intercourse on the part of the partner. Another 8.8% of the women who had IUCD removals reported that this was done because of pregnancy while using the method. This percentage is almost equivalent to the 8.3% of the women who reported that they had changed their method in the twelve months prior to the interview because they became pregnant.
The distribution of IUCD acceptors by parity is given in Table 9. There is no evidence that the IUCD appealed primarily to high-parity women. Indeed, wide appeal is common among women at all parities. Zero-parity women are an exception, but this may be explained by the fact that an IUCD was offered by the PCRP only to women with at least one pregnancy. However, private physicians may have experimented with a few zero-parity women. Women with only one pregnancy are underrepresented among the IUCD acceptors, but from that parity upward there is little difference in the relative distribution of IUCD acceptors by parity. I t is clear that there is still much more room to promote it further as a contraceptive method. The
