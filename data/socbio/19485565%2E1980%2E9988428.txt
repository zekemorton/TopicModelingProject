ABSTRACT: This paper describes variation in urban Black fertility near the turn of the century. Differentials in both average numbers of children ever born and per cent childless are considered. The data source is a 1in 750 sample of households from the 1900 census manuscripts. Higher status Blacks are found to have lower fertility and a greater incidence of childnessness than are lower status Blacks. In addition, women experiencing marital disruption have considerably lower fertility than women in stable unions. The results support previous inferences of deliberate fertility control by Black women before 1900 and demonstrate the importance of marital instability as a source of fertility variation in the nineteenth century.

Documentation of dramatic fertility transitions in nineteenth-century America is fairly extensive. We know that sectors of the white population (e.g., New England native whites ) experienced declines eariy in the 1800's and that most remaining whites followed suit later in the century (Coale and Zelnik, 1963; Grabill et al., 1958; Thompson and Whelpton, 1933). It has also been shown that Black Americans underwent a dramatic transition to low fertility levels between 1880 and 1940 (Coale and Rives, 1973). While the forces underlying historical fertility trends of both Black and white Americans are somewhat problematic, explanation of the Black transition has posed especially serious difficulties.
Up to now, most empirical research into the Black fertility transition has emphasized occurrences in the twentieth century (e.g., Engerman, 1977; Farley, 1970a; Okun, 1958). However, such discussions overlook a crucial period in the downward trend of Black fertility rates. According to Coale and Rives (1973, p. 26) roughly 40 per cent of the decline in Black total fertility rates between 1850

and 1940 occurred before 1900. This sharp fertility reduction by Blacks at a time when they were largely a rural, agricultural, and illiterate population seems incongruous with the framework proposed by transition theory which stresses the influence of modernization, urbanization, and lowered mortality (Notestein, 1945; Thompson, 1929). Recent research, however, has indicated that the genesis of the Black American fertility transition was probably in urban areas. For example, estimated trends in total fertility rates between 1886 and 1899 have shown an earlier and steeper decline among urbanites. Indeed, rural residents apparently did not begin to reduce their fertility until the 1890's (Tolnay, 1981). To understand the origins of the Black fertility transition, then, it is reasonable to address the issue of urban fertility variation and its causes.

separate themes: first, general socioeconomic differentials in number of children ever born and childnessness; second, the influence of marital disruption on urban childbearing. While some description of urban Black fertility near the turn of the century already exists (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1943, 1945, 1947; Farley, 1970a, 1970Z?), the availability of a new data set allows closer examination of conditions related to Black fertility near the inception of the decline. Individual-level information from a 1 in 750 sample of households from the 1900 census manuscripts permits multivariate analyses not generally available in census tabulations (see Graham, 1980, for a complete description of the 1900 sample and the sampling procedure). Furthermore, access to the original manuscripts provides greater flexibility in the classification of marital status. Specifically, married women with spouses absent were never considered separately in 1900 census publications.
The 1900 census is the earliest existing census with data on number of children ever born (most 1890 manuscripts were destroyed by fire). In addition to fertility data, several other useful pieces of information were recorded, such as ability to read and write, occupation, marital status and duration. Although different selection criteria are employed at various stages in the following analysis, all women considered here were ever-married Blacks, fifteen years and older, living in places with more than 2,500 inhabitants.
An apparent lack of association between Black fertility trends and corresponding trends in mortality or social and economic improvement has led to an emphasis on biological causes of reduced Black fertility which are rarely mentioned in relation to white fertility trends. Originally, it was maintained that the spread of venereal diseases reduced the fecundity of

Blacks and thereby lowered their fertility (Grabill et al., 1958; Kiser et al., 1968; Thompson and Whelpton, 1933). Eventually the list of factors which might have impaired the fecundity of Blacks was expanded to include pellagra (Farley, 1970a), post-partum septicemia, rickets (Cutright and Shorter, 1979), and genital tuberculosis (Pleck, 1979). These physiological explanations for declining Black fertility have also been used to account for the sizable proportions of childless women in the early twentieth century.
Although disagreement with "impaired fecundity" explanations of Black fertility variation has existed for some time (Engerman, 1977; McFalls, 1973), only relatively recent research has provided hard evidence that deliberate efforts at family limitation may have contributed significantly to the Black fertility decline in the nineteenth century.
George Masnick and Joseph McFalls (1976, 1978) have persistently claimed that birth control by Black women was an important ingredient in the transition to low fertility levels. Recently they proposed an "alternative view" of the practice of birth control by Black women from 1860 to 1970 (McFalls and Masnick, 1981). Especially noteworthy is their estimate that between 1880 and 1900 (near the inception of the fertility decline) the practice of birth control increased from approximately 15 to 30 per cent of Black couples. While their data support their arguments about contraceptive practice in the fourth and fifth decades of the twentieth century, little could be concluded about nineteenth-century patterns of birth control, their oldest cohort having been born between 1916 and 1920. However, very recent estimates of age-specific marital fertility rates for Blacks between 1886 and 1899 partially confirm inferences drawn by Masnick and McFalls of deliber-

ate fertility limitation in the late nineteenth century. Tolnay (1981) described urban and rural patterns of Black marital fertility for two time periods (1886-92 and 1893-99). Though rural residents closely approximated a "natural fertility" population, urbanites during both time intervals exhibited age-specific schedules of marital fertility which suggested considerable fertility control.
Current wisdom attributes the decline in Black fertility to three major causes: birth control, mate separation, and impaired fecundity (Masnick and McFalls, 1976; McFalls and Masnick, 1981). Furthermore, Tolnay's (1981) findings suggest that before 1900 the relative importance of these factors varied by place of residence. Apparently, conscious birth control was largely restricted to urban areas, but within cities it was considerable. Therefore, to gain a better understanding of the origins of voluntarily reduced fertility among nineteenth-century Blacks, we now turn to the reproductive patterns of urbanites.
RESULTS
SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AND URBAN
FERTILITY LEVELS
Although most urban Blacks at the turn of the century were engaged in menial and unskilled occupations, some status differentiation did exist. A small group of professionals, skilled workers, and artisans contributed to the growing (though still minuscule) middle class, which became known as the "talented tenth" of the Black population. The little available evidence suggests that these higher status individuals contributed disproportionately to the very low fertility levels of Black urbanites in the late 1800's. Special tabulations of 1910 children-ever-born data

(U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1947) imply a sizable fertility differential by husband's occupation in cities. The appropriate information is not broken down by urbanrural residence, but a general idea of intraurban fertility variation may be obtained by examining occupational gradients in the North and West, since 70 per cent of all non-Southern Blacks were urbanites. For example, among currently married women 45 to 74 years of age in 1910, those with professional or semiprofessional husbands had borne 3.00 children; wives of clerical, sales, or kindred workers reported 4.20 children ever born; and average completed family size for wives of laborers (except farm and mine) was 5.07 children. Consideration of another indicator of social status, literacy, reveals similarly strong variation (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1945). For ever-married women 45to 74 living in the North or urban South, the ability to read and write was associated with a difference in completed fertility of 1.20 children (literates = 4.61; illiterates = 5.81).
While the data provided by these special tabulations suggest the importance of social and economic factors as determinants of urban Black fertility levels in the late 1800's, they do not allow the simultaneous consideration of several variables to control for spurious associations and to estimate the net effect of particular sources of fertility variation. In this section, the 1900 Public Use Sample of urban Blacks is used to conduct a Multiple Classification Analysis (MCA) (Andrews et al., 1973) of the fertility of married, spouse-present, Black women 15 to 44 years of age. Three indicators of family social status are considered: wife's literacy, husband's literacy, and husband's occupation. The small sample size and paucity of Black men in higher status occupations forced us to settle for a simple occupational dichotomy--

unskilled labor versus all others.1 During
the analysis, controls are employed for re-
gion of residence, labor force status of the
wife, and the couple's marital duration.
The results from the MCA are pre-
sented in Table 1. Column 1shows the un-
adjusted means of children ever born; and
Column 2 reports corresponding means
after they have been adjusted for the ef-
fects of all other variables in the analysis.
Looking first at the unadjusted means, we
find relatively large differences in fertility
between Southern and non-Southern
cities, and between illiterate and literate
husbands and wives. Only moderate vari-
ation is found by husband's occupation
and wife's labor force activity. All of these
"zero-order" differences are in the ex-
pected direction with the exception of
wife's work status, which shows working
women to have somewhat higher fertility
than nonworking women.
When the effects of all other variables
are controlled, most differentials are re-
duced, suggesting the interdependence of
the various items of interest. Although
still in the expected directions, variation
of wife's literacy shrinks from 1.05 to 0.31
children; the difference by husband's liter-
acy drops from 1.19 to 0.39 children; and
the effect of husband's occupation is re-
duced from 0.49 to 0.37 children. These
1Any dichotomous occupational classification is certain to be somewhat imprecise. The scheme used here distinguishes between Black men engaged in laboring occupations and all other men. Of all laborers, 28were engaged in agricultural work and 172 were nonagricultural workers. The "higher status" category is a diverse mix of occupations not strictly laboring jobs. There is a fair amount of heterogeneity within this category, and some "nonlaboring" occupations actually may have a good deal in common with the "low status" category. Included in this group are 5 professionals; 28 craftsmen and foremen; 33 operatives and kindred workers; and 54 service workers. Service workers are the most problematic, and a case could be made for considering them "unskilled laborers." However, the majority of service workers were waiters and porters, and it was decided these occupations required somewhat greater training and "social skills" than the average unskilled laboring occupation.

results indicate nearly equal importance of the social status indicators included here and demonstrate the necessity of simultaneously considering several characteristics. Clearly, a misleadingly large differential might be attributed to one indicator of status if the others were not accounted for.
Though the independent effects of the three status variables are statistically insignificant, and rather modest when taken alone, it is useful to ask how certain combinations of the characteristics are reflected in differences of average numbers of children ever born. Dummy variable regression analysis was used to duplicate the MCA results shown in Table 1. Unstandardized regression coefficients and variable means were used to predict the average cumulative fertility for literate couples with the husband in the higher status occupational group, and for illiter-

ate couples with the husband engaged in unskilled labor.2 These calculations yield values of 3.49 for "lower status" couples and 2.43 for "higher status" couples. At the extremes, then, differences in social status among urban Blacks were responsible for roughly a one-child difference in fertility. Smaller, though still sizable, differences existed by literacy of the couple alone. Other things being equal, literate couples had borne an average of 2.63 children, while illiterate couples reported an average of 3.32 children ever born.
In short, it appears that social status was a fairly important source of fertility variation among urban Blacks at the turn of the century. Even the rather crude indicators available from the 1900 census manuscripts are associated with moderate differences in fertility--especially when considered jointly. The existence of social status fertility gradients for Blacks is consistent with similar variation found for urban whites (Kiser, 1932). Furthermore, when considered in conjunction with evidence that urban Blacks practiced deliberate family limitation in the late nineteenth century (Tolnay, 1981), such gradients lend support to the conclusion that nonphysiological factors were important contributors to the low levels of urban fertility, and to the dramatic transition in Black fertility which occurred between 1880 and 1900. In addition, a negative association between social status and fertility would seem to be largely contradictory to explanations which emphasize biological causes of reduced Black fertility, since poorer, less sophisticated sectors of the Black population presumably would have been

more susceptible to involuntary impairments to their fecundity.
SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AND URBAN
CHILDLESSNESS
Historical levels and trends in Black childnessness have attracted a good deal of attention. Childlessness has generally been considered the result of sterility, and involuntary impairments to fecundity have occupied center stage in explanations of Black fertility trends. Most discussions of Black childlessness focus on those cohorts who reached childbearing age during the depression and who reported levels of childlessness which have not been surpassed. Such fertility behavior appears to violate our assumptions that normative pressures require all women to desire at least one child. Consequently, physiological explanations are generally invoked to explain these high levels of childlessness. With respect to the initiation of the Black fertility transition, however, childlessness in the late nineteenth century is more germane.
Actually, the available evidence suggests that childlessness among Black women as a whole was not very different from white childlessness before the turn of the century. Cutright and Shorter (1979) have estimated parity progression ratios for Black and white birth cohorts from 1868to 1934. Examination of their earliest cohort reveals that 80 per cent of whites and 83 per cent of nonwhites bore at least one child. In addition, Farley's estimates (1970a, p. 95) for earlier birth cohorts suggest little difference between Blacks and whites. For example, among ever-married women born between 1845 and 1854,7 per cent of Blacks and 8 per cent of whites remained childless.
There was, however, substantial urban-rural variation in Black childlessness. Among all ever-married Black women 45-74 years at the time of the 1910 census,

254

11.3 per cent of non-Southerners or Southern urbanites were childless, while only 4.3 per cent of Southern rural residents remained at parity zero. When compared with levels of childlessness for native whites, these percentages do not seem unusual. Childlessness among native whites reached 11.3 per cent for urbanites and 7.8 per cent for rural residents (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1945, Tables 81 and 82).
Some idea of socioeconomic gradients in childlessness can also be obtained from tabulations for Black women from the 1910 census. Since separate information was not presented for urban and rural residents, the available data are rather crude. Nonetheless, among ever-married Black women 45-74 years of age in 1910, 10.6 per cent of all literates and only 6 per cent of all illiterates remained childless. Occupational variation in childlessness was equally impressive. Once-married Black women (45-74 years) living with their spouse in Northern or Western states at the time of the 1910 census exhibited the following differential in childlessness by occupation of husband (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1945, p. 173; 1947, pp. 210-211): professional and semiprofessional workers, 35.7 per cent childless; clerical workers, 20.7 per cent childless; and laborers (except farm and mine), 15.3 per cent childless.
Undoubtedly, some childlessness for both races was due to primary sterility and subfecundity. However, to attribute childlessness among Blacks to involuntary factors alone, when the levels and urbanrural differentials were very similar to those for native whites, seems unwarranted. Childlessness is, without question, an extreme form of fertility control. Nevertheless, several researchers have concluded that a good deal of childlessness in modern societies is voluntary (Cutright and Polonko, 1977; Freshnock and Cu-

tright, 1978; Poston, 1976; Veevers, 1971). And, very recent research has suggested that even among nineteenthcentury native white women, a substantial proportion of childlessness was by deliberate design rather than involuntary (Tolnay and Guest, 1982). Moreover, McFalls and Masnick (1981) have shown that among Black women born between 1916 and 1920, childless women were the first to begin contracepting after the initiation of regular intercourse--indicating a deliberate effort to avoid pregnancy.
In this section we explore further the nature of childlessness among urban Blacks in the late nineteenth century. Obviously, without information about fertility intentions and reproductive capacity, we can not decisively determine whether most childlessness was voluntary or involuntary. It is possible, however, to describe socioeconomic differentials in childlessness, and to assess their consistency with arguments which claim significant impairments to urban Black fecundity. Our sample during this analysis consists of all married, spouse-present, urban women who were at least thirty-five years of age and had been married for at least five years. Although some of these women may have had their first birth in subsequent years, it seems safe to conclude that the vast majority of those who were childless would remain so. The sample restrictions have severely reduced the number of cases (TV = 114), so caution should be used when interpreting the results. Once more, MCA is used, with childlessness (l = no children; 0 = 1+ children) as the dependent variable.3 Our principal independent variables are wife's work status, wife's literacy, husband's literacy, and husband's oc-
3Strictly speaking, Multiple Classification Analysisis not the most appropriate technique to use with a dichotomized dependent variable. However, similar results were obtained when log-linear methods were used to replicate the analysis of childlessness.

cupation. Region of residence and woman's age are employed as controls.
Table 2 suggests that childlessness was more common in non-Southern cities, for working women, and with one exception, among higher status Blacks. The regional effect is consistent with the South-nonSouth differential in cumulative fertility described in Table 1. And, while the influence of wife's work status on childlessness is also consistent with what we might predict, it is difficult to sort out causal direction. Childless women simply may have had more freedom to work outside of the home. Turning to our indicators of the social status of married couples, the adjusted means show that literate women, and women married to men with higher status occupations, were more likely to be childless. In contrast to this pattern, however, women with literate

husbands are found to have somewhat lower levels of childlessness than women married to illiterates. It must be admitted that we have no convincing explanations for the opposite effects of husband's and wife's literacy. It should be pointed out, though, that intercorrelations among the social status variables may interfere with estimates of their independent effects. For example, male and female literacy are correlated (r=0.60), and husband's literacy and occupation are correlated (r = 0.34).
In recognition of the intercorrelations among the independent variables, and since no single indicator is a statistically significant predictor of childlessness, it is once again useful to estimate the effects of a couple's social status when characteristics are combined. Using unstandardized regression coefficients and means from a dummy variable multiple regression analysis (including the same variables used in the MCA),4 and assuming constant residence, age, and wife's work status, we find 23.2 per cent childless for higher status couples (both literate, husband in higher status occupation) and only 13.5 per cent childless among lower status couples (both illiterate, husband in lower status occupation).
In sum, status differentials in urban Black childlessness are largely consistent with similar differentials in average number of children ever born. It would appear then that childlessness in this population was, to a certain extent, a specific type of reproductive strategy which responded in the usual ways to social and economic conditions; and that it was not necessarily a pathological condition explained by the unhealthful situation of urban Blacks.

course, involuntary sterility also must have accounted for some percentage of childless women.
MARITAL DISRUPTION AND URBAN FERTILITY
Although rates of illegitimacy historically have been higher for Blacks than for whites, the majority of births to Black women in the late nineteenth century occurred to married couples. When marital unions are interrupted, because of mortality or separation, exposure to intercourse and conception is reduced and fertility levels are likely to drop (Davis and Blake, 1956). Mate exposure has not received as much attention as birth control and fecundity impairments as a cause of Black fertility variation and trends in the past. However, considering the extent of marital instability among urban Blacks in the late nineteenth century, the implications for fertility are an important subject for investigation.
There is an extensive literature on the stability of the Black family following the Civil War (see Frazier, 1968; Furstenberg et al., 1975; Gutman, 1975, 1976; Moynihan, 1965; Pleck, 1972). While we will not review that literature here, it should be pointed out that marital disruption was greater among urban than rural blacks. Generally, the research dealing with Black family stability attempts to prove or dispel the notion that female-headed households in the twentieth century are a "legacy of slavery," and only rarely are the implications of marital disruption for fertility mentioned. Lammermeier (1973, p. 451) did note that among urban Blacks in the Ohio Valley between 1850 and 1880 "we find males heading more families of four or more persons, while women tended to head small households." However, he was unable to untangle the effects of extended households, widowhood, and fertility levels on household size.
In this section we attempt to assess the

impact of marital disturbances on the fertility of urban Black women in 1900. The sample consists of all ever-married women who were between the ages of 15 and 44 at the time of the census. The primary independent variable is marital status. We will distinguish between those who were (1) married with spouse present, (2) married but separated or divorced from their spouse, and (3) widows.5 Since formal divorce was so rare for this population (only 1.2 per cent of all ever-married women), separation accounts for most of the separated or divorced category. Again, the dependent variable is number of children ever born; and MCA is the analytic technique. Control variables include region of residence, literacy, work status, and age of the women.
Before discussing the MCA results, it is useful to describe the overall distribution of marital statuses in this population and to contrast it with that for comparable white women. Table 3 shows that only 66.9 per cent of all ever-married Black women were still living with their spouse at the time of the census--a considerably smaller figure than the 88.8 per cent of white women living with a spouse. The less frequent cohabitation among Black couples was the result of two factors. While nearly one out of five Black women reported a dead spouse, only 6.5 per cent of white women were widows. This is not a surprising result given our knowledge of higher mortality for Blacks near the turn of the century. Second, married Black
5The 1900census poses some problems for classifying women by marital status. Most importantly, we can not distinguish first marriages from remarriages. Obviously, those married, spouse-present women who were remarried probably spent more time unexposed to reproduction than first-married women with the same characteristics. Second, it is not possible to estimate length of widowhood. Consequently, we must lump together 44-year-old women who were widowed at age 43 and those whose husbands died when they were 20. Clearly, widowhood would have a greater effect on the fertility of the second group.

women with a living spouse were more likely than whites to live separately from their husband. Fully 12.5 per cent of all ever-married Black women (or 15.7 per cent of currently married women) were not living with their husbands. Only 4 per cent of urban whites were married but separated. This element of Black marital disruption was obscured in the published volumes of the 1900 census which reported only a category of married Black women and did not differentiate those with spouses present and those with spouses absent. Clearly, the degree of marital disruption described in Table 3 could have had a sizable impact on the exposure of urban Black women to intercourse and conception and thereby have affected their fertility.
Turning to the results from the Multiple Classification Analysis shown in Table 4, we find that marital status has a substantial, though statistically insignificant, effect on number of children ever born. The relationship is evident in differences between both the unadjusted and adjusted means. However, since widowhood was more common among older women, who also had had more time to bear children, the adjusted means deserve more atten-

tion. Other things being equal, women living with a spouse reported the highest fertility (2.94 CEB); widows had the fewest births (2.35 CEB); and separated or divorced women occupied a middle position (2.55 CEB). The independent effect of marital disruption, then, was to reduce fertility by one-half to six-tenths of a child, depending on the type of disruption. Considering the extent of such conjugal interruptions among urban Blacks, the implications for fertility are apparent.
That mate exposure was an important element of Black fertility trends and variation has also been inferred by Masnick and McFalls (1976, 1978). Their data have shown that the proportion of time spent in unions during the most fertile years (20-29) was positively related to the number of children ever born to the 1916-20 birth cohort. These two sets of findings suggest, then, that mate exposure (or marital instability) was an influential determi-

nant of Black fertility at the inception and the conclusion of the fertility transition.
Interpretation of the marital disruption effect is somewhat problematic. That is, it is difficult to determine whether the effect should be attributed to voluntary or involuntary factors. Most likely a combination of the two was at work. For example, while the death of a husband would be an involuntary factor, the wife's postponement of remarriage might be a voluntary factor and might be due to a reluctance to be exposed to childbearing once again. In addition, McFalls (1981, p. 10) has suggested that some Black live-in domestics may have been seeking to reduce their exposure to intercourse and conception. In the absence of more information, perhaps the best policy is to treat marital instability (or mate exposure) as a separate and distinct factor influencing historical Black fertility patterns and to recognize that it had voluntary and involuntary components.
DISCUSSION
A general understanding of the dramatic decline in Black fertility rates which occurred between 1880 and 1940 is beginning to emerge. It now appears that urban Blacks initiated the fertility transition and that birth control (including abortion) played a more important role than has typically been recognized (McFalls, 1981; McFalls and Masnick, 1981; Tolnay, 1981). The results presented here are from a "snapshot" in historical time and can not speak directly to the nature of trends in Black fertility. Nevertheless, it is believed that certain important inferences can be gleaned from our findings and the results of previous research.
The socioeconomic differentials we have described in Black fertility and childlessness are not unique--and that is noteworthy. In general, higher status urban

Blacks were exercising greater control over childbearing than were lower status Blacks. Riser's results (1932) would have us believe the same of urban whites during roughly the same period of time. Second, such differentials are contradictory to what common sense would tell us about the effect of VD and poor health on fertility. For example, McFalls (1973, p. 8) has noted that "childlessness in 1940 was most common among Black women of higher educational attainment. Such women would be expected to have fewer cases of VD and better treatment once infected. This is only one of a group of socioeconomic-fertility differentials which go in a direction opposite to that expected if the VD-childlessness [and fertility] hypothesis was valid." Clearly, the same could be said of the SES gradients in fertility and childlessness found in this study.
Our results also point to the important influence of marital disruption on urban Black fertility. Actually, our findings provide a conservative estimate of the marital-instability-fertility relationship. We were able to measure spouse separation only at the time of the census. Most likely, some married spouse-present women had experienced earlier marital disruption which was reconciled by the time they were enumerated. Furthermore, some spouse-present women were remarried widows who were not exposed to conception for a period of time after the death of their husband. Nevertheless, even our "conservative estimate" suggests that marital disruption deserves greater attention in the study of historical patterns and trends in Black fertility.6
6There were many possible causes of marital disruption among urban Blacks, and it should not beinferred that simple spouse incompatibility was the most important. A good deal of spouse separation was probably due to the migration of Black men seeking employment. Furthermore, some occupations, for example train porters, required the husband to be absent from home.

Black Fertility in Decline

259

It isimportant to recognize that fertility limitation byhigher status urban Blacks is not a sufficient explanation for the decline in fertility levels for the total Black population in the late nineteenth century. Throughout the period 1880 to 1900, the urban Black population never exceeded 23 per cent of the total, and higher status Blacks were only a very small minority of all urbanites. That fertility control haddiffused to lower status urban Blacks is strongly suggested by the large difference in completed fertility between all urban and all rural residents. Among women 45-54 years of agein 1900, rural residents had borne 7.63 children while the average family size for urbanites was only 4.45 children (computed from 1900 PublicUse Sample). Clearly, there were aspects of urban living in general which haddepressing effects on the fertility of all city residents--not just the urban elite. In addition, residence-specific estimates of Black fertility rates inthelate 1800's suggest that rural residents also contributed to reductions in Black fertility, though apparently rural declines were not the result of much deliberate fertility control (Tolnay, 1981). Both the specification of urban conditions which discouraged childbearing and the investigation of causes of reduced rural fertility will require additional research.

It may seem that wehave paid toolittle attention to theeffect of physiologicalfactors on urban fertility. Wehave chosen to emphasize the social and economic predictors of fertility for two important reasons. First, the 1900 census manuscripts really do not allow a direct assessment of the influence of biologically caused differentials in Black fertility (unless, perhaps, as they affect childlessness). Second, too little description has been offered ofsocioeconomic variation inurban Black fertility during the nineteenth century. We hope that this discussion will put Black fertility in better historical perspective andhelp to reduce theemphasis on its "unique" character. Undoubtedly, there were physiological causes of low fertility among urban Blacks, and most likely they also played some role in the dramatic decline in Black fertility. However, we should not lose sight of the social and economic factors which also were operating.
