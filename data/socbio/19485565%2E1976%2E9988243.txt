ABSTRACT: Life expectation of females in the United States exceeds that of males, but females' health while living appears worse. Based on self-reports of illness, females have higher incidence rates for acute conditions, and a higher percentage of them have a chronic condition. The paper examines sex differentials in mortality and morbidity for 1958-72, using national vital statistics and Health Interview Survey data. Thereversal of mortality and morbidity sex differentials in the aggregate is duein part to a distribution effect, diseases with a male excess being weighted heavily in mortality, but those with a female excess dominating morbidity. For specific conditions, sex morbidity and sex mortality differentials are usually in the same direction, the sicker sex being more likely to die. For several conditions, however, females have higher morbidity but lower mortality than males. By incorporating diagnostic data, these reversals are attributed to females' interviewing and illness behavior, rather than to higher physical morbidity.

The life expectation of females in the are also examined to ascertain if they are

DATA SOURCES
Mortality data are from National Center for Health Statistics publications (Vital Statistics of the United States, Volume 2, Part A, and Monthly Vital Statistics Reports) and from unpublished materials for 1970-72. Morbidity data are principally from publications for the na-

tional Health Interview Survey, conducted since 1957 by the National Center for Health Statistics (Vital and Health Statistics, Series B and 10).l The survey covers the civilian noninstitutional population of the United States. Mortality data cover all United States residents. The difference in coverage is slight, the survey population being 99 per cent of the resident population in 1970.
SEX DIFFERENTIALS IN MORTALITY
In the United States, the excess of male death rates over female rates has been increasing for several decades (Metropolitan Life, 1974). Enterline (1961) has considered trends in sex mortality differentials for 1929-58. In that period, the age groups 15-24 and 45-64 showed especially large increases in the mortality gap between the sexes, and Enterline identifies causes of death which accounted for the trend.
Recently, Klebba and coworkers have traced trends in age-specific mortality rates and cause-specific rates for 195069 (Klebba, 1971; Klebba et al., 1973, 1974). They find no appreciable change in sex differentials for crude death rates. But age-specific and cause-specific data show changes masked by aggregation and by faster aging of the female population in this period. For both whites and nonwhites, male excess mortality has been increasing at most ages, except the very oldest and youngest (Klebba, 1971, p. 27; Klebba et al., 1973, p. 30). Trends in sex mortality ratios for leading causes are reported (Klebba et al., 1974) and also show

persistent changes in sex differentials, which I will discuss. Trends in the size of sex mortality ratios have provoked recent attention not only for the United States population, but also for Western populations generally (Preston, 1970; Retherford, 1970).
Let us consider recent sex mortality differentials in the United States. What causes of death persistently show higher rates for males than females in 1958-72? Is male excess mortality for these causes increasing over this period?
Table 1 shows age-adjusted sex differentials for leading causes of death for 1958-72. Age-adjusted rates remove the influence of the female population's older age distribution and faster aging in this period.2 Sex differentials are presented in two ways: the ratio of rates for females and males, and the difference of those rates. The ratio is [Female Rate/Male Rate]. The difference is [Female Rate Male Rate]. (Placing the female rate first in these differentials is unconventional in mortality analysis, but conventional in morbidity analysis.) Table 2 summarizes the direction and trends in sex differentials over the period. Together, the tables show a strong female advantage (i.e., male excess) in mortality, which is increasing.
For all causes of death combined, female rates are only 56-64 per cent of male rates. Over the period 1958-72, the difference in rates has favored females strongly. Per 100,000 population, 343 to 402 more males than females died each year. The sex ratio has decreased and the sex differ-

1 I use the period 1958-72 rather than 1957-72. The Seventh Revision of the International Standard Classification of Diseases (World Health Organization, 1957) (hereafter ICDA) was first used to code cause-of-death in the United States in 1958. In 1968, the Eighth Revision (National Center for Health Statistics, 1967) came into use. The 1967 mortality data and July 1957-June 1958 morbidity data use the Sixth Revision. It does not differ radically from the Seventh Revision, but creating a time series of rates and sex ratios for detailed conditions is simplified by eliminating that year.

2 For every year 1958-72, females are "older," having a higher proportion aged 65+ (Grove and Hetzel, 1968; U. S. Bureau of the Census, 197%). This age difference contaminates comparisons of crude period rates. Also, the female population is aging faster than the male population. The proportion of persons 65 + increased 1.8 per cent for females over 1958--72 but only 0.1 per cent for males. This fact complicates analysis of trends in sex differentials, if crude rates are used. Age standardization eliminates both of these problems.

* The causes shown are the leading ones for 1969. They appear in rank order. In 1972, the same fifteen conditions were leading, with these changes in rank order: diabetes mellitus (6), certain causes of mortality in early infancy (7), cirrhosis of liver (8), arteriosclerosis (9), bronchitis/ emphysema/asthma (10), homicide (12), congenital anomalies (13). Eighth Revision ICDA codes are in parentheses after each specific cause.
t Under each title, three age-adjusted items are shown: death rate for total population, sex mortality ratio, and sex mortality difference, in that order! Ratio is [Female Rate/Male Rate]. Difference is [Female Rate-Male Rate].
t The rate is deaths per 100,000 live births. Rates are computed from Klebba et al., 1974, Table 4, for 1958-69. For 1970-72, numerators are from National Center for Health Statistics, 1974a,cJ. Birth denominators are from National Center for Health Statistics, 1974*,d,e.
S The rate is deaths under age 1 per 100,000 live births. Rates are computed from Klebba etal., 1974, Table 5, for 1958-69. (In 1972, congenital anomaly deaths under age 1 account for 64% of all deaths from that cause. See Klebba et al., pp. 46-47, for rationale of using former.) For 1970-72, numerators and denominators are from same sources as in footnote (t). For those years, the numerator (deaths under age 1) by sex is not available.

creasing (especially in 1969-72), and female rates are rising faster than male rates. Peptic ulcer death rates are decreasing overall, but more rapidly for males than females.
In summary, males have higher death rates than females for most leading causes, and their excess mortality is increasing in the period 1958--72. Where do females suffer a disadvantage in the leading cause of death? Only in their higher rates for diabetes mellitus (which are, however, edging closer to male rates) and their "catching up" in suicide and peptic ulcer rates. These three causes account for only 4.1 per cent of the 1972 deaths from leading causes and 3.6 per cent of all 1972 deaths. (Altogether, the fifteen leading causes account for 88 per cent of all 1972 deaths.)
Age-adjusted rates were also examined for five other causes of death for the period

1968-72.3 The titles are syphilis and its sequelae (ICDA 090-094); avitaminoses and other nutritional deficiencies (260269); acute bronchitis and bronchiolitis (466); appendicitis (540-543); and cholelithiasis, cholecystitis, and cholangitis (574, 575). These are not "leading" causes, accounting for only 0.5 per cent of all 1972 deaths, but they are of contemporary concern to epidemiologists and health planners. Male death rates are higher than female rates for all of these conditions. For four titles, the male advantage worsens slightly or persists over the period. For only one title (syphilis) are female rates coming closer to male rates.
In addition, age-adjusted rates were computed for fourteen more titles for
3 The age-adjusted rates are from unpublished
data, National Center for Health Statistics. A table concerning sex differentials for these titles is in Verbrugge, 1975, p. 16.

1958-71, to be compared with morbidity titles later. These titles are all minor causes of death. Table 3 shows that all but one title (arthritis/rheumatism) have persistent male excess rates for the period 1958-71. Nine titles show trends favoring females, compared to males. Only two show any evidence of a worsening situation for females, compared to males.
In summary, Klebba (1971) finds that male mortality rates rose for some important diseases in the 1960's, after a period of stationary rates. In addition, this analysis demonstrates that males' mortality situation worsened relative to females in that period for most causes of death. (The 34 titles examined encompass over 95 per cent of all 1972 deaths.) It is believed, but not thoroughly demonstrated, that changes in life-styles (smoking, alcohol consumption, driving) have adversely affected males more than females, and that these changes account for the deterioration in their mortality rates.
SEX DIFFERENTIALS IN MORBIDITY
An abundant and continuous source of illness data for the United States is the Health Interview Survey. Respondents report acute illnesses or injuries which required either medical attention or reduced daily activity in the two weeks before interview and any chronic conditions which restrict their activity or mobility. By confining reports to conditions which spur medical attention or disability, the survey data eliminate minor symptoms (those above a private threshold of feeling sick, but not severe enough to alter routine activities). Perception of such symptoms may vary sharply across social groups. Analyses of the data (Public Health Service, 1958-1962, and National Center for Health Statistics, 1963-1974) tend to interpret the incidence and prevalence rates as measures of physical illness. In that

spirit, I discuss sex morbidity differentials and their trends for 1958-72. Later, I shall argue that a social interpretation of these data is inescapable.
Like mortality data, the Health Interview Survey data encompass all disease conditions (thus, the full range of codes in National Center for Health Statistics, 1967, and World Health Organization, 1957). Also, they provide a yearly time series which can be compared with annual mortality rates. In the following discussion, morbidity rates are age-adjusted to the same standard population as mortality rates (see Sources, Table 1).
ACUTE CONDITIONS
Females experience more acute conditions per year than males do (Table 4). The female excess for all acute conditions varies from 9 per cent to 20 per cent between 1958 and 1972. Per 100 population, females have 17 to 39 more conditions per year than do males. For the five major categories of acute conditions, female excess rates persist for infective and parasitic diseases, respiratory conditions, and digestive system conditions.4 Their rates are 7 to 30 per cent, 11 to 25 per cent, and 6 to 38 per cent greater than males, respectively. In terms of differences, the gap is especially large for respiratory conditions. Per 100 population, females have 12 to 27 more acute episodes than males do. Females also have excess morbidity for "other acute conditions," even when reproduction events are deleted (41 to 70 per cent). Only for injuries do males have persistently higher rates than females.
The sex differential for acute conditions has remained quite stationary since 1958. In Table 4, the ratios and differences fluctuate from year to year, but they show no overall trend for "all acute conditions" and
4 There are two minor exceptions. The sex ratio is less than 1.00 for infective and parasitic diseases one year; for digestive system conditions, another year.

* In this table, causes are grouped so they match morbidity condition groups, discussed later. Eighth Revision ICDA codes used to compute

rates are in parentheses after each cause. This is the closest feasible match to the span of codes for the same morbidity condition (see Wilder, 1973,

p. 50 and Wilson 1973a, p. 49 for these codes). Seventh Revision ICDA codes used for the mortality rates are available from the author. t "F*1 denotes improving position of females relative to males. "M" denotes improving position of males relative to females. "No trend (FT

denotes a female advantage which is maintained over the period, but shows no trend.

t Under each title, three age-adjusted items are shown: death rate for female population, sex mortality ratio, and sex mortality difference, in

that order. Ratio is [Female Rate/Male Rate], Difference is [Female Rate -Male Rate).

§ The span of codes used to compute rates differs for the Seventh and Eighth Revisions of ICDA. This computation artifact, plus any real

changes in diagnosis of these causes, produces marked differences in rates and sex differentials between 1958-67 (Seventh Revision) and 1968-71

(Eighth Revision). 1 This title includes a leading cause of death (influenza/pneumonia in the respiratory group; cirrhosis of liver in the digestive group; and

accidents, suicide, homicide in injuries). The title is not counted in the text discussion of this table.

# Beginning in 1962, the number of deaths diagnosed as ICDA (511-517, 520, 522-527.0, 527.2) drop sharply. Consequently, rates drop and

sex differentials change for 1962-67.

the five categories. (One might claim a slight improvement among males for "other acute conditions" relative to females, but the evidence is slender.) In light of males' worsening mortality situation, should we expect a declining female excess in acute conditions? No, since the deterioration in male mortality is occuring mainly for chronic conditions (Klebba, 1971).5

5 There is an interesting, though small, trend in

sex differentials for, respiratory conditions. Female

rates show a slight improvement, compared to male

rates. (Both the sex ratio and sex difference de-

crease.) Recall that mortality data show, a relative

improvement among females for bronchitis/emphy-

sema/asthma. Most deaths occur from chronic forms

of these titles, but acute conditions are often precur-

sors of chronic ones. There is suggestive agreement in

these trends.

CHRONIC CONDITIONS
Per cent with chronic condition and per cent limited by it.--Chronic conditions are more prevalent among females than males, but they are more consequential for males. For 1957-67, Table S shows that a higher per cent of females have a chronic condition in each period measured. However, having a chronic ailment tends to be more limiting for males. In all years measured, a higher per cent of them are completely unable to carry on the major activity for their age group. Looking at age-specific prevalence, the difference is small for youths under age 17 and widens for every successive age group. At

t This category includes persons who have trouble getting around alone, who cannot get around alone (and need help to do so), and who are confined to their houses.

ages 65+, the gap is remarkable, with 9 to

21 per cent more males than females

completely unable to do strenuous work of

any kind. In 1972, 28 per cent of all men

aged 65+ were disabled to that extent,

compared to only 8 per cent of women that

age. The relationship between a chronic

condition and activity limitation are com-

plex. Illness may restrict activity. But

some people change their roles to accom-

modate an illness, thereby reducing or

eliminating activity restriction. If females

are more able to alter roles than males, or

their roles are less strenuous, thdreported

differentials could appear, even( if the sexes have identical prevalence of physical

illness.

*v

How a chronic condition limits mobility

is a better measure of physical severity,

Age-standardized prevalence shows that

males and females are similarly hampered

in their mobility by chronic conditions. But the standardization masks different patterns of the age-specific rates: Under age IS, the sexes are equally limited. At ages 15-44 and 45-64, more males are limited, suggesting they have more severe conditions. At ages 65+, more females are limited. However, the higher prevalence at ages 65+ may simply reflect females' older age distribution, rather than more severe conditions at the same (elderly) age as males. Overall, the pattern of agespecific rates suggests that females' chronic conditions are less severe than males'.
Over the period 1957-72, the situation for females has been improving relative to males. Both sexes show increasing per cents with a chronic condition, but that per cent is rising faster for males than females. Thus, males' advantage in this regard is decreasing. The sex difference in

per cent unable to do their major activity is widening, the per cent of limited males rising quite sharply. Age-specific mobility limitation data (not shown) reveal an increasing per cent of older males (45+) with some mobility limitation, but a stable or decreasing per cent of limited females.
Prevalence of specific chronic conditions.--Age-adjusted prevalence rates were computed for selected diseases and impairments which limit major activity. When symptoms compel such restriction, we can confidently assume that the respondent is indeed physically ill and, with less confidence, that he/she has named the disease correctly.
Of the 25 conditions with data for 1959-70, the majority (15) have a male excess, which is shown in Table 6 by a sex ratio below 1.00. These are principal chronic conditions. Fifty-six per cent of all people limited by chronic conditions in 1969-70 reported one of them. Including three conditions with data for 1969-70 only and which show a male excess (cerebrovascular diseases, emphysema, hay fever), the figure is 62 per cent. Excess rates are largest for peptic ulcer, hernia, and other respiratory conditions (which include chronic influenza, pneumonia, pulmonary congestion), the prevalence rates often being more than twice those of females.
Eight of the remaining conditions have a female excess. Among people limited by chronic conditions in 1969-70, 32 per cent reported one of them. Including one condition with data for 1969-70 only (diseases of kidney and ureter), the figure is 33 per cent. The female disadvantage is most pronounced for benign/unspecified neoplasms, hypertension, varicose veins, and genitourinary conditions.
Two conditions show no persistent sex difference: malignant neoplasms and "other circulatory system conditions."
In summary, when we consider chronic

ailments that force a person to restrict activity, a pronounced male excess appears for the majority of conditions. Among them are several leading causes of death. Females have excess morbidity for one important killer (diabetes mellitus) and for less fatal conditions such as mental/nervous conditions, varicose veins, arthiritis/ rheumatism, and genitourinary conditions--causes of much greater morbidity than mortality.
Between 1959-70, there are few discernible trends in sex differentials for chronic conditions. In both the sex ratio and sex difference, females appear to be "catching up" to males in prevalence of hernias. (Hernia rates have decreased, but less rapidly for females than for males.) An opposite trend: Males' rates of visual impairments are worsening relative to females'. (Their prevalence rates have increased; females' have decreased.) The overall male excess in morbidity is maintained. This stability is surprising; it does not agree with mortality trends for chronic diseases (Klebba, 1971). The poor match of these trends has no obvious explanation.
Summary of Sex Morbidity Differentials.--Excess female morbidity is found for most acute conditions and for prevalence of chronic conditions generally. But excess male morbidity appears for six chronic conditions which cause high mortality: diseases of heart, cerebrovascular diseases, "other respiratory system conditions" (which include influenza and pneumonia), bronchitis/emphysema/asthma, peptic ulcer, and impairments (which include congenital anomalies).6 It appears also for an acute condition (injuries) associated with high mortality (deaths from accidents, suicide, and homicide). Moreover, males seem to have more severe chronic conditions.
6 For cerebrovascular diseases, data for only one period are available.

In the period 1958-72, females' excess for acute conditions shows no sign of diminishing, but males' excess for chronic conditions is generally worsening. Males are increasingly likely to have a chronic condition and their limitation is increasing, relative to females. Male excess morbidity from chronic conditions which are principal killers is stable, showing no signs of increase.
COMPARING MORBIDITY
AND MORTALITY
Aggregated mortality data show higher death rates for males. Disaggregation shows their higher rates from most causes of death. Aggregate incidence and prevalence data for morbidity show that females are "sicker," but disaggregation reveals some prominent conditions with higher male rates than female rates. (It is important to note that disaggregated data for chronic conditions refer to limiting conditions. Aggregated limiting chronic conditions do show a male excess.) This urges a comparison of cause-specific rates of morbidity and mortality. For specific conditions, does the sex with higher illness rates also have higher death rates? Or are there reversals, the sicker sex somehow having a mortality advantage?
The answer to this should inform us about the reversal of sex differentials in the aggregate (higher female morbidity, higher male mortality). The sex differential for "all causes," or "all conditions," is a function of cause-specific sex differentials and of weights reflecting the relative frequency of cause-specific deaths, or illnesses, within each sex. The aggregate reversal may be due to (a) different weighting of illness conditions and causes of death to produce the aggregate rates or (b) reversals in cause-specific rates (one sex sicker, but the other more likely to die), or (c) both.

Although both mortality and morbidity data use the International Standard Classification of Diseases (ICDA) codes, their aggregation differs in published reports. Moreover, many mortality titles do not differentiate acute and chronic forms of a disease; they are combined in a single title. These two features hamper comparison of morbidity and mortality data. The closest possible match of morbidity and mortality titles was made, and sex differentials for age-standardized rates were compared. Because morbidity tabulations have less detail than mortality data, it was often necessary to aggregate cause-ofdeath titles and to compute agestandardized rates for that aggregation (an unusual one, from the perspective of mortality tabulations). While this procedure minimizes the first problem above, the second problem has no solution, and many cause-of-death titles are counted twice in the table. Because of that difficulty, the effect of the two factors noted above (weights and component sex differentials) on the aggregate sex differentials cannot be separated quantitatively.
Table 7 compares sex differentials for matched morbidity and mortality titles. The 27 titles in Table 7 are the standard titles for acute and chronic morbidity tabulations (see titles in Table 6 and Wilson, 1973a, p. 49). (They are necessarily used because of their greater aggregation than mortality titles.)
For 22 titles, the match of ICDA codes for morbidity and mortality rates is perfect or near-perfect. For S titles, the match is quite close, but the span of mortality codes exceeds the morbidity codes, or vice versa.
Consider first the perfect-match and near-match titles which show that the same sex is disadvantaged for both morbidity and mortality. These twelve titles accounted for 54 per cent of all deaths in 1970. Including the imperfect-match titles which show no sex reversal, the titles ac-

* Three condition groups do not appear in this table: morbidity data for "hay fever (without asthma)" and "chronic sinusitis" are available only for 1969-70. Before that, tiiese illness titles are included in "asthma" and "chronic bronchitis," respectively. Mortality data for "hay fever" and "chronic sinusitis" are available for 1968-71, but not by age. Also excluded is "all other acute conditions": The specific range of ICDA codes is not given in morbidity tabulations. The title spans numerous codes, and no mortality rates were computed. The title has female excess morbidity for all years (average ratio = 1.52, average difference = +100.3).

t Ratio is (Female Rate/Male Rate]. Difference is (Female Rate - Male Rate). For morbidity, difference is expressed as persons limited by condition per 1,000 population. For mortality, data are death rates per 100,000 population.

count for 67 per cent of all 1970 deaths. Altogether, these fifteen titles include ten leading causes of death: diseases of heart, cerebrovascular disease, (chronic) influenza and pneumonia, diabetes mellitus, (chronic) bronchitis/emphysema/asthma, and peptic ulcer. Accidents, suicide, and homicide are causes of death attached to injuries; congenital anomalies, to impairments. Most of the fifteen titles are chronic conditions.
Sex reversals appear for seven perfect/near-match titles. In all cases, females have higher morbidity rates but lower mortality rates. These titles accounted for only 6 per cent of all deaths in 1970. (Digestive system codes are counted only once in that figure.) Acute conditions are prominent in these titles. Two imperfectly matched titles show a sex reversal: varicose veins and acute respiratory conditions. The former is a "true" reversal. Since 1968, the number of deaths by sex for each ICDA code is published. The crude death rate for varicose vein conditions (ICDA 454, 456) is very small, but it is greater for males than females. Whether

the reversal for acute respiratory conditions is true cannot be determined, since the attached ICDA codes include many conditions which are usually chronic and rarely acute as causes of death.
Finally, there are two conditions which sometimes have male excess morbidity, sometimes female, but consistently have male excess mortality. One condition has female excess morbidity, but no persistent sex differential for mortality. Strangely, malignant and benign/unspecified neoplasms are two of these "mixed" cases. Their differentials are consistent with the hypothesis that females' greater utilization of health services (Aday and Eichhorn, 1972; Andersen et al., 1972) leads to higher rates of neoplasm diagnosis among them. Benign neoplasms are especially likely to be found. Males may have higher prevalence of malignant neoplasms, and their higher death rates would reflect that as well as late diagnosis (too late for control therapy). Benign neoplasms seldom cause death, and the sexes show no difference in mortality rates for them.

(Cannell et al., 1968, pp. 7-8; Laurent et al., 1972, p. 12), a sex effect is introduced into the data.
Second, numerous social and psychological factors have been postulated to account for higher reports of illness by females and their greater activity restriction compared to males. Females may have lower thresholds for perceiving discomfort, whether for social (Mechanic, 1972) or biological reasons. Moreover, regardless of a threshold, females may be more willing than males to report a perceived discomfort (Barker, 1953; Chesler, 1972; Ehrenreich and English, 1973; Mechanic, 196S; Phillips and Segal, 1969). In addition, females may be socialized (more so than males) to take curative measures when ill (Chesler, 1972). Females have generally fewer time constraints than males, which allows them to seek medical attention and to restrict activity more readily than males. When illness data are limited to conditions which caused such attention or restriction, an important sex differential automatically enters the data (Mechanic and Newton, 1965). The Health Interview Survey rates for acute conditions and activity restriction from chronic ones are clear examples of this.
In summary, sex differentials in illness may reflect sex differences in four factors: interview behavior, illness behavior, acquired health risks, and intrinsic health risks. Sex differentials in death reflect primarily the last two. In general, the first two (reporting) factors operate to produce higher illness reports for females than males. The last two (physical) factors tend to generate higher illness rates for males than females. Data on life style and exposure to environmental and occupational hazards indicate that males lead "riskier" lives which cause higher rates of injury, illness, and death. Genetic factors which disfavor males have also been postulated, e.g., the protective action of estrogen

against cholesterol synthesis. Higher male fetal death rates and congenital anomaly death rates are cited as evidence of inherent male weakness compared to females.
The relative impact of reporting and physical factors on self-reported illness is not known, nor have sex differences in interview and illness behavior been specified, especially with regard to Health Interview Survey data. Nathanson (1975) reviews several reasons for excess female morbidity in aggregate data and suggests that fewer role obligations and time constraints principally account for the excess. No quantitative assessment of the factors has been made.
Let us now consider the nine conditions with sex reversals. When possible, an independent source with diagnostic rates is used, to determine if females are physically sicker than males or if their interview and illness behavior account for the excess morbidity.
Dohrenwend and Dohrenwend (1969) review evidence of mental/nervous disorders and conclude that females have more neurotic symptoms than males.7 These are the most common mental disorders, but they may not be the most limiting ones. Psychotic disorders, which show no consistent sex difference, are probably the chief cause of limitation from mental/ nervous conditions. Consider also data from the national Health Examination Survey. Adults filled out a questionnaire, in private, about 12 symptoms of psychological distress. For all twelve, women produced higher rates than men (Dupuy et al., 1970). The sex differentials are smaller, however, than for the Health Interview Survey. (Are males more reluctant to report these symptoms to an interviewer?)
7 However, males have higher rates of personality disorders than women. Both neurosis and personality disorders are antisocial responses, and sex differences may simply reflect different manifestations of stress by males and females, or even physician preferences in diagnosis.

Furthermore, research indicates a sex bias among physicians, who tend to diagnose mental/nervous disorders in females more than in males presenting the same symptoms (Lenanne and Lenanne, 1973). Assuming such diagnoses are reported in the health interview, the physician bias is perpetuated there. In summary, all evidence suggests that the reported excess morbidity of females is due to social factors. Why males have higher mortality rates attributed to these disorders remains unexplained. It is unknown if physicians have a sex bias in death diagnosis for mental/nervous disorders.
There is some diagnostic evidence for hypertension (without heart involvement). The Health Examination Survey found higher rates of definite hypertension among males up to age 54, but a female excess at older ages (Gordon and Devine, 1966, p. 13). Borderline hypertension showed a male excess at most ages. In contrast to these clinical data, the 1972 Health Interview Survey asked if respondents had the symptom "high blood pressure." Females show excess rates at all ages (sex ratio varies from 1.14 to 1.71). The Health Interview Survey data in Table 6 refer to limiting conditions only; there, the sex differential shows an even larger female excess. (A table summarizing the age-specific sex differentials from the three sources is available from the author.) The evidence clearly implies that females are more likely than males to report hypertensive symptoms (because of earlier knowledge of it, greater cooperation during the interview, or less proxy response) and are especially likely to restrict activity for it. The inflation of female reports occurs at all ages, even the oldest when females do have higher clinical rates of hypertension.
No diagnostic rates for the total United States population have been found for

"other digestive system conditions."8 In 1968, the Health Interview Survey asked about symptoms of digestive conditions (Wilson, 19736). Seven disorders queried are titles in "other digestive system conditions": functional and symptomatic upper gastrointestinal disorders, gallbladder conditions, chronic enteritis and ulcerative colitis, gastritis and duodenitis, frequent constipation, intestinal conditions, and liver conditions (which include cirrhosis of liver). For all but one of them, females reported higher morbidity for adult ages. The sex ratios are roughly of the same magnitude found in Table 6. Do females inflate reports of digestive symptoms, and of limitation from them, despite a true male excess in physical morbidity? The data are insufficient for us to know.
No clinical data for the total population have been located for varicose veins. However, chronic circulatory conditions were a special topic in the 1972 Health Interview Survey. For varicose veins, the age-standardized sex ratio is 3.88, larger than the ratios for limiting conditions (average 2.SS). This symptom excess appears for all age groups. Apparently, females readily report varicose veins, but afflicted females are less likely to be restricted by the ailment than afflicted males. Do males have higher prevalence, which is entirely masked by female reporting? Or, are male prevalence rates lower but their conditions more severe, resulting in higher mortality? The evidence is insufficient for us to choose one of these explanations.
No clinical data for the total population were located for diseases of kidney and ureter, or titles in "other genitourinary conditions" which apply to both sexes. The 1973 Health Interview Survey
8 There is some diagnostic evidence for teeth disorders, which are a small component of "other digestive system conditions." For most ages, a larger per cent of females than males have diagnosed periodontal disease (Kelly and VanKirk, 1965).

queried genitourinary symptoms. When results are published, a comparison of sex differentials for symptoms and limiting symptoms (Table 6) can be made for these two condition groups.
Finally, sex differentials in physical morbidity for acute conditions (infective/ parasitic, respiratory, digestive) for the total U. S. population have not been found. The importance of interview and illness behavior for these conditions may be especially great. Acute conditions are transient and uncomfortable, but they seldom force restricted activity. Chronic conditions are not easy to forget, and they often pose unavoidable barriers to activities and mobility. Sex differences in interview behavior and health socialization can be expressed more easily for acute conditions than for chronic ones.
In summary, for conditions with clinical data for the U. S. population, the sex reversal disappears. Males tend to have higher (or equal) morbidity rates and higher mortality rates than females. Female reporting inflates the health survey rates and causes the reversal. If clinical data were found for the other conditions, the same results might appear. But what if a sex reversal persists between clinical rates and mortality rates? This is possible, if the sex with higher morbidity (most likely, females) obtains earlier diagnosis and control of a disease or if the sex has an intrinsic resistance to degeneration from the disease. If either medical attention or genetic factors make female cases less severe than male cases, females can have lower death rates even though their prevalence rates are higher. This situation has not been found in the data, but it is plausible and consistent with females' higher utilization of medical services, as reported in Aday and Eichhorn (1972) and Andersen et al. (1972).
If female interview and illness behavior produce inflated morbidity reports, the

inflation should appear for all conditions, not only the nine with sex reversals. Indeed, if we look at the top panel of Table 7, sex mortality ratios tend to be closer to 1.00 for most illness conditions than for comparable mortality conditions (see tuberculosis, diabetes mellitus, heart conditions, chronic bronchitis/emphysema/asthma, peptic ulcer, injuries, and hemorrhoids). Possible, females' reporting behavior partially closes the gap which would exist in physical morbidity data:9
CONCLUSIONS
This analysis demonstrates a worsening of male mortality risks relative to female risks in the United States between 1958 and 1972. Trends for chronic morbidity also show an increasing disadvantage of males, compared to females. For the leading causes of death, males tend to have higher morbidity rates as well as higher mortality rates.
The apparent contradiction (higher acute incidence rates and chronic prevalence rates for females, but lower death rates) is readily answered by disaggregation. Acute conditions are the most common causes of illness, but are rarely causes of death. Chronic conditions are rather infrequent causes of illness, but are principal causes of death. The different weighting of titles to produce aggregate morbidity and mortality rates largely accounts for the aggregate sex reversal. Diseases with a male excess are weighted heavily in mortality. Those with a female excess dominate morbidity.
But sex reversals in specific titles are also a cause of the aggregate reversal. Examining these, we are obliged to acknowledge that the Health Interview Survey is a
9 The expectation that females inflate reports for all conditions is simplistic. Certain conditions may be more "embarrassing" to admit than others. If females are less sensitive to embarrassment, their reports will be especially inflated for these conditions, compared to males.

social record of illness, not a purely epidemiological one. Comparing sex differentials produced by survey and clinical data, the tendency of females to inflate illness reports is revealed. This inflation seems pervasive, appearing in virtually all specific conditions studied. How much this inflation is due to females' greater responsiveness in the interview, more selfreporting, higher symptom perception, stronger socialization about health care, or more freedom to take health action when ill is not known. The answer can only be found in individual-level data and through

the collective enterprise of epidemiologists, demographers, and other social scientists.
