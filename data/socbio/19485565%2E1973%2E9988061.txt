Twenty-eight years ago, Clyde V. Kiser pointed out the significance of the population problem in Egypt with the following statement: "From the standpoint of size, Egypt is not one of the critical areas such as India or China. On the other hand, the population problem of Egypt epitomizes in some respects those of the past Mohammedan world and particularly for that reason is worthy of study" (Kiser, 1944, p. 383). At that time, the population of Egypt was slightly over sixteen million. Today, the population of the Arab Republic of Egypt (A.R.E.) is more than twice the size it was when Riser's article was published. The population of the A.R.E. on July 1, 1970, was officially estimated at roughly thirtythree million (Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics, 1971, p. 22).
The published literature on demographic analyses of the population of the A.R.E. is extensive (see for instance, Abu-Lughod, 1965; El-Badry, 19SS, 19S6, and 1965; Rizk, 1959, 1963; Zikry, 1963, 1964; Hassan and El-Kholy, 1966; Tappozada, 1968; Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics, 1966; Abdel-Aty, 1961; Shanawany, 1969; Population Council, 1967; Ross, 1966; Jones and Mauldin, 1967; ElKmmash, 1968; Issawi, 1963). These anal-

yses, however, do not possess the specific qualities of the present analysis which is unique with regard to its analytical approach.
The purpose of this paper is to study fertility differentials in the A.R.E. and to provide a meaningful interpretation of the observed differentials by occupation of husbands and education of wives. In assuming this task, the paper sets forth to investigate the question of whether, and to what extent, these fertility differentials are genuine or spurious, and, if genuine, through what mechanism they operate. In order to achieve these objectives, the 1960 population data on reproduction by educational status of married women, their duration of marriage, and the occupation of their present husbands are utilized.
The A.R.E. has been taking decennial population censuses since 1897, the last of which was taken on September 21, I960.1 Only two of the seven censuses produced data that could be utilized for the study of fertility differentials, namely the censuses of 1947 and 1960. However, it was the 1960 census that produced, for the first time,
1 A sample population census was undertaken in 1966 whose detailed returns have not been released because of its dubious quality.

data on fertility by educational status of married women, the occupation of their present husband, the duration of current marriage, and the age of the women.
The major hypothesis of this study is: If the A.R.E. has entered the second phase of the demographic transition, there will be fertility differentials between educated and uneducated married women, and between wives whose husbands are engaged in upper and lower occupational hierarchies (Cowgill, 1949). Theanalysis is divided into two major parts, namely, occupational fertility differentials and educational fertility differentials. Analysis of cohort fertility differentials is added in order to draw some definite conclusions as to -whether the differentials by occupation and education are being established.
OCCUPATIONAL FERTILITY DIFFERENTIALS
Husband's occupation is one of theimportant social variables with which fertility is associated (Campbell, 19S9). Table 1 shows that the average number of live births of Egyptian fertile married women in 1960 increased consistently in each of the nine major occupational groups as well as

in the "Notclassified" and "Not occupied" cases, as the duration of marriage increased. For example, women married less than five years had an average of 1.4 children, whereas those married thirty or more years had an average of slightly over 6.9 children, with the average for all fertile married women being 4.8 children.
Of the nine major occupational groups, the wives of sales workers had the largest average number of children (5.2), followed, in order, by wives of transportation and communication workers (5.0); by wives of service, sport, recreation, and related workers (5.0); by wives of administrative, executive, and managerial workers (4.9); and by wives of craftsmen, production process workers, and laborers (4.8). In contrast, the wives of miners, quarrymen, and related workers had the smallest average number of children of all nine known occupational groups (3.8), followed, in order, by wives of professional, technical, and related workers (4.3); wives of workers in agriculture, fishing, hunting, logging, and related activities (4.6); and wives of clerical workers (4.7).
As seen from Table 1, occupational fertility differentials in the A.R.E. appear to

be inconsistent with generalizations obtained from other studies (Misra, 1967; Tabah and Samuel, 1962; Freedman, Whelpton, and Campbell, 1959, p. 134). The fertility of women married to one top white-collar group--administrative, executive, and managerial workers--is higher than the fertility of wives of farmers, miners, and craftsmen. On the other hand, the fertility of women married to one low white-collar group-- sales workers--is higher than the fertility of wives married to blue-collar workers, farmers, and service workers. In general, the observed pattern of occupational fertility differentials reverses the pattern observed in most other studies, where the fertility of women married to white-collar workers are reported to be lower than those married to workers occupied in other occupations. This raises two major queries: First, are the observed occupational fertility differentials, as they exist, false or real? And second, if the differences are real, what are the possible explanations for the observed inverted pattern?
To investigate the first question, a twoway variable of analysis of variance is used in which husbands' occupations are the rows (excluding the "Not classified" and "Not occupied" categories) and duration of marriage forms the "treatments" or columns (excluding the "Unstated" category), and the average number of children per thousand married women provides all data. The null hypothesis to be tested states no difference in the mean number of children of fathers in different occupations. The computed F statistic is 11.09, which exceeds the critical value of the F statistic at the 0.1% significance level for 8 to 32 degrees of freedom (between 4.58 and 4.21). Accordingly, one concludes that the observed occupational fertility differentials are real.
Identifying occupational fertility differentials as bona fide, one can proceed to specify the spuriousness or genuineness of

the observed inverted differentials. This will be achieved by adopting a coherent classification of the factors likely to explain the observed differentials and by providing a more detailed analysis of the data.
Given the social conditions at the time the 1960 census was taken, the following factors could shed light on the origin of the observed discrepancies.
UNDERREPORTING OF BIRTHS
The estimate of underreporting of births in the whole country, as given by El-Badry (1965, p. 145), amounts to about 5%. Underreporting is said to be higher in rural areas than in urban areas. Accordingly, one may reasonably assume that most of the underenumeration originates primarily from rural residents. The farmers accounted for more than 50% of the total population in 1960, which means that the underenumeration of births in this group could lie in the 5% to 10% limit. An adjustment, say of 7.5%, for underenumeration would bring the average number of children per fertile married woman from 4.6 to 4.9, a figure closer to but still below the fertility ratio observed among sales workers (5.2 children) or transportation and communication workers (5 children).
MISREPORTING OF BIRTH EVENTS
Other lines of reasoning relate the underreporting of children, especially among farmers, to memory lapse and to the failure to report deceased children. In 1960, the census enumerators interviewed the heads of the households; when the head was not present, information for the census schedule was obtained from another member of the household. Inaccuracy of enumerators is confirmed from the large number of/'Unstated" (not classified) cases of married women either by duration of marriage, age, occupation, or education. For instance, the total number of "Unstated" married women

by occupation of husband and duration of marriage in 1960 was 87,169, or 1.8% of the total number of married women, and accounted for 54% of the total number of "Unstated" cases. The per cent of "Unstated" cases among illiterate and poorly educated women accounted for 97% of the total number of "Unstated" cases. Quite likely, the question on the census schedule obtained only the number of children living on the census date from many respondents and not the actual number of children who were born alive. Or, as Barclay (1958, p. 10) noted, "the live birth may be incorrectly registered as a stillbirth, or as a live birth with no record of death, or as an infant death with no record of birth; or simply not recorded at all, if the child does not survive long enough to become of much consequence in the community . . . .

DURATION OF MARRIAGE
For a given duration of marriage, the age at which one enters the reproductive union

is naturally of utmost importance as a factor in the final family size achieved by a woman. Moreover, memory lapse and the failure to report deceased children are anticipated to be positively associated with the age or duration of marriage. Hence, one would expect the underreporting to increase with the duration of marriage. Under this condition, the ratio of the fertility rate of farmers (suspected of strong underreporting) to the fertility rate of sales and transportation and communication workers (assumed to have more complete reporting) would tend to progressively decrease with the age or duration of marriage. In fact, the opposite is happening as is shown in Table 2. Whether this is true because of some other factors that tend to offset the underreporting effect at work is an open question,

one child) is of the same magnitude as for all women (fertile and childless), except for marriage duration under S years. This may be due to the tendency among farmers to marry very young women still in their prechildbearing years.
Added to this is the fact that in the Islamic culture a woman and a man are considered legally married if all legal requirements for that marriage have been achieved, even though they have never lived together as husband and wife. The census of population of the A.R.E. does not distinguish between those only legally married (who are not living as married couples) and those who are married and living as husband and wife. The number of new marriage contracts for Moslems in 1960 was 264,870, or 5.8% of total married Moslem females in the country.
To be sure of whether or not significant childlessness differentials are established among the occupational categories, a twoway variable of analysis of variance, similar to the one mentioned above in connection with occupational fertility differentials, is used. However, the results are not significant and the null hypothesis of no difference in the percentages of childlessness

among occupation is established. The computed F statistic is 1.25, which is exceeded by the critical value of the F statistic at the 10% significance level for 8 and 32 degrees of freedom.
This result urges one to hypothesize that childlessness is related neither to occupation of husband nor to means of birth control but to other factors, such as adolescent sterility, female age at marriage, and the prevalence of a significant proportion of dejure marriages (those who are legally married but not living as married couples). If this hypothesis is true, one expects an inverse relationship to prevail between the average number of children that a fertile married female has (Tables 1 and 5) and the proportion of childless women (Tables 2 and 6). As indicated in Table 4, the correlation coefficients are all negatives, except for duration of marriage under 5 years for fertile women by education and childlessness, indicating that the smaller the proportion of childlessness the greater the fertility will be. With respect to occupation, however, the correlation coefficients in duration of marriage under 5 and 5 to 9 years are not significant at the 5% level.
As an indication of fertility differentials,

however, the interpretation of these correlations is not a simple one. It is not clear whether the given proportions of childlessness are a reflection of the actual fertility level in a given occupational (or educational group) or are outcomes of some kind of selective process whereby women without children are exposed to a greater risk of divorce or suffer a lesser probability of remarriage once widowed or divorced. Further discussion about these correlation coefficients, especially by education, is given in the section on educational fertility.
INVOLUNTARY CHILD-SPACING MECHANISM
The impact of this factor displays itself in the low fertility of fertile women married to minors, quarrymen, and related workers. Many men occupied in this major occupational group leave their wives at home for extended periods of time. Added to this separation factor are lactation practices, infant mortality in as much as it affects lactation, polygamy, and postpartum sexual taboos.
HETEROGENEITY OF OCCUPATIONAL CLASSIFICATION
The relatively high fertility of the wives of the administrative, executive, and managerial workers is related to this factor. This major occupational group includes a large proportion of farm managers and village mayors who tend to be poorly educated and have rural backgrounds. In 1960, there

were nearly 60,000 married males in this occupational group, or 1.2% of the total married males in the A.R.E. Zikry (1963) concluded that these farm managers and village mayors tended to inflate the family size of this occupational group.
EDUCATIONAL FERTILITY DIFFERENTIALS
In the A.R.E., as in many other countries at a comparable stage of economic and social development, the majority of women are either illiterate or have little education. Their participation in the labor force is dependent upon moral values, their residence in urban or village settlements, and/or their educational level (Zikry, 1963; Weller, 1968; Stycos, 1965). Adopting these propositions, one can hypothesize an inverse relationship between fertility and the educational level of married women. Such a relation is thought to follow from late age at marriage due to educational involvement. Westoff and Potvin (1967, p. 3) in their study on fertility of women in colleges noted that "persons (especially women) receiving higher education develop interests and values that compete with the attraction of home, family, and children."
Average number of children per thousand fertile married women classified by duration of marriage and educational attainment in 1960 is given in Table 5 and portrayed in Figure 1. The results show that fertility in the A.R.E. is inversely related to the educa-

tional attainment of fertile married women in all durations of marriages, with a few exceptions of which marriage under five years is the most apparent. In this duration, the average of live births of the illiterates is smaller than most of the other educational levels. This discrepancy is related to the small number of fertile married women with doctorates (six women), the factors of involuntary childlessness (mentioned above), the "making-up and advancing of births" by women in the higher educational levels, and the tendency of some women to overstate their education. Information on overstatements concerning education is lacking. However, the positive correlation coefficient between average number of children per fertile married female (duration under S years) and percentages of childlessness (Table 4) provides partial explanation. This positive correlation (though insignificant) confirms the two major factors associated with involuntary childlessness, namely adolescent sterility and de jure marriages, discussed above. Thus, the obtained association seems as if one is running an association between two variables of which one (childlessness) is increasing more rapidly than its depletion (the state of

having one child); hence, an insignificant positive correlation. In general, fertile married women who received no schooling at all had an average of 4.8 live births, as compared with 2.3 live births to fertile married women with university education; that is, fertility of illiterates is more than twice that of those with university education.
A two-way classification of analysis of variance is used in order to test the authenticity of the educational fertility differentials as given in Table S. In this analysis of variance, education of wife are the rows (excluding the "Unstated" category), duration of marriage forms the columns (excluding the "Unstated" category), and the average number of children provides all data. The null hypothesis to be tested states no difference in the mean number of children of mothers with different educational levels. The computed F statistic is 7.29, which exceeds the critical value of the F statistic at the 0.01% significance level for 7 and 28 degrees of freedom (between 5.24 and 4.69). One concludes, then, that the observed educational fertility differentials are real.
The data on childlessness, given in Table 6 and related to education, provide another

among the educational levels, a two-way variable of analysis of variance yielded an F statistic of 6.36,which exceeds the critical value of the F statistic at the significant level of 0.01%. Accordingly, the null hypothesis is rejected, and educational childlessness differentials among married women are statistically significant.
COHORT FERTILITY DIFFERENTIALS
In order to draw some definite conclusions as to whether thefertility differentials by occupation andeducation arebeing pro-

gressively established, analysis in the temporary prospective would be in order. Such analysis, to be properly carried out, requires cross-tabulation by cohort and duration of marriage of women. This requirement is met by Table 7, which gives the number of live births per thousand married women according to their age and current duration of marriage. Approximate cohorts of mothers are obtained by merely subtracting mothers' agegroups from 1960, the census year (Whelpton, 1954, p. 16). In Whelpton's terminology, such cohorts

are called "actual cohorts" in the sense that each cohort consists of those Egyptian women who were born during a given period that permitted them to be grouped in the same age group. The same method is used to obtain year of marriage by subtracting duration of marriage from 1960.
In considering cohort fertility differentials, Table 7 reveals an interesting comparison between the fertility of late and early marriages for women born in different spans of years. Women of recent marriages (married since 1955 and after) have a lower average number of live births than those married earlier. The general fertility pattern is that, the earlier the dates of current marriage the greater the average number of live births per woman. Another generalization is that women married at older ages tend to have an average number of live births that is higher than that for women marrying early in the childbearing ages. Such pattern is a "normal" consequence for women who marry at ages closer to the termination of their childbearing span. At such ages, the sole desire of such women is the "making-up of births" which have been postponed by spinsterhood or the production of a family in the new marriage. In Egypt, as in most

other societies, children are believed by women to ensure the stability of their marriages by keeping the husband attached to the family (Blake, 19SS,p. 31). This provides one explanation for the excess in fertility of the earlier cohort groups who married since 1955,particularly the cohort of before 1910. A second explanation is that some of the women of earlier cohorts might have reported their live births from previous marriages in addition to those from their current marriage. A third explanation is provided by Table 8 which shows high percentages of childlessness, especially in the three cohort groups of 1915, 1910, and before 1910. The latter explanation can be also an indication of memory lapse.
All in all, the data derived from cohort analysis (Tables 7 and 8) show an elegant presentation of fertility trends of the earliest as well as the latest marriages of women born in different span of years. The important thing to note is that a greater number of children are observed to be associated with longer duration of marriage. Accordingly, the fertility level of married women in the A.R.E., as revealed by the 1960 census data, was a function of ageand duration of marriage rather than of volun-

Differential Fertility in Egypt

tary means of birth control. This hypothesis is supported by the gradual increase in the average number of live births per married woman of the same educational level but in different durations of marriage (see Table 5). The lower number of children produced for each duration of marriage as the wives' education rises substantiates the thesis that female education may generate "areas of interest" which compete with marriage or children (Westoff and Potvin, 1967, p. 120).
CONCLUSIONS
In summary, from the data on fertility differentials analyzed in this paper, the following conclusions are drawn:
First, occupational fertility differentials have been observed. However, the observed pattern of occupational fertility differentials reverses the pattern observed in most other studies, where the fertility of women married to white-collar workers are reported to be lower than those married to workers occupied in other occupations. Such an inverted pattern is partially due to defective data. From the data on childlessness by husband's occupation and cohort analysis by duration of marriage, occupation ofhusband appeared as insignificant factor in generating childlessness differentials.
Second, in considering educational fertility differentials, education of wives emerged as an effective factor in establishing fertility and childlessness differentials. Effectiveness of wife's education seems to be related to

the proposition that the majority of educated wives mayintend to participate in the labor force or in other activities that compete with child raising. Given this conclusion, onemayinfer that the A.R.E. is in the process of demographic transition.
Third, the 1960 census of population greatly underreported the number of children born to families in rural residents and to families married before 1910. Obviously, the underreporting may arise either from a misunderstanding of the census question or else from the fact that children who were not alive on the census date were not counted (perhaps forgotten by the parents).
Fourth, high childlessness among farmers, service workers, and illiterates is believed to be related to the tendency among females in these groups to marry in very young prechildbearing years. Added to this is the fact that the Egyptian census does not distinguish between de jure marriages (officially contracted marriages whose parties have' not yet lived as married couples) and de facto marriages which include all others who are living as husband and wife.
