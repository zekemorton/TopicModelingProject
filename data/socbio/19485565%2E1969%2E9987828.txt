Within the range of full-term birth weights, about 2,500 to 4,500 grams, fewinvestigators have found differential effects of birth weight on later intelligence. Studies of infants born at full-term weights seldom show significant correlations between birth weight and later behavioral characteristics.
There is little question, however, that low birth weights (less than 2,500 grams), especially those below 2,000 grams, can have permanent deleterious effects on later intellectual performance (Wiener, 1962, 1965; Drillien, 1958, 1961; Dann, Levine, and New, 1964; Hardy, 1965; Singer, Westphal, and Niswander, 1968; Williams and Scarr, in press). Incidences of gross neurological impairment and minimal brain damage are many times higher among low birth weight infants. Poor intellectual development in later life can be traced to poor intrauterine nourishment, anoxia, hyperbilirubinemia, metallic acidosis, poor metabolic functions, infections, and other forms of perinatal distress often suffered by low birth weight infants. Low birth weights have repeatedly been shown to be associated with later intellectual decrements, but birth weights above 2,500 grams have not shown differential effects.
The difficulty in studying the effects of higher birth weights in single-born children

is that so many other factors that affect intelligence are left to vary uncontrolled. Several pre- and perinatal factors of known influence on intelligence are genotype, intrauterine environment, gestational age, birth weight, and perinatal care. In any group of single-born infants, all of these factors vary widely making the isolation of the effects of any one factor very difficult.
CO-TWIN COMPARISONS
Twin births offer a real control for several potent factors. Twins share identical gestational ages, similar intrauterine and postnatal environments, and identical twins have exactly the same genotype. By using identical twins, one can pose the question: Given the same genotypes with identical gestational ages, what are the effects of differing birth weights?
Birth weight is a function of the individual genotype and the prenatal environment, including such variables as maternal nutrition, infections, adequacy of placental attachment, presence of complications and many other factors. Twins share the same uterus at the same tune, but their experiences in utero are not identical (Allen, 1965; Price, 1950). Differences in the adequacy of nourishment of twins in utero are known to result in differing birth weights (Churchill,

1965; Babson et al., 1964; Willerman and Churchill, 1967). The co-twins in the same uterus are subject to grossly similar prenatal experiences, but there are enough differences to produce different birth weight phenotypes from the same genotypes.
Identical twins also have similar postnatal environments. They share the same homes, same schools, and same friends as they develop. All the postnatal environmental factors which are known to affect developing intelligence have been shown to be very similar for co-twins (Smith, 1965; Scarr, 1968). Thus, later environmental factors, which are potent in the development of intelligence, can be controlled by the use of identical twins reared together.
Within identical twin pairs, Babson et al. (1964), Churchill (1965), and Willerman and Churchill (1967) have shown a positive relationship between birth weight and intelligence. The heavier twin at birth more often has the higher tested intelligence later. Churchill (1965) formulated an hypothesis of intrauterine impoverishment to account for the finding. During some pregnancies, he reasoned, deficiencies of nutritional ingredients, circulation, gas exchange, and waste removal interfere with brain development. One twin may suffer more than the other in the same uterus.
Many of the twins studied by Churchill (1965) and later by Willerman and Churchill (1967) were not low birth weight (less than 2,500 grams). Although they did not stress the point, the finding that lower birth weight is associated with lower IQ held throughout the range of birth weights in their sample.
The crucial question is then: How high can birth weights be and still show differential effects on later intelligence? Can infants of 3,000 grams be shown to have better tested intelligence later than those born at 2,500 grams?
This paper presents data on the effects of birth weight on later intelligence, con-

trolling for gestational age and postnatal environment. The findings replicate the Willerman and Churchill (1967) study and allow a more extensive interpretation of the results.
METHOD
Sixty-one pairs of female twins between the ages of 6 and 10 in the Boston area were extensively blood-grouped. Of these, 26 pairs were diagnosed as identical or monozygotic twins, and 28 pairs as fraternal or dizygotic. All but two of the identical pairs had a diagnosis of monozygosity established beyond the 0.95 level by blood grouping. Two pairs were diagnosed as probably identical by handprint analysis. One pair had to be eliminated from this study because they had identical birth weights-- and, incidentally, identical IQ scores. The final sample consisted of 25 pairs of identical female twins with a mean age of 95 months and a mean performance IQ of 100.5.
The twins were representative of the Boston metropolitan area in social class, religion, and ethnic origins. They were drawn from a larger group of twins enrolled in a longitudinal study conducted at the Forsyth Dental Center. The present sample included 20% of all monozygotic female twin pairs of the 6-10 age group in the Boston area, estimated from the frequency of twins in the white U.S. population (Allen, 1955; Karn, 1954). Every family contacted agreed to be tested, so that the sample can be considered representative of the larger Forsyth group and of twins in the Boston area. Additional information on the sample has been published in several places (Scarr, 1966a, b, c, 1968).
Generalization of the results of twin studies to single-born children is fairly easy if the characteristics studied have no connection with twinness. For example, hair color and PTC-tasting distributions are the same in twins and non-twins, so that results can be safely generalized from one to the other.

Birth weights are not equal in twins and single-boms, however. Twins are more often born at lower birth weights, both because of poorer intrauterine environrrfents and because of shorter gestations. While these conditions are not limited to twin pregnancies, they do occur more frequently. Care must then be exercised in generalizing twin results on the effects of lower mean birth weights to single-borns of higher mean birth weights.
While it is true that many twins have less than optimum intrauterine environments, many single-born infants are also exposed to the hazards of inadequate nourishment and premature birth. It seems likely that generalizations can be made from twins of birth weights less than 2,500 grams to similar birth weight singletons, given the same gestational age. Twins of more than 3,000 grams can safely be considered term pregnancies, and their results generalized to full-term singletons of similar birth weights.
TESTS
The Draw-a-Person Test (Goodenough, 1926; Harris, 1965) was used to assess performance IQ in an easy and reliable way. The scoring of the Draw-a-Person Test is proscribed in the manual (Harris, 1965). Interscorer reliability for the present sample was 0.93. The test correlates moderately well (about 0.40 to 0.75) with the WISC verbal and performance scales for the age groups studied here and is a recognized measure of general ability for children from 5 to 12.
Many other measures of activity (Scarr, 1966a) social introversion-extroversion (Scarr, 1965, 1969), and curiosity were completed on the same children. There was no relationship between any of these measures and birth weight.
Mothers' ratings of their twins' personalities and of their own behavior toward the twins showed no relationship to birth

weight. In most cases the differences in cotwins' birth weights were small (less than 300 grams), so that differences between them were not significant for the mothers even at the beginning. By grade-school age, birth weight was not thought by the mothers to be a significant source of variation between co-twins.
At the time these data were collected, no hypotheses about the effects of birth weight on performance had been contemplated, so that unconscious biases were unlikely to be present. Twins' birth weights were requested among a large number of background variables during interviews with the mothers. Mothers' recall of many facts about their children may be faulty, but they do recall birth weight accurately (Haggard, Brekstad, and Skard, 1960).
RESULTS
The primary data from both the Wilierman and Churchill (1967) and the present study are presented in Table 1.
The basic characteristics of the two samples were remarkably similar despite their total independence. Birth weights of the heavier and lighter twins differed between the samples by about 100 grams;mean age at testing differed by less than a year. For purposes of analysis it was possible to combine the data to increase the sample sizes from 27 and 25 to a total of 52 pairs of identical twins.
For the two samples, the birth weight of the heavier twins was about 2,500 grams and of the lighter twins, about 2,250. Less than 300 grams separated the heavier from lighter groups. As a whole, the twins had lowerthan-average mean birth weights, and less than half could be considered full-term infants (48 of 104 infants weighed more than 2,500 grams). However, three-quarters weighed more than 2,000 grams, which has often been thought to be the weight below which neonatal well-being is jeopardized.
Lower birth weight was found to be as-

sociated with lower intelligence in the two samples, regardless of their twin status. For the total of 104 children, the distribution of IQ scores by birth weight is significant (F = 3.28, p < 0.05). Children weighing less than 2,000 grams had average IQ's of 87 compared with average scores of 104 for those born at more than 3,000 grams. Table 2 gives the distribution of scores for the combined samples.
A similar table was constructed without the 14 Negro children whose extremely low birth weights, low IQ's, and unknown environmental circumstances made them difficult to compare with the other children. Among the 90 white children, IQ was probably related to birth weight within the range represented by F = 1.90, p = 0.10. Children weighing less than 2,000 grams had average IQ's of 91 while those born at more than 3,000 grams averaged 13points higher.

ship between IQ andbirth weight disappears. In answer to the question, both samples showed significantly larger numbers of heavier co-twins with higher IQ's in the grade-school years. Being born at a higher birth weight has lasting consequences for later intellectual performance regardless of social class. Table 3 shows the results in chi-square form.
The effects of birth weight on later intelligence were not limited to infants at birth weights below 2,500 grams, as might be expected. When heavier and lighter cotwins were compared at birth weights above

As many researchers have noted, however, this relationship between birth weight and intelligence is highly biased by social class variables. Both lower birth weight and lower social class are independently related to lower intelligence. To separate the effects of birth weight from those of social class requires a carefully controlled study of a special type (see Wiener, 1962, 1965).
The major controls in a twin study permit the following question: What are the effects of higher and lower birth weights on the same genotypes reared in the same postnatal environments? By comparing only cotwins, the social class bias in the relation-

and below 2,500 grams, the results were the same. When both twins weighed over 2,500 grams, the heavier twin had a higher IQ score about as often as when both weighed under 2,500 grams. Table 4 shows the effects of greater birth weight within identical twin pairs above and below term weight.
The size of the difference in measured IQ between the heavier and lighter co-twins did not vary by the birth weight range, but by the amount of the birth weight difference. As shown in Table 5, when both twins were above 2,500 grams, the mean difference in their scores was about 5 points. When both weighed below 2,500 grams, the mean difference was about 6 points. When only one cotwin weighed less than 2,500 grams, the difference between heavier and lighter cotwins was about 13 points.

the eight pairs with one co-twin under 2,500 grams had birth weight differences of more than 500 grams. This large discrepancy may be caused by transfusion syndrome, a condition in which one monozygotic twin bleeds into the other through an intraplacental connection. The smaller twin suffers a very poor intrauterine experience, resulting in later intellectual damage.
Transfusion syndrome has been shown to account for large IQ differences between

Birth order was related tobirth weight in that the heavier twin is the first born 33 times and the later born 19 times in the two samples, as shown in Table 6.

seems also to affect later intellectual development.
Since behavior is a function of thewhole organism initsenvironment, it is reasonable to find that better nourished, more fully developed newborns arebetter able to take advantage of the environment than poorly nourished infants and prematures. That these initial conditions have measurable lasting consequences is more surprising, especially when the conditions are not severe.
Identical twins have been used to show the long-term effects of birth weight when

Superior and very bright children are born at every birth weight, except perhaps the very lowest,but one can wonder how much brighter many children would be if their prenatal conditions had given them a better head start.
