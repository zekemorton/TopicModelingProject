ABSTRACT: Data presented indicate that the sex ratio of the Navajo Tribe has shifted since the 1940's and now shows a preponderance of women rather than men. The reasons for this shift, which roughly parallel a similar shift in the general population of the United States, are: (1) a decline in maternal mortality rates; (2) an increase in male mortality rates, particularly from accidents; and (3) greater out-migration of men than women. Some of the consequences of the changing ratio include: increasing proportion of young widows with dependent children; a growing desire for labor force participation on the part of women; out-marriage of Navajo women; and, in the future, the probable isolation of elderly widows who may become the responsibility of social welfare agencies.

The sex ratios of populations are significant for a variety of reasons; among them are that they affect the patterns of marriage formation and stability and the tasks allocated to males and females. For instance, the high male-to-female ratio in frontier towns obviously affected the pattern of life. High rates of out-marriage of Karluk Eskimo women have elevated the sex ratio in that population to 155 men per 100 women, clearly influencing the pattern of marriage and social relations for those who remain (Taylor, 1966). The enormous excess mortality of men in the Soviet Union during the past fifty to sixty years may well have altered the position of women in that society, with a very high proportion attaining positions that might not otherwise have been available (Petersen, 1969).
There are numerous factors influencing the sex ratio. There may be differential ratios at birth depending on such factors

as race, socioeconomic status, and birth order. In some populations, infanticide may have played a significant role. Differential migration patterns may alter the ratios both in the donor and recipient populations. For instance, Petersen (1969, pp. 264-265) has shown that nations in Western Europe achieved sex ratios below 100 by the end of the nineteenth century, whereas nations in Eastern Europe, from which emigration occurred later, achieved similar ratios by the midtwentieth century. Clearly, migration may not be the only explanation; war and improved health care may also be implicated.
We have already noted the impact of excess male mortality on the Soviet Union. Warfare has also been suggested by Ember (1974) to be causally related to the numerical predominance of females in tribal populations which practiced polygyny. In the absence of warfare, however, it appears that the sex ratio changes largely in re-

sponse to what might be called modernization. The decreasing risk of maternal mortality, the decline in deaths due to infectious diseases, and the increase in the importance of man-made and degenerative diseases all seem to favor a relatively greater reduction of female than male mortality (Omran, 1971; Cowgill and Holmes, 1972).
In Figure 1 we have displayed curves representing the number of males per 1,000 females in five-year agegroups in a variety of nations (United Nations, 1973). It is clear that in the industrially more advanced nations women tend to outnumber men at all ages beyond childhood, whereas in less advanced nations, men outnumber women in the middle adult years. In India's Hindu population (curve not shown), the

numerical predominence of males has been attributed to two factors: (1) the provision of more adequate medical care to young males as opposed to young females; and (2) high maternal mortality (Gopalan andNaidu, 1972).
In the United States, where the risks of death from infectious disease, maternal mortality, and warfare have not been high in recent years, the sex ratio curve shows a decrease in the number of males per 1,000 females with increasing age.This decrease is generally attributed to the higher death rate for males at all ages, particularly from traumatic causes and chronic diseases. The same general pattern is true for Japan, save for the dip in the curve at age 45-55. This dippresumably reflects the impact of World War II on that cohort of

males who would have been in their late teens and twenties during the war years.
Puerto Rico and Colombia each show a curve with an upturn in the middle adult years( thirties and early forties) and a downward trend in late middle age. This curve represents an increase in the proportion of adult males largely as a result of high maternal mortality among adult women who had experienced their childbearing years at a time when medical services may not have been as developed as they are at present.
We do not pretend that this discussion is by any means exhaustive. We have not mentioned, for instance, the probable excess mortality of young males which would account for part of the downward dip in each curve in the late teens and twenties, nor have we presented curves from populations where many men were eliminated by warfare or where migration may represent a substantial problem. These curves are presented primarily for illustrative purposes to show that males outnumber females at birth in all populations and to give some notion of the subsequent differences

in sex ratios between so-called developed and underdeveloped nations.
It is also important to point out that populations within nations clearly differ in their sex ratios. In Figure 2 we have displayed curves for the urban and rural populations of the United States and Puerto Rico. It is clear that the urban populations have a similar configuration, showing an increasing proportion of women with increasing age. The rural U.S. population shows an upswing in males in the adult years, but, it is never high enough to produce a predominance of males. The rural Puerto Rican population shows a clear predominance of males starting in the midforties and continuing until old age when women begin to predominate.
The two urban curves may represent the improvement of maternity services to urban women as opposed to those available in rural areas as well as reduced rates of mortality resulting from lower birth rates. The difference between the two rural curves may represent both the earlier improvement of U.S. rural health services as opposed to those in Puerto Rico as well as a

lower birth rate in the rural United States. In addition, it is possible that the urbanrural differences in each country may be accounted for by differential migration of women rather than men, although this does not appear to be the most significant reason.
American Indian populations have clearly been influenced differentially by the various factors mentioned above. Sex ratios vary from 81 males per 100 females among the Yabarana in Venezuela and Caingang in Brazil to 1SS for the Karluk Eskimos in Alaska and 180 for the Piapoco in Venezuela (Salzano, 1972, pp. 240-241). Eastern Pueblos in New Mexico have had ratios that have varied over the past several hundred years depending on a number of forces acting upon them. In 1798, at a time of high male mortality in warfare, the ratio was 80 males to 100 females; in 1890 when warfare had ceased but when health conditions were very poor and maternal mortality high, the ratio was 126; and in 1970 when health conditions had improved dramatically and male emigration may have increased the ratio was 94. (Witt, 1969; U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1973; see also Harvey, 1967). In this paper we will describe in some detail the changing sex ratios among the Navajo Indians, explore some of the reasons for the patterns that are emerging, and speculate on what some of the consequences may be. We will suggest that the patterns are related primarily to "modernization" and differential migration of men and women.
NAVAJO POPULATION The Navajo are the largest tribe in North America, with a population estimated at 131,000 (plus or minus 10 per cent) in 1972. In previous publications we have traced the tribe's growth and have suggested that it is undergoing a demographic transition much like that experi-

enced by many developing nations (Kunitz, 1974a,¿>). Their land base was expanded five-fold from the time the Navajos were first placed on a reservation of about 3.3 million acres. We have attributed their continued high birth rate to the fact that land acquisition allowed the continuing isolation of many families and low level of academic attainment of many individuals, the pastoral subsistence economy to remain viable, and large families to remain adaptive.
Since the 1930's, when overgrazing led to a forced reduction in the amount of livestock allowed on the reservation, Navajos have moved increasingly into wage work. In addition, improved health care has lowered the infant and maternal mortality rates and has been followed by a gradual decline in the birth rate from perhaps 45 per 1,000 to 30 or 35 per 1,000 population at present. Moreover, we have suggested that the decline in the birth rate has been a result of a decline in childbearing by women in their thirties and above rather than of a postponement or reduction of childbearing by women in their late teens and twenties. Because birth rates are still high (though slowly being reduced) while infant mortality has declined dramatically, the population has continued to grow rapidly in recent years, much as has happened in developing nations.
These changes have been accompanied by changes in the ratio of males to females over the course of the century. In Figure 3, we have displayed curves of males per 1,000 females (all ages) from the beginning of the century to the present for the Navajo, for all indians, and for the general U.S. population. In each case it is evident that the decades of the 1940's and 1950's were the time when females began to outnumber males in all three populations. Writing of this period, Johnston (1966, p. 175) has said: "It can be concluded that

ilar to the rural Puerto Rican population; and (3) the Navajo reservation population has a curve that is even more accentuated in the imbalance of males in the sixties and above.
In Table 1 we have presented maternal mortality rates for American Indians for selected years between 1940 and 1970. It is clear that the rate has dropped rapidly during that period, although for the Navajo it is still somewhat higher than for all Indians. In 1972-73, it was 60 per 100,000 live births, judging by tabulations we have been able to make from data provided by the Indian Health Service (Kunitz, 197'4b, Slocumb and Kunitz, ms.). By using these figures and making some

simplifying assumptions, we may estimate the number of Navajo maternal deaths between 1935 and 1970.
The Navajo population in 1935 is estimated to have been about 40,000. Thirtyfive years later it is estimated to have been 130,000. The midpoint average is 85,000. Assuming the birth rate in 1936 as 45 per 1,000 population and in 1970 as 35 per 1,000, the midpoint average is 40 per 1,000. Assuming the 1935 maternal mortality to have been about 1,000 per 100,000 live births, the midpoint is about 500 per 100,000 live births. Thus, the number of Navajo births during this period is about 119,000 and the number of maternal deaths is estimated to have been about 600. In itself, this difference is not large enough to account for the difference in population between men and women, which in 1972 was estimated to be 3,364.
Accidents are the major cause of death among American Indians. In Table 2 we have displayed the mortality rates from accidents for Indians and the entire U.S. population for selected years between 1935 and 1967. It is clear that the death rate

curve represents what might be considered a residual population, that is, a population that experienced the risks attendant upon migration, accidents, and childbirth at a time when they were substantially different than they are at present. They are, in effect, a cohort left over from an earlier period, and we would expect that as they age and die the structure of the entire population will change to one in which females outnumber males at all ages beyond childhood. Thus, the sex-ratio curve is likely to shift within the next twenty years to one which approximates in configuration that of the general rural U.S. population.
If we compare the Navajo reservation population to the rural populations of Colombia, Puerto Rico, and the United States as shown in Figure 5, we note that the con-

figuration of the curve is not so much a function of rurality as it is of what might be called "modernization." The rural Colombian population shows a predominance of males at all ages; that of Puerto Rico shows an upswing in the age group of the forties; the Navajos show an upswing beginning in the sixties; and the rural U.S. population shows an upswing in the adult years which never achieves a predominance of males.
It is perhaps reasonable to suggest that the changing configuration of these curves from Colombia at one extreme to the rural United States on the other is one index of an increasing rural standard of living, beginning at different points in time, at least as manifested by improved health services and changing patterns of mortality.

is, the improvements may have occurred first for the general rural U.S. population, next for the Navajo, then Puerto Rico, and hardly at all in Colombia. Clearly, differences in migration must be reflected here as well. If these curves are not stable over time and if they shift in response to changing economic and social conditions as well as in response to improved medical services, then we would expect that the Navajo population will increasingly resemble the general rural United States population in coming years.
We suggested earlier that the sex ratio had major implications for marital patterns and stability. In Table 3 we have displayed

data concerning marriages for reservation residents above the age of 14 and for all tribal members whether on or off reservation. The source is the U.S. census which, as we have already noted, seems to have significantly underenumerated the reservation population. The data are consistent with our expectations, however. First, of those who are married, about S per cent more women than men are married out of the tribe. Second, there is a higher proportion of women than men separated, wid-

owed, and divorced (see also Witherspoon, 1975, p. 115).
In regard to out-marriage, there is virtually no information on what becomes of these couples. It is the general impression of the authors that it is well-educated Navajo women who tend to marry non-Indians and that they ultimately move away from the reservation. We must emphasize, however, that this is only an impression.
The higher proportion of widows than widowers is not surprising given the sex ratios described above. What is less immediately obvious, however, is the relative ages of widows and widowers. In Table 4

we have displayed the distribution of people in each category by age and sex.
It is clear that the proportions of men and women who are single, married, and divorced do not differ substantially above and below the age of 60. Widows and widowers do differ significantly, however. Almost 26 per cent of the widov/ers are below the age of 60, whereas 42 per cent of the widows are below that age. Clearly, the high death rate of relatively young Navajo men has a considerable impact, especially since childbearing begins at an early age and many of their widows are likely to have children who are themselves relatively young and not yet independent.
We suggested previously that the sex ratio will influence to some degree the occupational roles available to men and

women. The employment situation on the Navajo Reservation is at least as bad as any place in the United States, with perhaps 60 per cent unemployed. In a manpower survey in 1968, an expanded definition of "labor force" was used to take this into account (Navajo Tribe, 1968). In national employment and unemployment figures, an individual is counted as within the labor force if he or she has been actively seeking work in a defined period of time prior to the interview. Because employment is so scarce on the reservation, it was thought that most Navajos would not have been actively seeking work. Thus, people were counted as within the labor force if they answered affirmatively the question of whether they would take a job if one were available. This liberalized definition makes comparisons with national figures imprecise. Nonetheless, Table 5provides some suggestive data.

Clearly, Navajo women are much more likely to be considered part of the labor force than are women in the larger U.S. population. The most important reason no doubt has to do with the general poverty on the reservation and the fact that many women would take a job out of necessity whereas women in the general population may not feel so constrained to accept a job were one available. Nonetheless, it seems

reasonable to suppose that a contributing factor to the generally higher proportions among Navajo women at all ages is the fact that there is a lower sex ratio among Navajos in the productive years (i.e., there are fewer men per 100 women among Navajos than among the general U.S. population) and hence a somewhat higher proportion of Navajo women are likely to be the sole or primary supporters of their families and are therefore more interested in working.
DISCUSSION
We have said that sex ratios are important in influencing patterns of marriage. Other factors are important as well, of course. Navajo marriage has been said to be traditionally unstable (Leighton and Kluckhohn, 1948,p. 96; Kluckhohn, 1962, p. 100). There is some evidence that stability is increasing as the extended family loses its importance and husbands and wives are forced to invest more in their relationship (Levy and Kunitz, 1974,p. 114; Shepardson and Hammond, 1970, p. 199). The same has been said to be the case for Hopi marriages, which have also traditionally been unstable (Nagata, 1970).
In addition to the pattern of serial monogamy said to be common in the past, polygyny was also not uncommon, the preferred form being sororal polygyny. Under the influence of the dominant society, and also as a result of economic forces which make it difficult any longer for a man to support more than one wife, this pattern is breaking down. Ironically, polygyny was more common at a time when men outnumbered women than it is now when women outnumber men and may have been a carryover from the time when Navajos engaged in raiding and warfare with consequent high male mortality.
Thus, both the increasing stability of marriage and the decline in polygyny would

It seems reasonable to suppose that many young women will begin to pursue careers of one sort or another as an alternative to marriage, much as has happened in some segments of the larger society. Finally, marriage to non-Navajo men will continue to increase in the future.

It appears to us that the first possibility is the most likely, because there does not seem to be much chance that employment opportunities on reservation will increase sufficiently to stem the disproportionate out-migration of males. Moreover, high mortality rates in this group result primarily from accidents, and that phenomenon is as yet so porly understood, its control so ineffective, and interest in its prevention so lacking that there seems small
