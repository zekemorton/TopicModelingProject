ABSTRACT:The present research focuses on childed versus childless intentions and subsequent behavior and intentions for a panel of U. S. women. Utilizing data from the 1970 and 1975 National Fertility Surveys (reinterviewed women), we ascertain the consistency between intentions (1970) and behavior and intentions (1975). We find that while women who expressed a zero parity intention in 1970 were very consistent in their behavior and intentions in 1975, nearly 30 per cent of those women intending children had no children by 1975. Furthermore, of these 30 per cent, one-third had changed their intention to zero parity by 1975. We find that changing intentions from more than zero to zero is associated with higher levels of education, slightly higher income, and to a lesser degree with the importance given religion and with labor force participation.

This study examines both expressed intentions and the actual occurrence of childlessness for a panel of U.S. women. While intentions, behavior, and the correlates of these intentions and behavior patterns have been the main focus of the childlessness literature (e.g. Bloom and Pebley, 1982; Poston and Gotard, 1977), to our knowledge no study has looked at intentions at one point in time and ascertained the behavior of those same women at a later point in time. Our goal here is to look at: (1) how consistent women are with regard to their expressed intentions for childlessness and subsequent behavior and intentions, and (2) the sociodemographic characteristics of women who express one intention or another at one point in time, with special emphasis on women whose intentions do not match their behavior at some later point in time. However, we first make a brief presentation of recent trends in childlessness.
Childlessness in the United States has varied considerably throughout this cen-

tury. From World War I until World War II childlessness tended to increase (Veevers, 1979, p. 7). Between 1910 and 1940 the proportion of childless ever-married women aged 15-44 in the United States rose from 16 to 24 per cent. However, from World War II until the intensification of the Vietnam War (1965) the rate of childlessness decreased to 14 per cent (Poston and Gotard, 1977). This rate was so low that some researchers declared voluntary childlessness to be virtually extinct (Whelpton et al., 1966, p. 163; Westoff and Westoff, 1971, p. 35). However as Veevers (1980, p. 156) notes, this conclusion was premature since even at their lowest point childlessness rates exceeded rates of sterility, leaving some childlessness to be accounted for. And, in fact, childlessness increased in the 1970's. Most recent CPS data (U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1980) show that nearly 19 per cent of all ever-married women aged 18-44 are currently childless.
Paralleling the increase in childless-

ness during the 1970's was an increase in reported expectations of childlessness, particularly among the younger cohorts of women. Three per cent of white wives aged 18-30 in 1969 expected to remain childless. However, childless expectations increased to nearly 5 per cent by 1975 (Veevers, 1980, p. 156) and approximately 11 per cent by 1980 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1980).
Nevertheless, predictions of childlessness or fertility in general based on expectations are problematic because "current expectations of births may or may not be realized in actuality" (Veevers, 1980, p. 156). This is evident in a comparison of the expectations mentioned above (3 per cent expected no children in 1969) and the subsequent rates of childlessness for the same group of women. The actual rates of childlessness have been considerably larger. The rate of childlessness for each five-year cohort aged 18-49 in 1970 was at least 6 per cent, much higher than the expressed intentions. Furthermore, the lowest rate was that for one of the two older groups of women included in the 1970 data (Poston and Gotard, 1977).
The increased rate of childlessness can be seen in both cohort (e.g., Hastings and Robinson, 1974; Poston and Gotard, 1977) and period rates (e.g., Das Gupta, 1975; DeJong and Sell, 1977). The cohort rates show that each successive cohort of ever-married white wives aged 15-19 from 1960 through 1975 had a higher prevalence of childlessness than the preceding 5-year cohort. For example, the cohort aged 1519in 1975had a 59per cent childlessness rate as compared to 54 per cent for the cohort aged 15-19 in 1970 (Poston and Gotard, 1977). The 1970 aged 15-19 cohort's rate of childlessness was higher than the 1965 rate. Though the rates for

both cohorts both decreased over time, the rate of childlessness for the 1970cohort was still greater when aged 20-24 than the rate of childlessness for the 1965 cohort when it was 20-24. Likewise, the 1965 cohort maintained rates of childlessness higher than the 1960cohort at similar ages.
This information is important in considering the possibility that the high rates of childlessness among presently young wives is temporary, as some researchers predict (e.g., Blake, 1974). However, as Glick (1975) notes, cohorts which delay childbearing seldom achieve the rate of fertility that would have been expected if there had been no delay. This is due to three interrelated problems according to Veevers (1980,p. 32). One is the decline of fecundity with increased age. That is, women who can physiologically reproduce in their twenties may find that their fecundity has declined or been lost if they remain childless until their thirties. Another problem is the fear many couples have concerning the positive relationship between the probability of a birth defect and the age of the mother. The third problem with delaying the birth of the first child is the socially accepted belief that older persons have a reduced tolerance for children. For these reasons much temporary childlessness becomes permanent. The result of this has been increased childlessness.
An increase in childlessness can also be seen by examining recent period rates. DeJong and Sell (1977, p. 131) show that the childlessness rate has increased for each group aged 15-30 since 1965. It can be assumed for each age grouping that voluntary childlessness has increased "since there is no reason to expect an increase in sterility among the younger populations" (Veevers,

1980, p. 157). These data also lead us to believe that presently temporary childlessness, to a substantial extent, will become permanent. Both expectation and occurrence of childlessness are increasing according to available data.
In the following paragraphs, we study a panel of U. S. women in order to find out more about the linkages between intentions and subsequent behavior. Specifically, we would like to understand better the process surrounding changes in intentions--from childless to childed and from childed to childless.

period of time. When we combine 1970 intentions with 1975 behavior and intentions for women who afe childless in 1970, in one sense the time interval increases. That is, in 1975 we have a measure of future intentions which from an analytic standpoint increases the time interval. Furthermore, as Veevers (1980, p. 161) points out, if we are to learn more about the dynamics of the children or no children decision-making process, a prospective cohort study isrequired. Despite its limitations, the data set utilized in this study meets that requirement.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK

The data sets utilized are the 1970 and 1975 National Fertility studies. While a great deal of description concerning these data has already appeared in print (cf., Ryder, 1979; Jones and Westoff, 1979), it should be recalled that the 1975 National Fertility Survey is longitudinal in design, that is, 2,361 women who were interviewed in 1970 were reinterviewed in 1975. In addition, it is also possible to match persons records for 1970 and 1975 (different data were solicited in each time period) so that one file results in a great deal of information. Of particular interest are some of the restrictions of these data in that: (1) only continuously married white women are included in the sample; (2) both the husband and wife can only be married once; (3) the duration of marriage is less than 25 years and (4) age at marriage is less than 25 years. All of these restrictions contribute an unknown amount of bias in the sample.
Using both the 1970 and 1975 data constitutes a panel study, though admittedly one with a fairly short duration. Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that childbearing occurs over a short

In order to analyze the various intentions-behavior categories of women implied above, we borrow the analytical framework created by Poston and Kramer (1981), though for our purposes it is somewhat modified. Figure 1 shows the decision tree underlying this framework. As can be seen, we begin with 274 women who are childless and not currently pregnant in 1970. These women are subsequently divided into their 1970 intentions, 1975 fertility behavior (i.e., have they had a child?), and their 1975 intentions. Comparisons of sociodemographic characteristics are made at levels (1), (2), and (3) (numbers in parentheses), though two cells are ignored due to their small n's. Nevertheless, unlike Poston and Kramer (1981), we make no distinction between voluntary and involuntary childlessness. Our childless women include both fecund and infecund women, although if the woman is infecund (not by choice), she had to respond "no" to the question, "If it were physically possible, would you like to have a child?" in order to be included in the sample. Therefore, the sample is reduced to 274. We are relying

On the other hand, virtually all the women (95 per cent) who in 1970 intended to remain childless in fact had no children and intended no children in 1975. Furthermore, of the 65 women who expressed an expectation for children in 1970, but had no children by 1975, one-third (22) had changed their minds by 1975.
In sum, these data indicate that while the intention to not have children is a fairly stable one, the intention to have a child is subject to change and even over what might be considered a relatively short time span. These data also add some explanation to the previous finding that childless behavior exceeds childless intentions by demonstrating that a significant proportion of women change their minds from expecting at least one child to expecting none. Now we turn to the sociodemographic characteristics which might lend some understanding to the pattern of intentions and behavior just observed. The characteristics selected have been shown to be correlates of childlessness in previous cross-sectional research. Because of a few nonresponses to questions concerning these characteristics, the «'s appearing in these tables are somewhat different from those appearing in Figure 1. All of the correlates in this study come from the 1970 person record.
Table 1 presents intentions and behavior cross-tabulated by respondent's age at marriage. Previous studies have found a positive relationship between age at marriage and childlessness (e.g., Veevers, 1971; Ritchey and Stokes, 1974); that is, women who marry later in life when compared with those who marry younger are more likely to bear no children in their lifetime. The data from Panel 1 of Table 1 are consistent with this finding. Panel 2 subdivides

Panel 1 by adding the variable parity 1975. Only Columns 1,2, and 4 are compared because of the small n for Column 3. As can be seen, women who intended at least one child in 1970 are more similar in age structure to each other than to women with a zero intention in 1970 regardless of 1975 fertility level. In other words, the age structure for women who did have at least one child in the 1970-75 interval versus women who did not is similar, given the same intention in 1970. Concerning Panel 3, women who changed intentions from some children to zero children are more similar in age structure to those women who intended children in 1970 and still intend children in 1975 than they are to the zerointentions 1970 and 1975 women. Overall, the variable age at first marriage provides little insight into the distinction between those women who are consistent versus those who change their minds concerning their childbearing intentions.
Table 2 presents intentions and behavior cross-tabulated by respondents' education. Prior research has shown that actual and expected childlessness increases with education (e.g., Panko, 1972; Ritchey and Stokes, 1974). The results presented in Panel 1 are consistent with these findings. The inclusion of Parity 1975, Panel 2, provides little information about the differences as women with the greater than zero expectation are similar regardless of 1975 parity. However, in Panel 3 a different pattern results. Those women who changed their intentions between 1970 and 1975 have educational levels between the two groups of women who were consistent in their intentions. So,if we wished to predict which women with expectations greater than zero would be more likely to change their expectations

to zero, we would guess that it would be those women with the highest education levels.
Consistent with the findings of Poston (1974) and Wolowyna (1977), family income is found to be positively associated with childlessness intentions in Table 3. In addition, small income differences emerge between categories in panels 2 and 3. Within the category of intentions greater than zero in 1970, women still childless in 1975 have a slightly higher income structure, and women who changed intentions from greater than zero to zero, have a somewhat higher income structure.
Panel 1 of Table 4 shows that as religious importance increases, childless expectations decrease though the differences are not large (see studies by Gustavus and Henley (1971) and Poston (1976) for varying results with different operationalizations of religiosity). By adding parity 1975, we see that those women who intended children in 1970 but who had none by 1975 find religion more important than the other two groups of women. Focusing on intentions 1975, it can be observed that the group of women who changed their intentions to zero children in the interval are more like the zero-intentions 1970 and 1975 women with regard to the importance, of religion than the greaterthan-zero-intentions 1970 and 1975 women. That is, if we were asked to predict which women who had intentions greater than zero in 1970 would change their intentions, we would guess that they would be women who found religion less important.

she also answered "no" to the question of whether she was bringing in any additional (in addition to the husband) income to the family. The data in Panel 1 do not support the finding of Ritchey and Stokes (1974) and DeJong and Sell (1977) that there is a positive relationship between labor force participation and childlessness. There is virtually no relationship between labor force participation and childless intentions. However, again we are concerned with intentions and behavior and not just behavior itself. The same very small differences appear in Panel 2, although in Panel 3 relatively large differences emerge. Women who changed their intentions in the 1970-75 interval are more heavily concentrated in the working category.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
This paper has shown that while the intention for zero children is one that most retain, the intention to have children is subject to change. One-third of the women who were childless in 1975,

but stated that they expected to have children, had changed their expectations to zero in the time interval. Furthermore, it is likely that a substantial proportion of the 43 childless 1975 women whose intentions are greater than zero will change intentions as well.
With a relatively large number of correlates of childlessness have been uncovered in previous research, there are fewer of those same correlates to the changing of childless intentions. Changing intentions from more than zero to zero children is associated with: (1) higher levels of education; (2) a slightly higher income; (3) a lesser degree of importance given to religion (4) labor force participation.
Though several sociodemographic variables have been shown to be correlates of intention changes in regard to childlessness, the need to include these variables in a multivariate structure is extremely important. Unfortunately, the current data set does not lend itself well to such analysis. Return studies of intention changes should focus on multiple correlates.
