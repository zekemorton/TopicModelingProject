ABSTRACT:The nature and extent of spatial variations in sex-specific cardiovascular mortality rates and sex mortality ratios are examined at the county level for the United States. The southeastern United States has the highest mortality rates for both males and females, while the central United States has the highest sex mortality ratios. When mortality is aggregated by levels of urbanization and types of migration for the United States as a whole, the pattern of relationship varies. The lowest rates for both sexes are found in large urban in-migration counties, while large urban out-migration counties have the lowest sex mortality ratio. The highest rates for males are in rural out-migration areas and for females in large urban out-migration areas. The highest sex mortality ratio occurs in rural in-migration counties. The decomposition of sex differentials in sex-specific mortality indicates that the sex mortality ratio is primarily a function of female mortality.

In the search for causes of mortality, studies have observed significant interregional, interstate, and intercounty variations in differentials in CVD and IHD mortality (Sauer, 1962; Hetcher and Bohani, 1965; Meade, 1979; Ziegenfus and Gesler, 1984). However, no studies have been made focusing on the spatial variations of sex mortality differentials. By identifying areas with high sex mortality differentials, we can generate hypotheses to determine possible causal factors. Sex differentials are the function of two components: male and female mortality. Different levelsof the sex differential can result from various combinations of male and female mortality. Thus, it is necessary to understand male and female mortality first in order to understand sex differentials in mortality.
In any analysis of spatial variations in mortality, two variables require attention, namely, urbanization and migration. Urbanization is a process of population concentration within a given geographical area. It implies significant differences in lifestyles, quality of physical environment, occupational characteristics, and accessibility to medical services, etc. These differences in living conditions are assumed to impact mortality differentially. It is also assumed that the populations of various geographic units have been more or less exposed to similar environmental risks. Migration, however, has the potential of altering the "at risk" population; yet the evidence to date on how seriously migration can distort geographical studies of mortality is contradictory (Polissar, 1980; Greenburg, 1983).
Rural-urban residence has traditionally been a useful parameter in identifying population groups with particularly high mortality risks (Keppel, 1983;

Greenberg, 1983; Clifford and Brannon, 1985). However, considerable variability exists in the extent and nature of rural-urban differentials (Clifford et al., 1986). The conflicting observations concerning mortality differentials between urban and rural areas may be a function of the units of analysis and/or of migration playing an intervening role in the relationship between urbanization and mortality.
Population change resulting from migration is related to the health status of an area by disrupting the demographic composition of the population. Most of all, the age structure of an area is affected by the age selectivity of migrants. Since migration tends to be selective of young persons, areas receiving large numbers of migrants are likely to increase the pool of young persons, who are at less risk of dying than older persons. Similarly, areas experiencing outmigration tend to have older populations. At the same time, the young can be expected to migrate to urban areas with extensive and varied job opportunities, while such concerns play less of a role in elderly migration (Cebula, 1979; Lichter et al., 1979; Heaton, et al., 1981). In other words, the net effect of migration may be changes in the age structure of the population which strongly influence the level of mortality. Of course, some of this variation can be accounted for by age-standardizing mortality rates. However, the base population may still contain a substantial level of bias due to the fact that migration also affects other aspects of population composition. Migration is selective of occupation, education, and income to name a few. Finally, migration independently affects rates of mortality in that the "at risk" population does not reflect the cumulative effects of its members'

exposure to environmental factors. Given limited information concern-
ing the extent and nature of spatial variations in sex differentials in cardiovascular mortality, the need for additional research is evident. This article attempts to expand our empirical knowledge by examining sex differentials in CVD mortality by level of urbanization and migration. The analysis focuses on the period between 1970 and 1980 and utilizes county data for the United States.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The mortality data base is derived from the United States micro death records from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), 1970-80. The population data base is derived from Intercensal Estimates of the Population of Counties by Age, Sex, and Race, 1970-80, prepared by the Bureau of the Census in 1984. Urbanization figures were compiled from the 1972 County and City Data Book, and migration from the 1975 Current Population Survey Reports. For mortality rates, complete data exist for all counties. However, the absence of necessary data prohibited the use of all United States counties in the analysis of mortality by level of urbanization and migration.1
Deaths to persons 25 to 64 years of age were included in this study for the following reasons. First, in counties with small populations at risk in certain age groups, even small numbers of deaths can produce large fluctuations in death

rates. This phenomenon is particularly critical among older age groups. Second, cardiovascular mortality of persons under 25 years of age is rare. Third, it is the middle age group that contributes largely to sex differentials in cardiovascular mortality (Moriyama et al., 1971).
Cardiovascular deaths for this study were defined as those classified according to the Ninth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (codes 390-429). To insure reliable death rates, deaths were averaged over an 11year period, from 1970 to 1980. Death rates were age-adjusted, using the direct method with the 1975 United States total population as the standard. As a measure of the sex mortality differential, the ratio of the male rate to the female rate was used.
- Level of urbanization was classified into three categories: large urban, small urban, and rural. Large urban counties were at least 75 per cent urban in 1970. Counties with between 50 and 75 per cent of the population urban in 1970 were small urban. Counties with less than 50per cent of the population urban were classified as rural. The annual rate of net migration during 1970-75 among individuals 25to 64years old was used to classify counties into two migration types: in-migration and out-migration counties.2
Using Chiang's (1961) method, we calculated standard errors of mortality rates to determine how confident one

can be that the rate for a particular county differs from the rate for the United States as a whole. If the confidence interval of a county does not overlap with that of the United States, the death rate of that area is statistically significant at the 95 per cent confidence level.
The size of the sex mortality ratio depends upon two components: male death rates and female death rates. For example, large ratios can result from abnormally low female mortality coupled with a relatively high death rate for males or may reflect higher male mortality compared to other populations having a similar level of female mortality. In order to differentiate these contributions, we applied a component analysis as follows (Lopez, 1983):
' MIF- M/F = (1/2) (M-M) (1/F+1/F) + (1/2) (M + M) ((F-F)/F*F)
where:
M is the male mortality of the given population,
Fis the female mortality of the given population,
M is the male mortality of the United States,
Fis the female mortality of the United States.

the male death rate is from 17.6 to 524.7, and that of the female is from 0 to 222.0.3 The range of the sex mortality ratio is from 0.26 to 19.00, with a mean sex mortality ratio of 3.5, that is, the male death rate is an average three and one-half times higher than the female rate in the United States as a whole. Only eight out of 3,075 counties (0.26 per cent) have sex mortality ratios less than I.4
The maps in Figures 1 and 2 present county tabulations of CVD mortality and are designed to help visualize geographic variation at the county level. The maps also serve to identify counties with high CVD death rates, which in turn may provide clues or hypotheses concerning the etiology of CVD.
Counties within the highest quartile of sex-specific death rates are presented in the shaded portions of the maps. The greatest concentrations of counties within the highest quartile of death rates for males are located largely in the southeast. The patterns for females are somewhat similar to those for males, with the highest quartile areas concentrated to an even greater extent in the southeastern United States. Although not presented in these maps, to a very

The first component on the right-hand side of the equation measures the contribution arising from differences in male mortality between the given population and the total United States population; and the second, the contribution due to differences in female mortality.

4The eight counties are as follows: McCone, MT; Arthur, NE: Eureka, NV; Crockett, TX; Kenedy, TX; King, TX; Sterling, TX; Terrell, TX. Since these counties have relatively small populations and/or deaths, wecalculated standardized Zscores to evaluate the reliability of the death rate. The range of male Z-scores is from --1.9 to -0.11 and that of female scores isfrom 0.01 to 0.61. Both male andfemale death rates arenot extreme cases. Male death rates in these counties are lower than the average male rate,while female death ratesare higher than the average female rate, leading to lower sex mortality ratios.

substantial degree, the areas in the second quartile are located near areas in the highest quartile. Death rates bysex clearly indicate that death rates for females tend to parallel those for males, but notperfectly. Thestrength of the association between male and female mortality is quite strong (r = 0.59).
The sexmortality ratio, the male rate divided by the female rate, provides a measure for describing both similarities and differences by sex in patterns of death rates. In Figure 3, the shaded portions of the map represent the counties with the highest quartile of ratios; that is, the rates for males are 3.7 times or more greater than the female rates. These areas are widely scattered, but a majority are located in the central part of the United States where male and/or female mortality levels are relatively low.

SEX DIFFERENTIALS BY LEVEL OF
URBANIZATION AND TYPE OF MIGRATION
Age-adjusted mortality rates were calculated by urbanization level. The range of male mortality is from 22.98 in small-urban counties to 243.88 in rural counties, while that of female mortality is from 70.12in small-urban counties to 79.60 inlarge-urban counties. Therange of the sexmortality ratio is from 2.95in large-urban counties to 3.15 in smallurban counties. The most interesting observation is that small-urban counties have the lowest mortality rates for both sexes accompanied by the highest sex mortality ratios.

counties have the highest mortality for males, while large-urban counties have the highest mortality for females. The mortality of small-urban counties is lower than the national average for both sexes. As for sex mortality ratios, largeurban counties have lower sex mortality ratios than the national average. All the differentials between the national average and the urbanization groups are statistically significant.

Age-adjusted mortality rates were calculated by migration type. The male mortality rate is 224.76 for in-migration counties and 242.76 for out-migration counties, while for females the rates are 70.56 and 83.03, respectively. The sex mortality ratio is 2.92 for out-migration counties and 3.19 for in-migration counties. In-migration counties exhibit higher sex mortality ratios than outmigration counties accompanied by

lower mortality rates for both sexes. The mortality of in-migration counties is lower, for both sexes, than that of the nation as a whole (4 per cent less for males, and 9 per cent less for females). The sex mortality ratio is 4 per cent below the national average in outmigration counties. All the differentials are statistically significant at the 95 per cent confidence level.
Age-adjusted mortality rates were calculated by level of urbanization and type of migration simultaneously. The range of male mortality is from 209.52 for large-urban in-migration counties to 254.59 for rural out-migration counties. The range of female mortality rates is from 66.38 for large-urban in-migration counties to 85.86 for large-urban outmigration counties. The range of the sex mortality ratio is from 2.88 for largeurban out-migration counties to 3.21 for rural in-migration counties. Although large-urban in-migration counties have the lowest mortality rates for both sexes, sex-specific mortality rates do not follow the same pattern among other county types. In other words, areas with the highest level of male mortality do not necessarily have the highest level of female mortality among other county types.
Standardized sex mortality differentials provide additional information concerning the relationship between male and female mortality (Table 1, lower panel). There is a clear urbanization-migration interaction effect on sex mortality differentials, and all the differentials between the nation and the county groups are statistically significant. For men, large-urban outmigration counties and all rural counties have higher mortality than the national average. For women, large-urban outmigration counties and rural out-

migration counties have higher rates than the national average. Counties having higher mortality for males also have higher mortality for females than the nation as a whole. However, for rural in-migration counties, the male rate is above the average, but the female rate is below the average.
As for sex mortality ratios, smallurban out-migration counties and all inmigration counties have higher ratios than the national average by more than 3 per cent. It should be emphasized again that counties with lower female mortality have higher sex mortality ratios regardless of male mortality.
DECOMPOSITION OF SEX MORTALITY
DIFFERENTIALS
Spatial variations of mortality by urbanization, migration, and urbanization and migration simultaneously consistently revealed that areas with high levels of female mortality have low levels of sex mortality ratios, while areas with low levels of female mortality have high levels of sex mortality ratios. In order to investigate the relationship between sex-specific mortality and the sex mortality ratio, we decomposed the differences between the sex mortality ratio for a given county group and that based on the national population in terms of male and female contribution (Table 2). A positively signed difference indicates that a given county group has a higher sex mortality ratio than the national average. A positively signed male or female component indicates that sexspecific mortality operates to increase the differential between men and women, while a negative sign signifies the opposite effect.
The differences in sex mortality ratios result from various combinations of male and female mortality. In rural in-

migration counties, both male and female mortality increase the sex mortality ratio. In rural out-migration counties and large-urban out-migration counties, male mortality increases the sex mortality ratio, but female mortality decreases it. On the other hand, in large-urban inmigration counties and all small-urban counties, male mortality decreases the sex mortality ratio, while female mortality increases it.
The effect of female mortality on the sex mortality ratio, whether negative or positive, far exceeds that of males for all county types by urbanization and migration. In other words, female mortality makes a greater contribution to the differential between the sex mortality ratio for a given county group and that of the national population. Taken together, whatever the combination of male and female mortality is, female mortality is the primary factor accounting for the size of sex mortality ratios. Indeed, the strength of association between male mortality and the sex mortality ratio at the county level is negligible (r = 0.02), while that of female mortality and the sex mortality ratio is strong (r = 0.62). That is, the higher the female mortality, the lower the sex mortality ratio.

AGE-SPECIFIC SEX MORTALITY
DIFFERENTIALS
The risk of dying increases markedly as one becomes older, and the increase is dramatic for males. For all age groups, the male death rate exceeds that of females, and the male excess in dying is much greater with increases in age regardless of county types (Figure 4). The age-specific sex mortality differentials by level of urbanization and type of migration generally indicate that the effect of urbanization and migration on agespecific mortality is not significant by sex; but, the differences among county groups increase with age. In general, for men, all rural counties and large-urban out-migration counties have higher rates than the national average. For women, large-urban out-migration counties and rural out-migration counties have higher rates than the national average. These age-specific patterns by urbanization and migration level are the same as those portrayed for ageadjusted rates.
Sex mortality ratios by level of urbanization and type of migration presented in Figure 5 gradually increase with age and then decrease after age 55 with a peak occurring at ages 45-54. We compared ratios for age-specific groups to see if the county group patterns are similar. For the middle-age group, the differences in sex mortality ratios among county types are the greatest: largeurban in-migration counties have the highest mortality ratio while largeurban out-migration counties have the lowest ratio. In general, small-urban out-migration counties and all inmigration counties have higher sex mortality ratios than the United States as a whole throughout all age groups. In contrast, rural out-migration counties and large-urban out-migration counties tend

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
In the United States, the male death rate from cardiovascular mortality is on average three and one-half times higher than the female rate. Counties with the highest death rates for both males and

females are located largely in the southeastern part of the United States. Counties with the highest sex mortality ratio are relatively scattered, but a major proportion is located in the central part of the United States.
When sex mortality differentials are investigated by level of urbanization and type of migration, some interesting patterns emerge. Large urban counties have the lowest sex mortality ratios along with the highest mortality rates for females and intermediate level rates for

males. In-migration counties exhibit higher sex mortality ratios than outmigration counties accompanied by the lowest mortality rates for both sexes. When level of urbanization and type of migration are considered together, the sex mortality ratio is lowest for largeurban out-migration counties and highest for rural in-migration counties, with levels of mortality varying for each sex group. That sex differentials are primarily a function of female mortality is confirmed by the decomposition of sex differentials into sex-specific mortality.
The results clearly demonstrate that sex mortality rates and differentials vary by community type. But, it should be remembered that all counties grouped by level of urbanization are composites of rural and urban populations. For example, rural counties are a composite of very diverse areas with urban population percentages ranging from zero to less than 50. This creates the potential for an "ecological fallacy." When small urban and rural counties are compared, it is possible that a difference in mortality between two county groups could be mistakenly attributed to the rural population when it is actually due to higher rates among the urban population in one county group than in the other. That is, one simply does not know whether it is persons in the rural or urban areas who have the highest mortality. Similarly, one does not know whether it is in-migrants who have the lowest risk of dying in one county group rather than in another. Further research will need to focus on the development of more refined classifications of urbanization and migration.
Residence and migration per se may not cause high or low sex-specific mor-

tality and sex mortality ratios. The variables subsume a large set of more directly causal biological and behavioral factors or the interaction of them. For instance, males' excessive deaths across all age groups lends support to the idea that females may be protected from CVD by estrogen hormones. However, the similar spatial clusterings of male and female mortality also suggest the importance of external conditions. It also points to an instance where biological differences between the sexes play a mediating role between environmental factors and mortality. Because of the prophylactic effects of estrogens, any environmental changes such as stress levels, diet, etc., which accelerate atherosclerosis will work to the relative disadvantage of males. In any case, the specific relationships require further development, since current knowledge provides a limited theoretical basis for explaining the observed variations.
The task completed in the first phase of this research is a description of the extent and nature of sex differentials in mortality. The next step is to identify factors responsible for sex differentials in mortality. If the factors responsible for the experience of the areas with high and low deaths can be identified, then the application of this knowledge may be used to reduce deaths and lower sex mortality rates.
