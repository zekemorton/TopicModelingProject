ABSTRACT: Genetic counseling, second trimester amniocentesis, reliable techniques for analyzing fetal amniotic fluid and selective abortion together have the potential to prevent a variety of serious birth defects. Advances in technique and/or changing patterns of childbearing may place a large number of women in age groups where genetic counseling programs are recommended. However, attitudes toward abortion may be a critical variable in ascertaining the potential of genetic counseling programs to reduce birth defects. If opposition to abortion is based on a moral commitment, greater awareness of genetic counseling programs will lead to opposition to these programs. If attitudes toward abortion are based upon an evaluative process, such opposition is less likely to occur. Using a sample of women from the Rochester, New York, area (N = 1,616) whose attitudes toward abortion match U.S. estimates, we find that the greater the knowledge about prenatal screening, the less prevalent are attitudes opposed to abortion in circumstances necessary for birth defect reduction. This relationship holds when controlled for religion and family size. We conclude that educational and counseling programs concerning the potential benefits of prenatal screening are unlikely to arouse opposition to these programs.

Genetic counseling, coupled with second trimester amniocentesis and reliable techniques for analyzing fetal amniotic fluid, have resulted in unprecedented possibilities for prenatal detection and prevention of a variety of serious birth defects. Studies have been published documenting safety and reliability, defining specific indications (NICHD, 1976; Simpson et al., 1976), and detailing technical results of chromosomal and biochemical analyses of cultured fetal cells and amniotic fluid (Milunsky, 19756, 1976; Nadler, 1976) as well as cost-benefit analyses (Hagard and Carter, 1976; Conley and Milunsky, 1975). However, there is a lack of information concerning factors which influence acceptability of these procedures by expectant couples.

In this paper we report findings concerning how attitudes toward abortion, knowledge of possibilities for prenatal screening, and certain other factors influence acceptance of prenatal diagnostic procedures. Our analysis supports the conclusion that educational and counseling approaches concerning the benefits, availability, and applicability of prenatal diagnosis may facilitate wider use of prenatal screening as a means of reducing the prevalence of some types of serious birth defects.

greater than past usage would indicate.

Important reasons for delay .in widespread use of these techniques included lack of awareness by both physicians and patients, and perhaps more importantly, lack of information concerning potential fetal and maternal risks of the diagnostic procedures (Milunsky, 19756). Risk associated with the amniocentesis procedure is an important consideration in the decision to recommend amniocentesis since the frequencies of many detectable abnormalities associated with advancing maternal age are generally low.
The results of two recent national stud-

Two separate considerations suggest that the numbers of women who could benefit from prenatal screening will increase, perhaps substantially, in future years. First, safety of the diagnostic procedures may improve significantly. For example, one line of current research is exploiting the knowledge that small numbers of fetal blood cells cross the placenta during early pregnancy and enter the mother's circulatory system (Shroder and Herzenberg, 1977; Doherty and Horan, 1978). If procedures can be developed to isolate and analyze these fetal cells from a

sample of the pregnant woman's blood, the safety of the diagnostic procedure will become comparable to that of a simple blood test. A negligible risk associated with the prenatal screening procedure itself would promote the possibility that the majority of pregnant women in the future might choose to have prenatal screening.
Demographic factors suggest a second manner in which the numbers of women who could benefit from prenatal screening may increase. Although period fertility rates in the United States are currently extremely low among all age groups of women (National Center for Health Statistics, 1977, pp. 1-9), two factors suggest that future births to women over 30 years of age may become more numerous. First, the number of women in the age group 30-40 years will increase during the next decade, representing the delayed impact of the "baby boom" of the 1940's and 19S0's. Second, the figure for average lifetime births expected for all women, both married and nonmarried, is still more than two children per woman (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1977, p. 9). Thus, although period married fertility is below the level of population replacement, if substantial numbers of women in the age group 20-30 years fulfill their stated birth expectations, childbearing among women over 30 is likely to be greater in the near future than it has been during the preceding decade. Therefore, potential increases in demand for prenatal screening are likely to occur, both due to a probable increase in the safety of the technique and due to a likely increase in childbearing among older women with a higher risk for certain detectable fetal birth defects.
However, the effects of increased diffusion of knowledge about the circumstances in which prenatal diagnosis is medically acceptable, coupled with an increase in the number of pregnant women in these categories, might not increase the frequen-

cies of detected birth defects. Although a major benefit of prenatal diagnosis is parental reassurance concerning the absence of serious fetal abnormality, counseling concerning the potential uses of prenatal diagnosis is often coupled with the realization that prenatal screening can prevent birth defects only if used in conjunction with elective abortion. Since potential public health benefits of prenatal screening as a preventive health approach derive from decreased expenditures for support of severely incapacitated individuals, the proportion of women at risk who decide not to abort abnormal fetuses is an important parameter for estimating the overall impact of prenatal screening on reduction of certain types of detectable birth defects in the population at large. Acceptance of prenatal screening is therefore intertwined with attitudes toward elective abortion and the circumstances under which couples are willing to abort a fetus diagnosed as abnormal. In particular, new low risk procedures may not substantially increase the number of prenatal screenings if substantial numbers of women are opposed to any procedures where benefits are in part derived through the abortion of the abnormal fetuses.
ATTITUDES TOWARD ABORTION
As stated by Tietze and Lewit (1977, p. 21), "Over the past 10years in many countries abortion has changed from a largely disreputable practice into an accepted medical one, from a subject of gossip into an openly debated public issue." Responses to attitudinal surveys conducted during this period suggest that attitudes toward abortion have changed toward approval of legal abortion for a greater number of reasons. Of direct concern to prenatal screening programs is the percentage of persons believing legal abortions should be available to women with a

strong probability of giving birth to a deformed or defective child. Although question wording and coding vary somewhat, making the results not strictly comparable, in the early 196O's about 70 per cent of American adults approved of legal abortions for this reason (Blake, 1971, p. 541), while in 1975 80 per cent approved (Arney and Trescher, 1976).
Not surprisingly, attitudes toward abortion differ when characteristics such as education and religion are considered. Catholics, persons with relatively less education, nonwhites, and persons from rural areas tend to approve of abortion less often than do Protestants, the more educated, whites, and persons from urban/ suburban areas (Arney and Trescher, 1976). Attitudes toward abortion by age have changed since the early 1960's. Initially, surveys found that older persons were less likely to disapprove of abortion than were younger persons. Arney and Trescher (1976, p. 121) report that after 1972 younger age groups are more favorable toward abortion than older groups, reflecting a change toward the more widespread approval of abortion in a greater number of circumstances among younger groups.
In summary, in 1975 about 80 per cent of American adults approved of legal abortion if a fetus had been diagnosed as defective. Less certain, however, is how these attitudes would relate to behavior in a prenatal screening program.1 On one hand, opposition to abortion may decrease significantly when a woman is presented with the likely consequences of having to care for a seriously defective baby. This
1 The relationship between attitudes toward abortion and incidence of elective abortion is little studied. Swigar et al. (1977) report on a group of women who had applied for an induced hospital abortion. Women from this group who later gave birth were compared with those aborting. The major significant differences indicated that dropouts and their partners were somewhat less educated than were women who eventually had an abortion.

reasoning suggests that attitudes toward abortions would underestimate the number of women for whom prenatal screening would be utilized. On the other hand, survey questions on attitudes toward abortion have concentrated on attitudes toward availability of legal abortions. It is possible that attitudinal opposition to legal abortion may overestimate the number of women who would consider an abortion for themselves. Approval of the legal availability of abortion may not mean that a particular woman or couple would consider an abortion appropriate in the specified circumstances.
To orient subsequent discussion and analysis, we will hypothesize that individual opposition to abortion may be the result of two somewhat different modes of orientation to the issues involved. Opposition may be the result of a direct ideological and/or religious commitment to oppose abortion on the grounds that it is an inherently immoral act. Opposition to abortion for this reason would also suggest opposition to prenatal screening. However, opposition may also result from more or less reasoned judgment concerning perceived costs, benefits, responsibilities, and alternatives in a given situation.2 This latter interpretation of the origins of opposition to abortion is suggested by the several surveys which indicate that less than 10 per cent of adults are opposed to abortion under all circumstances presented to respondents (Arney and Trescher, 1976, p. 118).3
It is desirable to know how considerations of the existence and uses of
2 For an excellent in-depth study of how abortion is placed within the context of a woman's overall reproductive behavior, see Luker (1975).
3 Our categorization of opposition to abortion in terms of a consideration of absolute values or in terms of a more situationally determined decision process is essentially the same as Max Weber's wellknown distinction between Wertrationalitat and Zweckrationalitat (Weber, 1947, p. 115; Parsons, 1937, pp. 640ff).

prenatal screening for fetal abnormalities relate to attitudes toward abortion and furthermore whether those relationships appear to be based on a moral commitment or a judgmental evaluative process. Attitudes concerning the availability of legal abortions have been shown to vary according to the circumstances surrounding conception and/or the contemplated abortion, but widespread awareness of the potentialities of prenatal screening has not been one of the circumstances evaluated in previous research. Information concerning the relationship between knowledge of prenatal screening possibilities and attitudes toward abortion under circumstances of probable fetal abnormality is required as part of the overall estimation of the potential benefits of prenatal screening in more widespread programs aimed at the reduction of birth defects.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
THE DATA SAMPLE
The data used to investigate the relationships discussed above are based on responses to questionnaires completed during the spring of 1977 by 1,616 women aged 30 to 45 residing in Monroe County (Rochester, New York) and five nearby counties. The sample is not random. However, it was drawn in a systematic fashion and departures from randomness are known. Most importantly, crucial tabulations are comparable to tabulations using samples representative of the United States adult population, leading us to believe that, in spite of deviations from randomness, our data are representative.
In the Rochester area, Blue Cross conducts a periodic sample survey of its subscribers in order to estimate coverage and other pertinent data. Blue Cross estimates that coverage is 80 per cent of the population under 65 years old. A 3 per cent sample of family contract subscribers

was surveyed in 1976. If women aged 30 to 45 were reported as covered, a questionnaire was mailed to them to obtain information concerning their knowledge of prenatal screening and attitudes toward abortion. After two mailings and a telephone contact, questionnaires were obtained from 73.5 per cent {N = 1,616) of these women. The original Blue Cross survey had a response rate of 90 per cent, resulting in an overall response rate of 66 per cent (0.900 X 0.735).
Obvious concern about the impact of a sample which represents only about twothirds of the target population has led to detailed evaluation of probable biases (Roghmann, 1978). Response rates were higher (1) among the youngest and oldest age groups of women (i.e., women aged 30 or 31 and 44 or 45), (2) among residents of the higher socioeconomic status neighborhoods, and (3) if women were spouses of subscribers rather than the subscribers themselves. No bias was found in response rates by family size or the number of previous hospitalizations.
However, our main justification for believing the sample is nonetheless representative results from the level of agreement between certain tabulations made with these data and published results from representative samples of the U.S. adult population. This information is presented in the Results section of this paper (Table 1).
ATTITUDE MEASUREMENT
Attitudes toward abortion were obtained by "yes" or "no" responses to a question asking: "Do you think a pregnant woman should be able to obtain a legal abortion under any of the following circumstances?" The circumstances listed are those used in previous research measuring attitudes toward abortion (e.g., "If there is a strong chance of serious defect in the baby") (see Arney and Trescher, 1976, p.

Two different scales were constructed to measure knowledge of prenatal screening for fetal abnormalities. The first scale measures the level of knowledge about the categories of people who should consider prenatal screening in the sense that the physical risks of amniocentesis are less than potential benefits. The second measures knowledge about which abnormalities are generally recognized by medical professionals as detectable by these screening procedures.

construction purposes, and the sum of correct responses to these items plus the question concerning the availability of the diagnostic procedure itself were used to form a scale of the knowledge of abnormalities detectable by the screening procedures. Again, a set of categories was formed by grouping women with 0 to 2 correct as "low" knowledge, 3 to 5 as "moderate" knowledge, and 6through 12 as "high" level of knowledge about detectable fetal abnormalities.

The initial question on the questionnaire asked: "Most babies are born healthy, but a few may have birth defects (congenital malformations or abnormalities seen soon after birth). Do you know whether there is now a medical test available to tell beforea baby is born (prenatal diagnosis) if it will have a birth defect?" Responses of "yes," "no," and "don't know" were allowed. The next question asked "In your view, who should have

5 An objection could be raised that these women are unaware of the appropriateness 6f prenatal diagnosis because they plan no more pregnancies and hence this knowledge is not salient to them. Not surprising for women between 30 and 45, 88 per cent planned no more pregnancies. However, the relationship between future pregnancy plans, categorized as "do not plan more or don't know" and "plan more children," and the knowledge scale was not statistically significant.

In Table 5 attitudes toward abortion have been cross-tabulated with knowledge of detectable characteristics. The relationship is the same as that noted in Table 4, although not nearly as strong. It should be remembered that most women could not correctly identify detectable fetal abnor-

malities, and, as such, it islikely thatthe knowledge scale presented in Table 5 weakly discriminates among levels of knowledge. In other words, the level of ignorance is high throughout andchance variations among response patterns had a marked impact on the categorization. With this consideration, the relationship in Table 5confirms the findings presented in Table 4, but at the same time suggests that knowledge of who should have prenatal diagnosis is a more useful scale.6

We have previously suggested that ona general level, opposition to abortion may be characterized as theresult of either a moral commitment or the result of reasoned judgment. Among our sample as with previous sample surveys, Catholic women have been shown to be more opposed to abortion than were Protestant women. Given the position of Catholic doctrine, the relationship would appearas a prima facie indication of an ideological relationship between religion and opposition to abortion.

However, data presented in Table 6 documents that this is not completely the case. In Table 6, the relationship between attitudes toward abortion and knowledge concerning who should have prenatal diagnosis has been controlled for religion. If religion were the sole determinant of attitudes toward abortion, the relationship between attitudes toward abortion and knowledge would have disappeared (Davis, 1971, p. 82). However, based upon both inspection of the tables and the summary statistics, the relationship is the same among all women and among both Catholics and Protestants. That is, both among Protestants and Catholics increasing knowledge of prenatal diagnosis is related to decreasing opposition to abortion. To be sure, Catholics are still more likely to be opposed to abortion, but these data indicate that differences in knowledge have similar impact upon attitudes toward abortion regardless of religion.

Further analyses were performed to substantiate the findings in Table 6. First the relationship between attitudes toward abortion and knowledge was controlled for family size (data not shown).7 The relationship was maintained in all three family size categories with contingency coefficients of 0.23, 0.17, and 0.17 for small, moderate, and large families, respectively. Again, knowledge influences attitudes independent of family size.
Second, the relationship between attitudes toward abortion and knowledge of who should have prenatal diagnosis was simultaneously controlled for both religion and family size. A summary of these results is presented in Table 7. The rows in Table 7 represent the "opposed" row of the 6 cross-tabulations between attitudes toward abortion and knowledge of who
7 Family-size categories were small (0-1 child), medium (2 or 3 children), and large (4 or more children).
