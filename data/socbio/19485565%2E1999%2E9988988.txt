ABSTRACT: Data for a sample of 89 countries are used to examine societal-level predictors of the legal status of abortion and its incidence as indicated by abortion rates. Measures of socioeconomic development, women's labor force participation, and dominant religion are considered as predictors of abortion. Logistic regression analysis reveals that socioeconomic development has a positive effect on the probability of abortion being legal. Both a greater dominance of Catholicism and Islam in a society reduce the probability that abortion is legal. Results of tobit analyses show that development has curvilinear effects on abortion rates, with lower rates of abortion at both the lower and higher ends of development. Findings also indicate a positive effect of female labor force participation on the abortion rate that initially grows stronger with increases in socioeconomic development, but weakens with further increases. Finally, a greater proportion of Catholics in a population lowers the abortion rate.

The social and demographic characteristics of women who undergo abortion are well documented for the United States population (e.g., Henshaw et al., 1991; Kochanek, 1991; Koonin et al., 1995; Powell-Griner and Trent, 1987; Trent and Powell-Griner, 1991) and for many other national populations (for a few of many examples see Baker and Khasiani, 1992; Filicori and Flamigni, 1981; Li et al., 1990; Popov, 1991; Skjeldestad and Borgan, 1994). These studies examine abortion and its determinants within particular populations. Several very rich descriptive studies compare societies and report considerable crossnational variation in the incidence of abortion (e.g., David, 1983; Henshaw, 1990a, \990b; Jones et al., 1986; Rolston and Eggert, 1994; Tietze, 1981; Tietze and Henshaw, 1986). Other studies focus on national variation in abortion law

(e.g., Wasserman, 1983; United Nations, 1992, 1993, 1995). Multivariate analyses of cross-societal variation in abortion are noticeably underrepresented in this literature.
A more thorough understanding of abortion differentials across national populations is important for medical, demographic, and public health reasons. For example, from a medical standpoint, in many countries abortion is one of the most frequently performed surgical procedures (David, 1992). Abortion is also one of the oldest and most widely used methods of fertility control and is practiced today throughout the world, from very remote rural to very large urban populations (David, 1983; United Nations, 1992). Demographically, induced abortion is clearly one of the proximate determinants of fertility (Bongaarts and Potter, 1983; Davis and Blake, 1956) and

has played, and continues to play, an important role in the maintenance or decline of fertility levels in national populations (David, 1983; Foreit, 1982; Frejka, 1983, 1985a). As Frejka (1983, 1985a) reports, the effect of abortion on fertility is often substantial, although less than the effect of contraception. Importantly, from a public health concern, induced abortion is also a major cause of maternal mortality in lesser-developed societies (Baretto et al., 1992; David, 1983; Dixon-Mueller, 1990).
The purpose of this paper is to analyze the structural determinants of abortion in national populations. We use available abortion data for a sample of 89 countries to examine the net effects of socioeconomic development, women's labor force participation, and dominant religion on both the legality and incidence of abortion. We are interested in the determinants of both policies regarding abortion and the incidence of abortion. Although the social and demographic context likely affect both, those factors that influence the legality of abortion may differ from those that influence its frequency. For example, variation in the incidence of abortion is not solely due to differences in national abortion laws. Some observers note that permissive abortion laws do not invariably lead to a high incidence of abortion in those countries which lack restrictions (United Nations, 1992). No study, to our knowledge, examines both the legality and incidence of abortion across societies both using a large sample and systematically explaining that variation within a multivariate analytic framework. In fact, the extant literature on crosssocietal variation in abortion is largely descriptive. Theoretically, there is strong justification to expect complex relationships between various national social in-

dicators and abortion. However, no study has empirically examined these expected relationships.
THEORY
This study focuses on the societal context in which abortion occurs. General theories of fertility behavior, and theoretical arguments and descriptive studies of abortion, point to three particular structural aspects of societies that may be salient for explaining national abortion patterns: 1) socioeconomic development, 2) women's status and female labor force participation, and 3) religion.
SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND
ABORTION
The level of modernization or economic development of nations that correlate with higher standards of living is central to explanations of national demographic variation and population change. Although there are certainly varied patterns of fertility response to structural and cultural change (Hirschman, 1994; McNicoll, 1992; Szreter, 1993), socioeconomic development and fertility have been repeatedly linked in demographic research; and measures of modernization are correlated with other aspects of family formation behavior as well (Mauldin and Berelson, 1978; Tolnay and Rodheaver, 1988; South and Trent, 1988, as a few of many examples). The nature of these relationships has attracted much research because of its relevance to demographic transition theory. There are several reasons to expect that socioeconomic development will also affect the legality of abortion and its incidence across societies.
Low levels of development might be expected to coincide with the legalization

of, and liberal stance toward, abortion because of the state's desire to slow rapid population growth. Such conditions as low levels of social and economic development and rapid population growth have led to the adoption of many national family planning programs. However, such motivations to curb population growth via adoption of nonrestrictive abortion policies actually have occurred in only a few countries; the majority of countries with liberal abortion laws are more developed countries with low birth rates (Tietze, 1981). Perhaps more important to understanding variation in abortion law is that the modernization process inherent in social and economic development entails ideological and other value changes (Kerckoff, 1972). To the extent that modernity is reflected in more liberal legal codes, we should expect laws favoring abortion more likely in more developed rather than less developed countries.
The incidence of abortion should also vary by level of socioeconomic development. As demographic transition theory suggests, the modernization process can affect fertility through numerous processes as social, cultural, and economic change motivate persons to have fewer children. Modernization entails a variety of transformations which alter the social and economic value of children; among many other factors, mass education and media disperse values of small family size (Caldwell, 1980). Moreover, improved standards of living ensure more children survive and fewer births are needed to sustain desired family size (Caldwell et al., 1992; Heer, 1966, 1983). Thus, a prevailing argument is that children become more a financial liability and less a social and economic asset (Bulatao, 1982; Caldwell, 1976, 1982; among

others). To the extent that expanded socioeconomic development lowers the overall demand for children, we should expect increases in the level of abortion since voluntary termination serves as a direct resolution for unwanted pregnancies and a means for maintaining desired family size.
Social and economic development should also be related to the availability of abortion services, which, in turn, influence abortion rates. Economic development and urbanization are strongly related (Firebaugh, 1979; London, 1987, 1988); and abortion services are concentrated in large urban areas in many countries (Jones et al., 1986). Women in less urban countries may simply not have the resources or services available to them should they choose to terminate a pregnancy.
Paradoxically, since social and economic development are also related to greater availability and efficient use of contraception, development should also lower the demand for abortion by lowering unwanted pregnancy rates (Jones et al., 1986). Therefore, the relationship between abortion and socioeconomic development may well be curvilinear. At very low levels of development, abortion should be low because of the high demand and greater social and economic value placed on children (Bulatao, 1982; Caldwell, 1976, 1982; Ward, 1984). As levels of development increase, abortion rates should rise in concert with social and economic pressures to limit family size. At some threshold further increases in development may be associated with a leveling off or decline in abortion rates, as efficient contraceptive behavior becomes more universal.
Indeed, several authors note that abortion is quite prevalent as women become

motivated to reduce their fertility but have yet to adopt, or have available, efficient contraceptive technology (David, 1983; Foreit and Nortman, 1992; Popov, 1991). Women are less likely to use induced abortion when they are efficient contraceptors (David, 1983; Foreit and Nortman, 1992; Foreit, 1982). Although there are exceptions, countries with low fertility and high use of effective contraceptive methods have moderate to low rates of induced abortion (Frejka, 1985ft). Henshaw (1990a, p. 88) argues that as fertility declines abortion becomes more common as does contraceptive use. However, at some point "contraceptive use becomes sufficiently widespread to cause the abortion rate to fall, but many developing countries have yet to reach this point." Modernization, the desire to limit family size, contraceptive use, and the changing nature of abortion usage are inextricably related, and much research examines the relationships among most of these variables. However, to our knowledge, the hypothesized curvilinear relationship between modernization and abortion alluded to in some studies has not been empirically verified in a crosssocietal analysis.
WOMEN'S STATUS, FEMALE LABOR
FORCE PARTICIPATION, AND ABORTION
The enhanced status of women likely fosters a sociocultural environment in which abortion is legal and more readily accessible. In most societies issues of women's equality, reproductive freedom, and access to safe and legal abortion are closely intertwined philosophically and politically (Luker, 1984). Therefore, national indicators of women's status and the legality of abortion should be correlated. In nations where women have

greater status, more social, political, and economic autonomy, abortion laws are likely not as restrictive as in societies in which women's lives are more socially constrained.
Women's status is also related to fertility behavior. Improvements in women's status loosen women's reliance on men for status and translate into potential additional roles to those traditional ones as wives and mothers. Fertility declines as women's opportunities expand and they begin to adopt and pursue these other roles (Oppong, 1983). Again, the incidence of abortion should be higher as the social and economic costs of children increase.
Women's status is most often conceptualized in terms of economic power and access to and control of resources (Mason, 1984). For example, women's rate of labor force participation is a very strong predictor of women's political status (Oakes and Almquist, 1993). Therefore, we might expect women's rate of participation in the labor force to be correlated with the legal status of abortion throughout the world.
Female labor force participation is also related to fertility behavior. Research on the relationship between female labor force participation and fertility has been of long-standing interest to social demographers (see review by Lehrer and Nerlove, 1986). A negative relationship between female labor force participation and fertility has been found in studies in both industrialized and developing nations, although that relationship tends to be weaker or nonexistent in less developed countries (Cramer, 1980; Gurak and Kritz, 1982; Kasarda, 1971; Lehrer and Nerlove, 1986; Mason, 1984; Standing, 1983). More specific to abortion behavior, a positive effect

of female labor force participation on abortion rates holds at the aggregate level in the United States (Borders and Cutright, 1979). In general, then, we expect the level of women's labor force participation to be positively correlated with the abortion rate.
THE INTERACTION BETWEEN
SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND
WOMEN'S LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION
Importantly, the effect of female labor force participation on the abortion rate may vary by level of socioeconomic development. The effect of female labor force participation on fertility is dependent on the type of work women do (Lehrer and Nerlove, 1986; Mason, 1984; Standing, 1978, 1983). The often inconsistent findings reported for the relationship between female labor force participation and fertility in cross-national studies is thought to be due to the greater extent of work activities in developing countries that do not interfere with the bearing and caring of children. Several authors suggest that the nature of women's paid work in less developed countries is more compatible with childbearing than women's work in more developed societies (Gurak and Kritz, 1982; Lehrer and Nerlove, 1986; Pampel and Tanaka, 1986; Stycos and Weller, 1967; Tilly and Scott, 1978; Ward, 1984). Paid employment located in the home (such as weaving or sewing labor) or elsewhere where children may be taken along (such as for some types of agricultural work) allows women to more easily combine the roles of mother and worker (Stycos and Weller, 1967; Standing, 1983). Put more simply, in less developed countries children may pose less of a constraint on women's employment than in more de-

veloped societies (Standing, 1978). Therefore, the effect of female labor force participation on abortion is likely significantly stronger in more developed nations where the type of work women do creates more conflict between the roles of mother and paid worker. Working women in more developed countries may find unwanted pregnancies entail comparatively greater costs and may therefore be more likely to terminate a pregnancy.
RELIGION AND ABORTION
Much has been written on the relationships among religious ideology and culture, state policy, and social behavior (e.g., Billings, 1990; Burns, 1990; Kulczycki, 1995; Luker, 1984; Misra and Hicks, 1994). Religious codes and law influence secular law and behavior regarding abortion (United Nations, 1992). Religious law can affect behavior even in societies where such laws are not part of secular law or not enforced by the given legal system (United Nations, 1992). Therefore, the predominance of certain religions likely plays an important role in whether or not abortion is legal in a given society and its incidence rate.
The Roman Catholic church strongly opposes abortion (Kulczycki, 1995; Luker, 1984; Staggenborg, 1989; Tietze, 1981, among others). Such opposition may affect both the availability and use of abortion within societies. We expect nations with large Catholic populations are less likely to legalize abortion. We also expect abortion rates will be lower in countries with larger Catholic populations. Although Catholics might not differ from the general population in their abortion behavior as is currently reported for the United States (see Henshaw and Kost, 1996), the per cent Catholic does signifi-

cantly lower aggregate abortion rates as observed for metropolitan-level abortion rates in the U.S. (see Borders and Cutright, 1979). Therefore, we suspect that the relative proportion of Catholics in countries will influence abortion outcomes.
Laws legalizing abortion should also be less common in predominantly Moslem countries; and abortion rates should be lower than average in countries with large Moslem populations. Islamic law forbids the killing of the soul, but there are various interpretations as to when the fetus acquires a soul (Obermeyer, 1992; United Nations, 1992). Some Islamic law forbids abortion prior to quickening (when the fetus acquires a soul), and some permits abortion prior to quickening with justifiable grounds (United Nations, 1992). Some Islamic doctrines are less opposed to abortion, and abortion laws are more relaxed in the more modern Islamic countries (Henshaw, 1986). However, as Henshaw (1986, p. 250) as well as others have noted, in "the more strongly fundamentalist Islamic nations" there is very limited or no access to abortion services.
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT AND
HYPOTHESES
Previous descriptive studies of abortion, and theoretical and empirical research on fertility behavior, point to three major influences on the legal status and rate of abortion across societies. In this analysis, we build upon and extend other studies by simultaneously examining the effects of socioeconomic development, women's labor force participation, and religion on abortion. More specifically, we have the following objectives. First, we examine the net effects of socioeco-

nomic development, women's labor force participation, and the dominance of Catholicism and Islam in countries on the national legal status of abortion. Second, we examine the net effects of socioeconomic development, women's labor force participation, and the dominance of Catholicism and Islam in national populations on abortion rates. Third, we examine whether socioeconomic development has curvilinear effects on the abortion rate, and whether there is an interaction effect between socioeconomic development and women's labor force participation on the abortion rate.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The units of analysis for this study are 89 countries for which the requisite data on the independent and dependent variables could be obtained. (The countries used in the analysis are listed in Table 1.) The data are all from the circa-1980 time period. The sample includes both less and more developed countries. The sample captures 44 per cent of less developed and 85 per cent of more developed countries as defined by the Population Reference Bureau (Population Reference Bureau, 1983). Not surprising, given cross-national variation in data availability, the composition of our sample is tilted toward more developed nations. A comparison of our sample with a more complete listing of countries (Population Reference Bureau, 1983) shows our sample to have a similar mean life expectancy (62 years in the more complete Population Reference Bureau sample versus 61 years in our sample), a lower mean infant mortality rate (84 versus 68 in our sample), and a higher average level of urbanization (39 per cent versus 49 per cent in

our sample). The principal reason for
these differences is that only the more de-
veloped of "Third World" nations have
extensive and detailed national data avail-
able. Our sample is nonetheless large and
representative of nations from all major
regions of the world. Indeed, the sample
includes 25 African and 10 Middle East-
ern nations. Countries from African and
Middle Eastern regions of the world are
typically underrepresented in cross-soci-
etal analyses.
Two dependent variables are used be-
cause we are interested in both the legal
status of abortion and the extent to which
women obtain abortions. The first is a di-
chotomous variable indicating whether
abortion is legal or not (1 = legal, 0 = not legal).1 Abortion is legal in 37 per cent of
the countries in the sample. The second,
1Determining at what point abortion may be deemed legal in a society is often not clear-cut. For example, in countries where abortion is illegal, "abortion to save a woman's life may be authorized under general principles of criminal law (stats of necessity)" (Tietze, 1981, p. 17). In other countries, abortion is legal, but only for medical grounds that are narrowly defined, usually to save the life of the mother (Tietze, 1981). Since neither type of society represented in our sample provides data on the number of abortions, and abortion in both types of countries is likely rare, both types are defined in this analysis as "not legal" and are censored in the subsequent tobit analysis. In Mexico, Brazil, and Ecuador abortion is only legal to save the life of the mother and only for judicial reasons in the case of rape or incest (Tietze, 1981). In El Salvador, Malaysia, and Turkey, abortion is legal only for the above reasons and for eugenic (fetal) grounds and generally only permitted prior to the viability of the fetus (Tietze, 1981). Abortion data are not available for these six countries, and they have also been classified in this analysis as "not legal" cases and are censored in the tobit analysis. In all other countries categorized as "legal" for this analysis, abortion is legal without specified grounds (on demand) or for social, social-medical, and other grounds (Tietze, 1981). The classification used in this study is unlikely to affect the tobit analysis because countries where abortion is illegal without registered counts, or legal and rare without official counts, or legal and rare with very low registered counts will be weighted quite similarly in the tobit analysis.

the General Abortion Rate (GAR) is defined as the number of legal abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age (ages 15-44) (Tietze 1981). The General Abortion Rate is preferable to a Crude Abortion Rate (the number of abortions per 1,000 population) because it is less affected by the age and sex structure of a population.2 Among countries in which abortion is legal (i.e., that have non-zero GARs), the General Abortion Rate in our sample varies from a low of 0.1 in Botswana and South Africa to a high of 181.0 in the USSR (see Table 1). All data on the legal status and incidence of abortion used in this study are taken from Tietze (1981), Tietze and Henshaw (1986) and, in a few cases, the United Nations Demographic Yearbook (United Nations, 1982).
We should note that the abortion rate, one of the dependent variables in this study, is difficult to measure. The actual number of abortions performed throughout the world in a given year is unknown (David, 1983). In many countries abortion is illegal, but abortions nonetheless occur. Obviously, "research is most representative, valid, and reliable in countries where abortion is legal" and registered (David, 1983, p. 196). Therefore, our measure of abortion rates is based on legally obtained abortions. Importantly, the empirical analysis of the determinants of the abortion rate using tobit models (described below) takes into account cases where abortion is not legal.
2Alternative measures of abortion are, nonetheless, highly correlated with the General Abortion Rate. The General Abortion Rate and the Crude Abortion Rate are nearly perfectly correlated (r = 0.999, N = 33). The General Abortion Rate and the Abortion Ratio (per 1,000 live births) are also highly correlated (r = 0.98, N = 32). And the General Abortion Rate and another Abortion Ratio (per 1,000 known pregnancies) are also highly correlated (r = 0.89, N = 32).

Four independent variables are included in the models predicting the legal status of abortion and the abortion rate. The first independent variable considered is a measure of each nation's level of so-

cioeconomic development. We performed an exploratory factor analysis of three common development indicators--the infant mortality rate, life expectancy at birth, and the per cent of the population

70

that is urban (Population Reference Bureau, 1983). All three variables loaded highly on a single factor. These variables were transformed into standard scores and summed to give an index of socioeconomic development. The reliability of this index, as measured by Cronbach's alpha is high (alpha = 0.94). The socioeconomic development index ranges from a minimum of 0.1 in Upper Volta to a maximum of 10.1 in Hong Kong with a mean of6.0.3
The second independent variable is women's labor force participation measured as the percentage of adult women defined as economically active by the International Labour Office (Population Reference Bureau, 1981).4 Although the conceptual and methodological difficulties in measuring women's labor force participation are often noted (Dixon, 1982; Durand, 1974; Mason, 1986), this particular measure is frequently used in cross-national studies (e.g., South and Trent, 1988) and correlates highly with alternative operationalizations (Pampel and Tanaka, 1986). In this sample, the female labor force participation rate has a mean of 40.8 per cent and ranges from a low of 4 per cent in both Mauritania and Iraq to a high of 86 per cent in Rwanda.
3A constant of " 6 " was added to scores on the socioeconomic development index so that all scores would be positive and make the subsequent analysis and presentation of results more straightforward.
4The International Labour Office (1977) includes "among the economically active population or labour force all persons who contribute to the supply of labour for the production of economic goods and services, i.e., all employed persons (employers, persons working on their own account, salaried employees, wage earners, unpaid family workers, members of producer co-operatives and armed forces) and all the unemployed (both those with previous job experience and those seeking work for the first time)."

The final two independent variables capture the dominance of Catholicism and Islam in national populations. The first variable estimates the percentage of the population identified as Roman Catholic (Kurian, 1979). The per cent Catholic in our sample ranges from a low of 0 per cent (less than 1 per cent) in Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Iran, Pakistan, Japan, Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Bulgaria, to a high of over 95 per cent in the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Malta, and Spain, with a mean of 32.5 per cent. The second variable is a dummy variable representing predominantly Moslem nations (Maudlin and Berelson, 1978; Kurian, 1979). Twenty-two countries in our sample are identified as predominantly Moslem.5
The analysis proceeds by first presenting descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations for the variables used in the analysis. We then use logistic regression to analyze the effects of the independent variables on the dichotomous variable measuring the legal status of abortion. Tobit analysis is then used to analyze the effects of the independent variables on the abortion rate.
Tobit analysis is an appropriate statistical method for analyzing data with censored dependent variables (Roncek, 1992). A tobit model is the most appropriate method of analysis for predicting abortion rates since we have a classic sit-

We should also note that the dominance of Islam in a society is measured as a dummy variable and not as a percentage of the population (as we measure the dominance of Catholicism) because our major source of data provides the information in this manner.

uation in which there is a censored dependent variable--abortions are observed for cases where abortion is legal and abortions are not observed for cases where abortion is not legal. Actual values of abortion rates are not observed for 63 per cent of the cases in our sample because abortion is illegal in those countries. Abortion is registered in only 33 countries in our sample. Therefore, the abortion rate does not take on values for 56 cases. Tobit analysis allows us to determine the effect of the independent variables on cases above the threshold (countries with non-zero values for the abortion rate), factoring in the characteristics of countries without values. Thus, tobit analysis avoids the bias incurred by only examining the determinants of the abortion rate (using OLS regression) among countries in which abortion is not censored. Tobit analysis, in essence, allows us to control for cases in which abortion is not legal.
RESULTS
LEGAL STATUS OF ABORTION
Table 2 presents the correlation matrix and descriptive statistics for the variables used in the analysis. As expected, at the bivariate level higher levels of development are associated with abortion being legal (r = 0.59). Abortion is more likely legal in countries with higher female labor force participation rates (r = 0.30). Also as expected, abortion is less likely to be legal in countries with large Catholic populations and in predominantly Moslem countries (r = -0.20 and r = -0.39, respectively).
Table 3 presents the results from the logistic regression analysis of the legal

status of abortion. The coefficients in the table refer to the relationship between the independent variables and the log odds of abortion being legal. The development index has a positive effect on whether abortion is legal. As predicted, higher levels of development increase the likelihood of abortion being legal in a nation. Although in the predicted direction, the female labor force participation rate does not have a significant effect on the legality of abortion after controlling for other national social indicators. As expected, both a larger percentage of Catholics in a population and the predominance of Islam significantly lower the likelihood of abortion being legal in a country.6
THE ABORTION RATE
Table 4 presents the results of the tobit analysis for the General Abortion Rate. Since the final tobit model is difficult to interpret, we proceed in steps. The coefficients for Equation 1, the baseline model, show that all the variables in the model, except "Moslem country," have significant effects. Equation 2 tests for the predicted curvilinear effect of socioeconomic development.

The final model (Equation 4) results in a significant improvement over the earlier comparison model (Equation 2, as indicated by the change in chi-square). The final model shows that the "percentage Catholic" continues to exert a significant negative effect and "Moslem country" remains nonsignificant, controlling for other factors. Importantly, the coefficients presented in Equation 4 show that the effect of development is curvilinear and that the interaction effect between the development index and the female labor force participation rate is significant.

The nature of these effects on the abortion rate is complex and difficult to interpret simply by viewing the tobit coefficients reported in Table 4. A common mistake made when interpreting tobit coefficients is to assume they are effects of the independent variables on the dependent variable for cases that are above the limit, when, in fact, these tobit coefficients provide information on two types of effects--the effects of the independent variables on values falling below the threshold and the effects of the independent variables on values falling above the threshold (McDonald and Moffitt, 1980; Roncek, 1992). It is the latter group of effects that are of interest here and that we discuss below.
Therefore, we derive and present in Table 5 unit change estimates for abortion

values above the threshold derived from the tobit analysis reported in Table 4, Equation 4 (see Roncek, 1992). These estimates show how a unit increase for a given independent variable changes the abortion rate in those countries where abortion is observed (Roncek, 1992). For example, the results reported in Table 5 show that a unit increase in the percentage Catholic implies an expected decrease of 1.641 in the abortion rate in countries where abortion is observed. The estimates presented in Table 5 are used to derive figures that more clearly illustrate the nonlinear/nonadditive effect of socioeconomic development and the nonadditive effect of female labor force participation on the abortion rate.

development.8 In other words, Figure 1 demonstrates how the effect of female labor force participation on abortion varies at different levels of development. As predicted, the effect of female labor force participation on abortion is positive. This figure also shows that the positive effect of female labor force participation on abortion initially grows stronger with increases in development, with the positive effect remaining but diminishing with further increases in development. These findings lend partial support to our original hypothesis. For scores falling approximately below 6.52 on the development index, our initial theoretical argument holds, suggesting that the effect of female labor force participation is stronger in more developed nations where the type of

work women do creates more conflict between the roles of mother and paid worker. However, for higher than average levels of development (scores falling approximately above 6.52--slightly above the mean) further increases in development weaken the positive effect of female labor force participation on abortion, suggesting perhaps that the roles of mother and paid worker become less conflicted as nations become even more developed. Perhaps in more highly developed nations more liberal work policies for women are adopted and institutionalized child care is more widely available and thus the potential conflict between the roles of mother and worker is weakened. Also, in these highly developed countries contraceptive use presumably would be at its highest level and thus unwanted pregnancy rates would be at their lowest. Importantly, the overall effect of female labor force participation on abortion is positive. Higher rates of female labor force participation are related to higher rates of abortion. However, that positive effect grows weaker at higher than average levels of socioeconomic development.
Figure 2 shows the changing effect of development at varying levels of female labor force participation, taking into account both the curvilinear effect of development and the interaction effect between

development and female labor force participation.9 Figure 2 illustrates the impact of female labor force participation on socioeconomic development's effect (at the development index's mean, and one standard deviation below and above the mean) at values ranging between the first and ninth deciles of female labor force participation. This figure illustrates that the effect of development on the abortion rate becomes progressively stronger with higher levels of female labor force participation, and that the overall effect of development on the abortion rate is greater with increases in development.

Although Figure 2 illustrates the interaction between development and female labor force participation, this figure does not illustrate the curvilinear nature of the relationship between development and the abortion rate. To illustrate this, Figure 3 shows the relationship between socioeconomic development and abortion for two values of female labor force participation (when female labor force participation is at its mean and one standard deviation above its mean), holding the religion variables constant at their means.10 Thus, Figure 3 illustrates the predicted values of abortion at different levels of socioeconomic development. At low levels of development the abortion rate is low; with increases in development, the abortion rate rises; then with further increases in development, the abortion rate begins to fall. This pattern

supports the argument that at very low levels of development, abortion is low because of the high demand and greater social and economic value placed on children. As levels of development increase, abortion rates rise in concert with social and economic pressures to limit family size. At some threshold further increases in development are associated with a leveling off or decline in abortion rates presumably as efficient contraceptive behavior becomes more universally practiced in a population.
CONCLUSION
By considering the combined effects of development, female labor force participation, and religion on abortion, we have examined the net effects of factors theoretically associated with abortion, but not previously demonstrated empirically. In a sample of 89 more developed and less developed countries, we have shown that these social forces exert significant influence on the legal status of abortion and its incidence rate, although in different ways. The multi-item development index bears a significant relationship to the probability of abortion being legal and also to the abortion rate. The female labor force participation rate does not have a significant effect on the legal status of abortion, but does significantly affect the abortion rate. Both the development index and the female labor force participation rate exhibit complex relationships to the abortion rate. Increases in social and economic development appear to initially increase the rate of abortion, but ultimately lower the incidence of abortion. Female labor force participation has a positive effect on abortion rates, although the effect grows weaker at higher than average levels of socioeconomic de-

velopment. The percentage Catholic in national populations significantly affects both the legal status of abortion and its rate. Abortion is overwhelmingly less likely to be legal in Moslem countries than in other countries.
It is interesting to note that the labor force activity of women exerts a significant influence on abortion rates, but has no significant effect on the legal status of abortion. It appears that the labor force activity of women influences the more private fertility behaviors of women, but does not affect the more public arena of state policy regarding abortion. The legal status of abortion appears to be more a reflection of the level of modernization in a society rather than any level of structural power held by women.
Future studies might profitably attempt to corroborate the findings of this analysis by investigating the relationship between socioeconomic development and women's labor force participation on abortion within particular populations, for other time periods, and over time. Since the conclusions of this study are based on cross-sectional data, investigating the nature of these complex relationships over time would be a particularly fruitful direction of research. For example, it may be that high levels of abortion increase women's labor force activity (because women's domestic labor is reduced) rather than the reverse relationship assumed in this study, that high rates of female labor force participation increase abortion. A longitudinal research design could better address the causal relationship between women's labor force participation and abortion rates.
Future research should also explore the relationships among socioeconomic development, women's labor force participation, contraceptive use, and abortion.

A limitation of this study is our inability to control for the extent of contraceptive use in the nations under study. Contraceptive use data are only available for about half of the countries in our sample. And, among those few countries with contraceptive use data, contraceptive use is very highly correlated with socioeconomic development. Therefore, we cannot determine how much of the effect of socioeconomic development on the abortion rate is due to the reduced value of having children or to women's access and adoption of contraceptive technology.
Our study also suggests that the nature of work in different societies has varying implications for women, and in that sense other indicators of women's status beyond their labor force participation may be needed to understand the effects of women's status on national abortion legal codes. For example, the political power necessary to make abortion legal may be more associated with women's level of education and their political presence than their labor force activity. Future studies should explore multidimensional factors of women's status and relate these to abortion law.
Finally, while our findings on the effect of Catholicism on abortion may not be surprising, future studies should explore in greater detail the relationship between the predominance of Catholicism and abortion. As mentioned earlier, in some countries, such as the United States, there is little difference between the abortion behavior of Catholics and non-Catholics. As one reviewer suggested, there may be an interaction effect between socioeconomic development and the predominance of Catholicism on the rate of abortion. For example, countries with relatively high percentages of

Catholics and lower levels of socioeconomic development may have significantly lower rates of abortion than countries with high percentages of Catholics and higher levels of development. It may well be that the level of modernization tempers the influence of Catholic doctrine on abortion behavior. Indeed, it is generally thought that religion becomes more individualistic and less doctrinaire as societies economically develop and modernize (e.g., Bellah, 1970).
In sum, this study provides a theoretical framework for explaining cross-national abortion patterns developed from descriptive studies of abortion and from more general comparative theories of fertility behavior and closely examines cross-national variation in abortion using more sophisticated multivariate analytic techniques than any previous study. The analysis and results presented here suggest that prior research on national level abortion rates has not clearly established the complexities of the dual influence of socioeconomic development and women's labor force participation on abortion and, thus, perhaps oversimplifies the nature of cross-national variation in abortion. Our results suggest, at the very least, that the relationships between a society's level of development, the labor force activity of women, and abortion rates are rather complex, and simple linear associations cannot be presumed.
