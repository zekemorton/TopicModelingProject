ABSTRACT: The frequency distribution of various consanguineous marriages was studied in the city of Madras, Tamil Nadu, South India. Parallel first cousin marriages (PFC) were found to occur in appreciable frequencies in all caste groups of Hindus. While it has been generally believed that PFC marriages among Hindus are mere exceptions and are usually not tolerated, our data show that they can no longer be treated as exceptions. The high frequency (27 per cent) of PFC marriages in some Hindu communities necessitates in-depth studies to elucidate the forces at work which go against the very fundamentals of Dravidian kinship.

In human societies, matings between individuals largely associate with the social institutions of marriage, and consanguineous marriages (CM) are largely reflections of cultural behavior of the mating groups (Reid, 1973). Over the past three decades several contributions have been made on inbreeding in India and its theoretical and empirical risks (Sanghvi, 1954; Dronamraju and Meerakhan, 1963; Sanghvi, 1966; Centerwal and Centerwal, 1966; Rao et al., 1972; Roy Choudhury, 1976; Rao and Inbaraj, 1977; Srikumari et al., 1985).
In South India the inbreeding rates are very high, although not as high as the values of inbreeding that have been reported in some of the human isolates living in Western parts of the world. However, it is noteworthy that the practice of marrying the father's brother's daughter (FBD) or mother's sister's daughter (MSD), i.e., parallel cousin marriages, is forbidden in Hindu society, since they are thought to be as sisters. In contrast,

in Middle Eastern cultures FBD marriage, which is taboo in many cultures of the world (Murphy and Kasdan, 1967), is overtly preferred. This practice hasreceived much attention in the literature on marriage in the Middle east (Ayoub, 1959; Patai, 1962; Gilbert and Hammel, 1966; Goldberg, 1967, Khuri, 1970).
In India, studies on Tamil Nadu as a whole are available (Rao et al., 1972; Rao and Inbaraj, 1977,1980), but there has been no study exclusively on inbreeding in Madras city, an important metropolis of South India. Changing patterns in marriage preferences corresponding to changing matrimonial behavior in modern urban life styles, especially in a city like Madras, need systematic sampling and study.
The detection of an an association between endogamy, religious affiliation, and socioeconomic status has implications for future genetic studies in this area. As stressed by many authors (Neel and Schull, 1970; Rao and Inbaraj,

The general formula of Malecot (1948) has been used for computing the coefficient of inbreeding.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Madras is the fourth largest city in India. The sample used here was selected using stratified random sampling techniques. The city was divided longitudinally into North, Central, and South and vertically into East and West. The city as a whole was divided into 81 areas identified on the city map. Then 10 per cent of the 81 areas, proportionate to the number of areas in each of the five zones as divided longitudinally and vertically, were randomly selected.
Within a given area all houses located on either side of every fifth street were included. Care was taken to give representation to the slums. A standard questionnaire was prepared both in English and in the local language, Tamil. Respondents were personally visited. After the objectives of the study were explained to them, they were asked tofill out the questionnaire. Of the sample, 88 per cent (3,527 couples) filled out the questionnaires.
Of the respondents, 81.5 per cent were Hindus. Christians and Muslims constituted 15.5 and 2.7 per cent of the sample, respectively. Couples belonging to different religions and castes, 0.3 and 0.4 per cent respectively, were excluded from the analysis. All caste groups constituting 1per cent or more of the sample were listed separately.
The remaining caste groups were grouped into four categories: (1) Other South Indian Brahmins (OSIB); (2) Other South Indian castes (OSIC); (3)

sibs (cross first cousins, CFC) are more frequent than marriages between the children of like-sexed sibs (parallelfirst cousins, PFC). CFC marriages constituted about 91per cent of allfirstcousin marriages. In CFC marriages, the ratio between mother's brother's daughter (MBD) and father's sister's daughter (FSD) marriages was 1.23. However, in a study of the state of Tamil Nadu as a whole (Rao and Inbaraj, 1977), MBD marriages were significantly more frequent than FSD marriages. In PFC marriagesthe ratio between MSD and FBD marriages was 2.69:1 (Table 2).

of consanguineous marriage in Tamil Nadu has deeper impact than could be modified by the religious influences.
The relative frequency of CFC and PFC marriages also varied (Table 4). In Muslims, PFC marriages occurred in about 59 per cent of FCM marriages contracted. PFC marriages were more common among Christians (11per cent) than among Hindus (7 per cent).
Of the two types of CFC marriages among Hindus and Muslims, FSD marriages were more frequent than MBD marriages. The ratio of MBD and FSD marriages among Hindus was 1:1.26and among Muslims, 1:1.33. Among Christians, both MBD and FSD marriages were equally frequent.
Of the two types of PFC marriages, Muslims preferred FBD marriages, while Hindu and Christians preferred MSD marriages.
FREQUENCY OF CONSANGUINEOUS
MARRIAGES IN CASTE GROUPS OF HINDUS
Hindu social hierarchy is a complex network of caste groups based on varied factors like occupation, customs, beliefs, migrations, and a host of other influences, resulting in a remarkable degree of isolation among the groups. However, these caste isolates are slowly becoming separated from their traditional environments and being incorporated into the general pool.
Table 5 shows the distribution of couples by type of marriage among caste groups of Hindus. Consanguineous marriages varied from 3 per cent in Jains to about 37 per cent in Achari. Consanguineous marriages represented more than 30 per cent of marriages in 6 of the 12 caste groups listed (Mudaliar, Adi Dravidar, Naicker, Chettiar, Achari, and Pillai). The consanguinity rate was

in the range of 20-30 per cent among Naidu, Nadar, and Yadava and below 20 per cent in Tamil Brahmins, Nairs, and Jains.
UN marriages were highest in Acharis (18per cent) and lowest in Nairs (3 per cent). Except for the Acharis, FCM marriages were more frequent than UN marriages in all caste groups.
The proportion of PFC marriages varied from 2 per cent in Tamil Brahmins to about 27 per cent in Pillai. It is interesting to note that Brahmins who are more stringent in adhering to certain social norms also showed a small per cent of PFC marriages. However, it is not clear how Brahmins compare with Nadars and Acharis who showed no PFC marriages.
Of the two types of CFC marriages, a greater frequency of FSD marriages relative to MBD marriages was found in the Mudaliar, Tamil Brahmin, and Adi Dravida caste groups. The Naidu, Naicker, Chettiar, Nadar, Nair, Achari, and Yadava caste groups preferred MBD marriages over FSD marriages.
COEFFICIENT OF INBREEDING
The coefficient of inbreeding (F)was computed in different caste groups of Hindus, Christians, and Muslims to be about 2 per cent, including all populations of Madras. The value of F was 2.2 per cent among Hindus and about 2.1 per cent among Muslims, while it was only 1.1 per cent among Christians.
Among the caste groups of Hindus, the value of Fvaried from 0.2 per cent in Jains to 3.5 per cent in Achari. Except for the Pillai where it was 2.9 per cent, the value of F in most of the populations (Naidu, Adi Dravidar, Naicker, Chettiar, and Yadava) was between 2 and 2.5 per cent. Due to small sample size, the value of F for North Indian Brahmins

(2.68 per cent) was found to be higher than the value found in Brahmins of Tamil (1.45 per cent) and South India (0.43 per cent). Excluding Jains (0.19 per cent), the lowest F was for Nairs (0.94 per cent).
DISCUSSION
This study forms an ideal background for better inbreeding studies in Madras. One of the most important findings of the present study is the occurrence of PFC marriages in appreciable frequencies. They can no longer be treated as "exceptional," or "as seen now and then" in fishermen and farmers (Sanghvi, 1956).
Among Muslims, for whom PFC marriages are perfectly legitimate, the frequency of abut 59 per cent is not surprising. The fact that the frequency of PFC marriages is as high as 27 per cent among some Hindu communities necessitates in-depth studies to elucidate the forces at work which go against the basic principles of Dravidian kinship as it has been understood and propagated by various authors. Whether such marriageshave occurred with or without parental approval or the approval of the community as such is not a prime factor. What is significant is to determine the sociocultural and economic implications of such marriages and the impact that such marriages have had and may have on the kinship structure of the people.
Rao and Inbaraj (1977) also reported PFC marriages among Hindu rurals and urbans of North Arcot district, Tamil Nadu state, as about 2 per cent of all FCM marriages, but they did not offer any explanation. In South Indian popu-

lations, which show greater preference for consanguineous marriages, a host of economic considerations and social factors influence the incidence. Precedence of parental decision over individual choice and the necessity of maintaining harmonious relations within the family are factors that greatly influence decisions in favor of consanguineous marriages (Dronamraju, 1964; Reid, 1973; Rao and Inbaraj, 1977). Consanguineous marriages and extended families were both part of a common proclivity for wider kinship ties among the Desuri Kapus of Andhra Pradesh (Govinda Reddy, 1986). Respondents in that study offered a variety of reasons, such as to maintain traditional relationships, to retain property, to avoid dowry, parental decisions, love, etc., for marrying a relative. Khun (1970) demonstrates that parallel cousin marriage, a wellknown practice in the Middle East, nullifies the effects of marriage on the intensity of family relationships.
In spite of the modern geographic dispersal of relatives, consanguineous marriage continues as a cultural practice, as observed in this study from the high rates of consanguinity irrespective of the place of birth of the spouses. The near uniform rates of inbreeding in different age groups of women suggests no temporal trends in this study, but significant differences in consanguineous marriages could be observed by religion and caste.
While consanguineous marriages continue, seeming to indicate that tradition is overriding education and urbanization, perhaps the frequency of PFC marriages indicates that urbanization is resulting in a relaxation of the regulations of Dravidian kinship.
