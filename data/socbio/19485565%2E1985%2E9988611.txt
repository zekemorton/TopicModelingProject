ABSTRACT: Students of the actions of ethyl alcohol have often divided these actions conceptually into avidity, sensitivity, tolerance, and dependence. Here at the University of Colorado Alcohol Research Center, we are engaged in development of an animal model for further study of the mechanisms which underlie dependence. To this end we are undertaking genetic selection for differential severity of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome in the laboratory mouse. Results are presented for 12 generations of replicate line, bidirectional, within-family artificial selection. The results to date are discussed with reference to natural selection, whose effects are adding unforeseen complications to the selection response.

search, and two recent monographs (Eriksson et al., 1980; McClearn et al., 1981) have stressed the utility of employing animal models for study of alcohol-related behaviors and mechanisms.
Shortly after the formation of the University of Colorado Alcohol Research Center in 1978, with its emphasis on genetic mechanisms, a group of coinvestigators, including DeFries, Erwin, McClearn, Petersen, and myself, began to discuss the development of a new animal model for the study of alcohol dependence. These discussions led to the design of several pilot experiments to determine an effective means of inducing mice to consume sufficient ethanol to develop dependence. We tried several different regimens, including inhalation of ethanol vapor. Though promising, the technique had two major drawbacks: (1) Control of dosage was difficult, and there was a great deal of variation in effective dose among the individual mice within an inhalation chamber; and (2) respiratory illnesses were common among the treated mice. It should be noted that Crabbe et al. (1983) have successfully employed the inhalation technique for dosing mice by incorporating pyrazole injections into their treatment regimen to control effective dosage (Goldstein, 1973). We had, of course, known about this technique, but wished to avoid the use of a second drug, if possible. Finally, we settled on dosing via inclusion of ethanol in a liquid diet furnished as the sole source of nutrients.
One useful result of the pilot experiments concerning dosing techniques was our finding that dependence could be induced in mice after just 9 days on the alcohol-laced diet, as measured by con-

ventional pharmacological criteria such as spontaneous seizures and loss of body temperature. We were thus reassured that this dosing method was feasible, albeit moderately difficult.
For actual development of an animal model of dependence, we rather naturally turned to the technique of genetic selection--led, no doubt by the proven utility of the long-sleep (LS) and shortsleep (SS) mice which had been selected for sensitivity to ethanol by McClearn and Kakihana (1973; 1981). Collins (1981) has reviewed many of the studies that have used these selected lines. To begin genetic selection, however, we needed to choose an index of selection. Examining our pilot data once again, we decided that the pharmacological construct of dependence could perhaps be measured more fully by using several measures in addition to seizure susceptibility and temperature loss. Principal component analyses of data sets which included these measures, along with others, indicated that a first principal component (1PC) score derived from seven physiological and behavioral measures was likely to be a more complete measure of dependence. The derivation of this 1PC index is discussed more fully by McClearn et al. (1982).
Having determined to follow the rather radical notion of selecting on a composite index derived by a multivariate procedure, we began genetic selection in 1979, with the expectation that the lines produced would prove useful for eventual anatomical, pharmacological, and physiological studies concerning the mechanism(s) underlying dependence. Progress reports on this study are available in Allen et al. (1983) and Wilson et al. (1984).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
As the detailed methodology being employed is available within the two references cited immediately above, only an abbreviated version is included here.
SUBJECTS
As a foundation population to begin selection, 111 male and 89 female heterogeneous stock (HS) mice (McClearn et al., 1970) were used. All mice in this study are bred, reared, maintained, and tested under specific-pathogen-free conditions.
ETHANOL TREATMENTS
A Lieber-DeCarli Liquid diet (IsoCal, Bio-Serv, Inc., No. 711-PRA) is used as the sole source of food. Beginning at age 65 days (originally, 85 days), mice are housed individually and presented for 2 days with the liquid diet prepared to contain 10 per cent ethanolderived calories (e.d.c); during the 2 subsequent days, the e.d.c. concentration is raised to 20 per cent; for the remaining 5 days of treatment, the concentration is raised to 35 per cent e.d.c. The diet is presented in inverted graduated cylinders; fresh diet is furnished twice daily, at which times the amount consumed is recorded. At 0700 on the day following the 9-day treatment period, the ethanol diet is withdrawn, and laboratory chow, control liquid diet (no ethanol), and tap water are furnished.
APPARATUS AND TESTING
Testing begins 6 hours after withdrawal of the ethanol diet. Though a larger number of scores are recorded during testing, only the specific seven

scores which are used to define the 1PC selection index are described below. The 1PC index is derived separately for males and females, as the component weightings are somewhat different. The seven scores making up the 1PC index are: (1) Ethanol consumption is calculated across the 9 days of treatment and converted to grams of ethanol consumed per kilogram of body weight. (2) Using a modification of the procedures described by Goldstein and Pal (1971), seizure severity is assessed using a 4point scale. (3) HW entry latency, (4) spontaneous HW seizures, and (5) HW crossings are recorded during a 3minute test in a hole-in-wall (HW) apparatus (McClearn et al., 1970). (6) Body temperature is recorded. (7) Total VS crossings are recorded during a 3minute test in a vertical screen (VS) apparatus (McClearn et al., 1982).
SELECTIVE BREEDING
Using the 1PC derived from the seven measures described above (see McClearn et al., 1982, for weighting coefficients), we began artificial selection. First, 10 families (litters) from the base population were randomly chosen. A male and a female were then randomly chosen from each family and were mated randomly inter se to begin Control Line Number 1 (Q). Next, the male and the female in each family which had the largest 1PC scores were selected and mated randomly interse to begin Severe Ethanol Withdrawal Line Number 1 (SEWj). From each of these same families, the male and the female with the lowest 1PC scores were selected and mated randomly inter se to begin Mild Ethanol Withdrawal Line Number 1 (MEWj). From a second set of 10 families from the base population, C2,

dependent f-tests) of line divergence (SEWj vs. MEW! and SEW2 vs. MEW2) have confirmed separation from Generation 7 onwards.
The odd response of the Q line has puzzled us for sometime. We have confirmed that the response has not been the result of (inadvertent) selection pressure from choice of random samples for mating which happened to show unusually low expression of the ethanol withdrawal syndrome. The most likely explanation for the oddity of response is genetic drift, with the non-random gene arrays within the 10families constituting the line in one of the early generations having arisen as a result of genetic losses from the premature death or infertility

of animals within this line, as explained below. Whether or not this explanation is correct, the problem does seem to have resolved itself, as the response of this line in the last two or three generations has been reasonably intermediate.
Comparison of the responses by sex (Fig. 1 vs. Fig. 2) shows that males are much more affected by the treatment regimen, with four of the six lines appearing above the abscissa and the other two barely below. Responses of the females, in contrast, are more symmetrical; if anything, they have an overall downward trend. Even our early pilot studies had identified a lesser response in females to alcohol withdrawal. These results highlight their "resistance" even

more, as the component weightings used to define the separate (by sex) lPCs arequite similar. At this pointwe can only speculate that the greater resistance in females maybe dueto their higher estrogen/androgen ratio during development andmaturity.
The generation-to-generation irregularities inthe response plots were earlier thought to be due to unknown deviations inthe laboratory environment. We had even attempted to clarify theselection response byplotting all responsesas deviations from the overall generation mean (Allen et al., 1983), on the assumption that environmental deviations should affect all sixlines about equally.

Though this plotting option may wellbe useful on occasion, wenow believe that these particular results are better expressed without prior subtraction of the generation mean. The reasons for this are discussed below.
In Generation 10, average realized (within-family) heritabilities for the response to selection (Wilson et al.,1984) ranged from 0(MEWj) to 0.23 (SEWj). If these estimates are converted tothe form obtained from a mass selectiondesign, they are in the vicinity of 0.2, on the average. Estimation ofrealized heritabilities here is complicated by the asymmetry of response by the two sexes.

ance between two conflicting demands: The animal must (1) eat enough to ensure survival, and (2) not over-indulge, or death may ensue during withdrawal. For the artificial selection project, we had assumed that average consumption would remain approximately constant, as it is the resultant of positive hunger motivation and the mildly aversive dietalcohol mixture offered. It would appear that natural selection, working on

individual differences in this resultant, has operated to increase dramatically the average alcohol dosage. Animals from later generations (especially females) are now able to survive the very large alcohol doses they voluntarily consume. The shifts in the death and infertility rates across generations may be seen to be associated with different phases of the increase in average consumption, as the pendulum swings now
