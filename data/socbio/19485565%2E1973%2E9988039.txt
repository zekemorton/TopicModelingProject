Premarital Pregnancy: A Record Linkage Analysis

The primary concern of this paper is the prediction and analysis of premarital pregnancy, one of the components of population growth. It is becoming increasingly clear that fertility rates are most easily changed by meeting the established needs of a population, rather than by creating needs where none previously existed or trying to change attitudes that exist but are opposed to the changes desired. To the extent that premarital pregnancies in the United States are unwanted pregnancies (or at least not strongly desired), their identification is, in effect, the definition of a target group whose fertility rates should be easily lowered, resulting in a lower rate for the total population.
The data on premarital pregnancy used here come from the linkage of marriage and birth records rather than from interviews and thereby avoid many of the problems of response bias. There is no opportunity for the persons involved to refuse to respond or to falsify their responses, an important asset in studying a topic as sensitive as premarital pregnancy. On the other hand, the analysis is restricted to the data present on the marriage and birth records, including their accuracy and completeness. Obviously there

is no opportunity to probe into a response or ask additional questions on the basis of a previous response. Despite this liability, the method of record linkage is probably one of the most useful tools available to social science in the study of sensitive topics such as fertility and sexual behavior.
Previous isolated studies have shown that rates of premarital pregnancy vary systematically with age, occupational status, ruralurban residence, marriage officiant, religion, and race; but none have analyzed these variables simultaneously for the same population over time to see how they produce their effects. In general, the literature indicates a negative relationship between age at marriage and premarital pregnancy (Christensen, 1963a; Lowrie, 1965; U.S. Public Health Service, 1970; Monahan, 1960), although several of these studies indicate a slightly curvilinear association, with the highest incidences of premarital pregnancy at the youngest and oldest extremes of those marrying for the first time.
Christensen and Meissner (19S3), Dooghe (1968), and Monahan (1960) have all shown a clear inverse relationship between premarital pregnancy and occupational status (or a similar indicator of

socioeconomic status) for whites. However, in controlling for race, the Monahan study found no similar trend for blacks.
Data on rural-urban differences are very scanty, principally due to classification problems resulting from migration. There is slight evidence for higher rates of premarital pregnancy for urban residents than rural farm residents (Christensen, 1953). Kinsey et al. (1948, p. 455) also found that urban males at all age and occupational levels were more frequently involved in premarital intercourse than were rural males. This higher rate of intercourse does not necessarily imply that urban males are more frequently involved in premarital pregnancy.
Pratt (1965), Christensen (19636), and Monahan (1960) have shown that premarital pregnancy occurs more frequently in couples eventually married by civil ceremonies than in those married by religious ceremonies, when the couples are white. However, Monahan found for blacks that rates of premarital pregnancy were higher for those married by religious ceremonies than those married by civil ceremonies. It should be noted that the marriage officiant is of no use as a predictor of premarital pregnancy, since the pregnancy precedes the marriage ceremony.
One study has related religion to premarital pregnancy (Barber, 1967) and showed that in religiously homogeneous marriages Protestants had the highest rate, Catholics an intermediate rate, and Jews the lowest rate of premarital pregnancy. The same study also found that rates of premarital pregnancy were slightly higher for interfaith than intrafaith marriages.
Race has been found to be strongly related to premarital pregnancy with blacks displaying higher rates than whites (U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, 1962; U.S. Public Health Service, 1970; Monahan, 1960). No research has

been done on premarital pregnancy rates for interracial marriages.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The parent populations for the present study consisted of all marriages and births in the state of Indiana for the years 196267. There were approximately 286,000 marriage records and 550,000 birth records provided by the Indiana State Board of Health on magnetic tape prepared from the vital records of the state. From the parent marriage population were selected all records for Lake County, Indiana (Gary, Hammond, East Chicago, etc.), in which (1) the marriage license was issued in Lake County and/or the groom listed Lake County as his county of residence, and (2) the record indicated a first marriage for both bride and groom. Lake County was selected for study because of the social and cultural heterogeneity of its population. The application of these criteria reduced the parent marriage population to 19,325 cases (see Table 1 for the characteristics of this population).
From the parent birth population were selected all records meeting the following criteria: (1) all cases in which the birth was attributed to a resident of Lake County (whether or not it occurred there); (2) all cases meeting the previous criterion which represented a first birth to the mother; (3) all cases meeting the two previous criteria which were classified as legitimate by the birth attendant. Application of these criteria reduced the birth population to 14,275 cases.
The marriage and birth files obtained in this way were then linked on a 32K IBM 7094-1 using a modification of two-staged linkage methods developed in studies by Newcombe et al. (1959), Newcombe and Kennedy (1962), and Kennedy et al. (1964). Comparison of the marriage file of 19,325 records and the birth file of 14,275

records yielded 6,943 linked records which were accepted initially or on the detailed comparisons. Removal of linkages with negative weights from the detailed comparisons (indicating a low probability of the validity of the linkage) left 6,359 marriage-birth linkages. Thus, first births were found for 32.9% of all marriages (45.2% for 1962 marriages alone). Failure to match could have been the result of migration out of the search area after marriage there, no birth during the period for which the records were searched, or mistakes in the records which caused valid linkages to be rejected as invalid.
DETERMINATION OF PREMARITAL PREGNANCY
In determining percentages of premarital pregnancy for a population with record linkage, the length of record search must be taken into account because short interval searches include a relatively higher proportion of short interval births, thus artificially inflating the proportion classified as premaritally pregnant. In the present study, search spans varied from zero to a maximum of six years. It is possible, however, to determine the magnitude and direction of bias caused by the inclusion of short search spans from the data in Table 2.
This table compares the composite population (1962-67 marriages) with the 1962 marriage population alone on the distribution of relevant characteristics. Column %A-%B indicates percentage differences between the distributions, with positive deviations indicating overrepresentation of a particular level of a variable in the composite population, relative to what the linkages for the 1962 marriage population alone indicated.
In the present study, two criteria were employed simultaneously in the determination of premarital-postmarital pregnancy. The first was the interval between marriage

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS

TABLE 4

Nominal variables may be used in linear multiple regression analysis after converting them to binary form (Kendall, 1961). These binary variables are then used to estimate the intercept in the linear model. When binary variables alone are used as independent variables and the dependent variable is continuous with the error term normally distributed, the regression model is equivalent to the analysis of variance model (Cook, 1971).
Regression models with binary dependent variables violate one of the assumptions underlying linear regression analysis-- that the error term is homoscedastic. Goldberger (1964) has shown, however, that this liability does not bias the estimate of the regression coefficients, but it does lower the efficiency of the parameter estimates. This should be taken into account in the interpretation of the P coefficients obtained in the present analysis.
The structural equation in which premarital pregnancy is the variable to be explained has the following form:

RESULTS
DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSIS
Table 4 contains the descriptive data from the marriage-birth linkage analysis. It should be noted that the percentages presented here overstate the true rate of

premarital pregnancy because of the inclusion of short record search spans. The relative positions of categories should not be affected however (see Table 2 for estimates of the direction and magnitude of bias).
The expected direct relationship was found between age at marriage and rate of premarital pregnancy, with the high of 62.6% found for grooms 18 and less and the lowof 16.4% for those 25 and more.
The relationship for race was also as expected. The highest rate of 54.6% was found for blacks and the lowest of 23.7% for whites. The interracial marriages (n = 15) had a premarital pregnancy rate inter-

mediate between those of the racially homogeneous marriages (33.3%). Thus, premarital pregnancy is more likely to occur in interracial than white marriages, but less likely than in homogeneous black marriages.
The expected inverse relationship between occupational status and premarital pregnancy appeared, but the difference between the medium and low levels was very small (0.8%). The introduction of age as a test variable into the basic relationship (those at the younger age levels are less likely to have completed training which would allow them to score high on a scale of occupational status) revealed a more curvilinear relationship with the highest rate for the medium occupational status level and the lowest for the high and low levels (Table 5). Thus, either coding problems in the vital records are obscuring the relationship, or there is no particularly marked relationship between occupational status and premarital pregnancy for the total population.

For the intrafaith marriages, Protestants had the highest rate of premarital pregnancy (32.5%), Catholics an intermediate rate (18.2%) and Jews the lowest rate (16.7%). Intrafaith marriages taken together had a lower rate of premarital pregnancy (27.5%) than did interfaith marriages (34.3%). All of the findings with respect to religion were congruent with expectation.
A surprising finding was that foreignborn couples had a higher rate of premarital pregnancy than did couples of mixed ethnicity (21.1% versus 17.9%). Introduction of religion as a test variable into the basic relationship revealed that foreignborn Catholics had a rate of premarital pregnancy almost twice as high as foreignborn Protestants (Table 6). I t is likely that these Catholics are relatively recent arrivals from Central America and Puerto Rico, given the incidence of Spanish surnames in the marriage and birth records. Additional analysis, however, would be required to

ascertain whether or not this is actually the case.
Another result congruent with expectation (but with no previous data for comparison) was the highest rate of premarital pregnancy for urban couples (28.9%), an intermediate rate for couples of mixed residence (21.4%), and the lowest rate for rural couples (19.1%). This analysis is of particular importance in that it overcomes the bias found in previous descriptive analyses which determine rates of premarital pregnancy for geographic areas rather than for individuals.
REGRESSION ANALYSIS
Table 7 contains the results of the binary regression analysis and indicates that a

total of 14.96% of the variance in the dependent variable was explained by the independent variables used here. Age and race accounted for 92% of this with r2 values of 7.86 and 5.92% respectively. None of the other variables accounted for more than 1% of the variance, and altogether they accounted for only 1.18%. Thus, despite the interesting relationships described in the previous section, the variables used here have little value, by themselves, in predicting premarital pregnancy. The beta weights in Table 7 also bear noting. The highest weight of 0.4169 was found for the comparison between grooms 18 or less with those 25 or older. The next highest weight was found for the comparison of grooms age 18 or less with those age

The t values for the beta coefficients lend additional credence to the observation that race and age are the two best predictors of premarital pregnancy. All of the age

comparisons and the black-white race comparison yielded t values which were significant at the 0.001 level. In addition, the other-rural category for the residence variable was significant at the 0.001 level. Because of the relatively large number of cases in the "Other" category, additional work needs to be done to determine who
