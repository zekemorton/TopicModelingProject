ABSTRACT: Ethnic differentials in neonatal and postneonatal mortality in a birth cohort of Spanish surname, white (non-Spanish), and nonwhite infants in Houston, Texas, were analyzed with legitimacy status, mother's age, birth order, and birth weight controlled separately and simultaneously. In the presence of all factors, Spanish surname and non-Spanish white infants had a neonatal mortality risk about 13 per cent below average; nonwhite (primarily Black) infants, 30 per cent above average. Adjusted for all four factors, the risk for nonwhites was 8 per cent below average and for Spanish surname infants 2 per cent below average, while it rose to almost 5 per cent above average for non-Spanish white infants. Birth weight and legitimacy status were responsible for most of the change. The four factors had less effect on postneonatal mortality, with legitimacy status seeming to have the greatest influence.

The decline in infant mortality in the United States has been one of the notable health accomplishments in this century. The rate of decline, however, has not been uniform for all racial and ethnic groups. Numerous studies have been conducted to document ethnic differentials in infant mortality. These studies have shown that nonwhite babies have a higher risk of dying than do their white counterparts (Shapiro et al., 1965; Shah and Abbey, 1971; Scurletis et al., 1973). While the white-nonwhite differentials have been widely documented, few studies have given attention to the Mexican-American group, a major ethnic group in the Southwest.
The vast majority of the research on infant mortality has been more descriptive than analytic. Although descriptive studies are important in order to examine patterns of disease and mortality trends (Fox et al., 1970), more analytic studies are needed to understand the patterns and

trends better. Many studies have indicated that infant mortality is associated with each of the following social and demographic factors: low birth weight; very young and very old mothers; the first order birth and very high order births; and illegitimacy (Chase, 1969; Erhardt et al., 1970; Chase and Erhardt, 1973; Burris, 1974). The most common analytic procedure to study these relations has been standardization or cross-classification. Unfortunately, this strategy has been severely hampered by practical limitations. The number of observations is usually too small to permit the separation of the effects of any more than two or three factors. Alternative analytic procedures employed in some studies include correlation, analysis of covariance and multiple regression (Wells et al., 1958; Cochran, 1957; Feldstein, 1966).
This study examines ethnic differentials in neonatal and postneonatal mortality among three ethnic groups: Spanish sur-

name, white (other than Spanish surname), and nonwhite (virtually all Blacks). In our analysis the effects of various social and demographic factors are controlled separately and simultaneously by means of a binary variable multiple regression method. This study analyzes infant deaths in a birth cohort rather than infant deaths and live births that occurred in a calendar year.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The basic data source for this study is the birth and infant death certificate information for the years 1958-60 obtained from the Houston Health Department. Infant death certificates were matched with their birth certificates so that variables from both records might be utilized. The birth cohort analyzed in this study comprises single live-born infants in Houston, Texas, born to Houston residents during the years 1958 and 1959. Plural births are excluded since additional factors are involved in mortality associated with these births. The total population size of this study included 46,320 single live births. A total of 118 live births were excluded because of erroneous or missing information for certain items.
The major limitation of our data is the omission of infant deaths among the 1958-59 birth cohort that were registered outside of Houston (infant deaths among out-migrants). This omission poses less of a problem for neonatal mortality than for postneonatal mortality. Although it is very difficult to assess the magnitude of this problem directly, an examination of unmatched infant deaths (infant deaths among in-migrants) may provide an indirect indication. Since Houston is a rapidly growing city, the number of infant deaths among out-migrants is believed to be smaller than the unmatched infant deaths. Only 4.2 per cent of resident infant deaths registered in Houston during the study

period could not be matched with births (2.9 per cent for neonatal and 8.6 per cent for postneonatal deaths). The percentage of unmatched infant deaths was about the same for all three ethnic groups (3.2 per cent for Spanish surnames, 4.4 per cent for other whites, and 4.1 per cent for nonwhites). This finding suggests that the omission of deaths among out-migrants would not significantly affect ethnic differentials observed in this study, although the overall mortality rate is slightly underestimated.
Identification of Spanish surnames was achieved by means of a computer scan of surnames on certificates. The computer program was originally developed by Buechley (1961). It identifies over 95 per cent of all Spanish surnames as Spanish and only 2 per cent of non-Spanish names as Spanish (Jackson and Buechley, 1972). Although the computer approach obviously does not give results equivalent to the census bureau's hand-coding procedure, it is satisfactory for the present study since census figures are not used to compute rates. The more important question is whether the Spanish surname criterion is satisfactory in identifying MexicanAmericans in Houston. While the problems of using a Spanish surname criterion are discussed extensively elsewhere (Hernandez et al., 1973), there is no other procedure available for use with existing vital statistics data. Information on birthplace of parents could be utilized in conjunction with the Spanish surname criterion, but unfortunately such information was not available in our data file.
Quantitative information on completeness of vital registration for the study period is not available. The nationwide tests of completeness conducted with the 1950 census showed that Houston's registration of white births was 99.2 per cent complete while nonwhite births were 98.2 per cent complete (U.S. Public Health Service,

19SS). It is believed that the completeness of death registration was equally good or even better than birth registration. Further improvement might have been accomplished by 1958, a major reason for the improvement being the increasing proportion of births occurring in a hospital (Spiegelman, 1970). The proportion of births taking place in hospitals in Houston increased from 96 per cent in 19S0 to 98 per cent in 1959 (City of Houston Health Department, 1959).
In this study, neonatal and postneonatal mortality are considered the dependent variables. The neonatal period is defined as the first 27 days of life, and the postneonatal period covers ages 28 days and over but less than one year. These dependent variables are compared among three ethnic groups with adjustments for the effects of other influential variables. The ethnic groups along with other influential factors are considered the independent variables. The following four factors are considered:
1. Legitimacy status. Two categories are considered: legitimate births, illegitimate births. 2. Age of mother. Five groups are formulated: less than 20, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35 and older. 3. Birth order. Five categories are used (considering live births only): first order, second order, third order, fourth order, and fifth and higher orders. 4. Birth weight. Since weight is reported in pounds and ounces on birth certificates, and over seven ounces is rounded up to the next pound, only three categories are considered: less than 5.5 pounds, greater than or equal to 5.5 pounds, and unknown birth weight.
A binary variable multiple regression technique utilized by Feldstein (1966) is employed to analyze the data in this study. The purpose of using this technique is to ascertain the expected increases or decreases in the dependent variables (neonatal and postneonatal mortality) in each ethnic group when adjustments are

made for various combinations of the other independent variables under study. In other words, by Using this particular analytic technique, the relationship of the ethnic groups to infant mortality may be examined in the absence of the effects of other influential factors. Since the multiple regression technique is an additive procedure, many simultaneous adjustments may be made for the effects of various factors influencing neonatal and postneonatal mortality.
In this binary variable regression method, each independent variable, instead of representing the overall effect of a factor (maternal age, for example), will represent a single subclass of a factor (for instance, maternal age 20-24), taking the value one if an observation falls into that subclass and zero otherwise. Similarly, the dependent variable will be assigned a one if the infant dies and a zero if the infant survives the first year of life. Use of this method does not require any assumptions about the forms of the relations of the dependent and independent variables. It is assumed that there is no interaction between the effects of the factors included in the equation (Suits, 1957; Shah and Abbey, 1971; Feldstein, 1966; Melichar, 1965)
The least square estimates of the regression coefficients are used for computing the percentage deviations from the expected value of the dependent variable. The deviation expressed in percentages measures the excess or deficit mortality associated with being in a particular subclass of a factor. Detailed computational procedures of adjusted percentage deviation and associated standard error have been given by Feldstein (1966).
RESULTS
Percentage deviations from the mean neonatal and postneonatal mortality rates were computed for each ethnic group. The gross effects are adjusted for various

320

combinations of the other independent variables. These unadjusted and adjusted percentage deviations can be interpreted in a similar manner as standardized rates, It should be noted that the adjustment for all factors simultaneously includes only the factors under consideration in this study. Other variables which were not taken into account may have some influence on the results.
NEONATAL MORTALITY
Among the 19S8-59 birth cohort in Houston, Texas, there were 914 neonatal deaths. Based on a total of 46,320 single births during this period, the mean neonatal mortality rate was 19.7 per

1,000. Percentage deviations are measured from this value.
Table 1shows the effects of adjustments for various combinations of factors in the study on ethnic groups, along with the approximate magnitude of standard errors. The unadjusted deviations show that Spanish surname infants and white (nonSpanish surname) infants have about the same chance of dying during the neonatal period, 12.7 and 13.8 per cent below aver-

have the highest chance, 32.3 per cent above average. However, when adjustments are made for all factors under consideration, the results are changed. Nonwhite infants have the least risk of dying,

8.4 per cent below average, while white infants now have the highest chance of mortality, 4.S per cent above average. Spanish surname infants have a percentage deviation of 2.5 per cent below average in the absence of the effects of all other factors.
When adjustments were made for only one factor, the absence of the birth weight effect caused the greatest increase in the white and Spanish surname percentage deviations. White deviations increased from 13.8 per cent below average to 0.3 per cent below average; and Spanish surname deviations increased from 12.7 per cent below average to 0.7 per cent below average. The absence of the effect of birth weight dramatically improved the nonwhite infant's chances of survival during the neonatal period, suggesting that low birth weight among nonwhite babies is mainly responsible for the excess neonatal mortality among nonwhites. Next to birth weight, legitimacy status was another influential factor associated with neonatal mortality. The absence of the effect of this factor resulted in higher risks for white and Spanish surname infants. However, both these risks remained below average. Although nonwhite infants continue to have an above-average risk of neonatal mortality in the absence of the legitimacy status effect, the unadjusted risk was reduced by 25 per cent.
The adjustment for birth order resulted in lowering the Spanish surname infants' risk of neonatal mortality to almost 14 per cent below average and the nonwhite infant risk to 30.9 per cent above average. The birth order adjustment increased the risk of white infants from 13.8 per cent below average to 12.9 per cent below average.
Mother's age was the one factor adjustment that had the least effect upon the risks of the different ethnic groups. The absence of this factor increased the risk of

white infants by approximately 4 per cent. It decreased the risk of nonwhite infants 3 per cent. The risk for Spanish surname infants stayed approximately the same after this adjustment.
As might be expected, the two-factor adjustment causing the greatest change in the unadjusted percentage deviations was the legitimacy status-birth weight combination. With this adjustment, risk of neonatal mortality for white infants increased to 1.6 per cent above average. Infants with a Spanish surname had about an average risk of death during the neonatal period when the effects of legitimacy status and birth weight were adjusted. The nonwhite deviation was reduced to 3.4 per cent below average with this adjustment.
The lowest risk obtained by the Spanish surname infants was in the absence of the effects of mother's age and birth order. The risk of Spanish surname infants, 14.6 per cent below average, was lower than both the white and the nonwhite risks.
For all three factor adjustments, Spanish surname infants had a belowaverage risk of dying during the neonatal period. However, the lowest deviation occurred in the presence of birth weight. The white risk of death during the first 27 days of life remained above average for every three-factor adjustment except the legitimacy status-mother's age-birth order adjustment. The presence of the effect of birth weight resulted in the highest risk obtained by using three-factor adjustments on the nonwhite group.
POSTNEONATAL MORTALITY
Among the 1958-59 birth cohort in Houston, Texas, there were 337 postneonatal deaths. Since the total number of births during this period was 46,320, the mean postneonatal mortality rate was 7.28 per 1,000. Percentage deviations are measured from this value. This method of

322

·Gee et al.>

computing postneonatal mortality rates is used by the National Center for Health Statistics (Grove and Hetzel, 1968). By using this particular computation, the sum of the neonatal and postneonatal mortality rates will be the infant mortality rate. It should be noted that this method fails to take into account the fact that infants whose lives end in neonatal death in reality no longer belong to the population at risk of postneonatal mortality.
Table 2 shows the effects on ethnic groups of adjustments for various combinations of factors in the study. It is noted that there are more ethnic variations in postneonatal mortality than in neonatal mortality. In general, all explanatory factors considered in this study have much

less effect on ethnic differentials in postneonatal mortality than in neonatal mortality examined above.
In the presence of all factors, nonwhite infants had the highest risk of dying of the three ethnic groups during the postneonatal period. Spanish surname infants had a 29 per cent deviation above the mean postneonatal mortality rate, while whites had the lowest risk of dying during the period, 49 per cent below average. After adjustments were made for all factors considered, nonwhites still had the highest risk and whites the lowest risk of dying after the first 27 days of life. Total adjustments did little to effect the Spanish surname risk of dying. However, in the absence of other factors in the study, the

nonwhite percentage deviation was reduced by 40 per cent--from 91 per cent above average to SS per cent above average. The risk of white infants in the absence of all other factors in the study was increased from 49.4 per cent below average to 31.4 per cent below average.
When adjustments were made for only one factor, legitimacy status seemed to be having the greatest influence on ethnic differentials. The percentage deviation of nonwhite infants dropped to 77.7 per cent above average in the absence of the effect of legitimacy status. The absence of legitimacy status caused the white infants and the Spanish surname infants to have more unfavorable percentage deviations than did the absence of any other single factor. The adjustment for mother's age seemed to have the least effect on all three ethnic groups. Of all the one-factor adjustments, the absence of the birth order effect allowed the Spanish surname group to achieve its most favorable percentage deviation of 23.2 per cent above average risk.
When adjustments for different combinations of two factors were made, more favorable percentage deviations from average risk emerged for nonwhites and Spanish surname infants. The adjustment reducing the nonwhite rate to its lowest value in the absence of two factors was for legitimacy and birth order. The interdependency of legitimacy status and birth order had a greater influence in reducing the deviation than did the interdependency of the two most important single adjustments--legitimacy and birth weight. Of all adjustments made, the adjustment causing the most reduction to the Spanish surname percentage deviation was mother's age and birth order. These same two factors were the most important single adjustments for this ethnic group. The most favorable two-factor adjustment for the white group was mother's age and

birth weight. However, this percentage deviation, 45.3 per cent below average, was higher than the unadjusted deviation of 49.4 per cent below average.
In the absence of the effects of three factors, nonwhite infants emerged with a lower percentage deviation than in the previous adjustments. This occurred when adjustments were made for all factors except birth weight. Thus, legitimacy status, mother's age, and birth order adjustments caused a greater reduction in percentage deviations than did a combination of the three most important single adjustments--legitimacy status, birth weight, and birth order. The interdependency of mother's age with birth order and legitimacy status was more important than any of the two-factor combinations of these three variables. Of all the threefactor adjustments, the adjustment of all factors except legitimacy status caused the most reduction in the Spanish surname ethnic group. This finding is not surprising, since the absence of legitimacy status caused the Spanish surname deviation to increase more than in the absence of any other factor.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
This study investigated neonatal and postneonatal mortality differentials among three ethnic groups based on infant death registration records matched with their birth registration records. Particular attention was given to the examination of changing ethnic differentials among three ethnic groups in the presence of all factors and in the absence of four sociodemographic factors. In the presence of all factors, both Spanish surname and nonSpanish white infants exhibit about a 13 per cent below average risk of neonatal mortality and the risk for nonwhites (primarily Blacks) is more than 30 per cent above the average risk.
