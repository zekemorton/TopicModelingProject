ABSTRACT: This study examines the relationship between ethnicity and fertility in Liberia, within the context of the minority group status hypothesis. The hypothesis argues that minority group status exerts an independent effect on fertility, net of controls for socioeconomic and demographic variables. Using a subsample of women from the 1974 Liberian census, the study examines interethnic variations in fertility by comparing five ethnic minorities--Bassa, Vai, Grebo, Kru, Kpelle--with the majority group, Americo-Liberian. With the possible exception of Bassa women, the findings do not support the minority group status hypothesis. Instead, the findings are more congruent with the alternative assimilationist hypothesis which argues that when sociodemographic differences between majority and minority groups are controlled, their fertility levels should converge. The implications of these findings are explored.

The purpose of this study is to exam- tains six of Liberia's ethnic groups: the

population growth rate of 3.5 per cent is very high and is typical of many SubSaharan African countries. This high rate of population growth, resulting mainly from declining mortality and prevailing high fertility, is a cause for concern, particularly in light of Liberia's continuing negative growth in GNP2.
While Bongaart et al. (1984) and Frank (1983b) have shown that nearly all of the variations in fertility in SubSaharan African can be accounted for by three proximate determinants-- namely, lactational amenorrhea, postpartum sexual abstinence, and pathological sterility--much less is known about how the institutional, cultural, and material environment impinge on these proximate determinants to influence the fertility outcomes. This study attempts to increase our understanding of how the cultural factor ethnicity (more specifically, minoritygroup status) indirectly affects fertility in Liberia. In other words, the study focuses on the institutional and cultural contexts in which reproductive behavior takes place.
Liberia provides an ideal setting for studying ethnic fertility differentials because the grossly uneven development of the country, with the coastal region much more developed than the hinterland (Liberia, 1983), means that the various ethnic groups are differentially exposed to modernizing influences such as education, urbanization, modern medicine, and Christianity. Thus, with in-
2Liberia experienced a high rate of growth in GNP between 1967 and 1970, averaging about 7 per cent per annum. This rate of growth declined to an average of 4.8 per cent between 1971 and 1974. Liberia's sensitive export-based economy suffered after 1974, registering negative GNP growth of 4.2 percent in 1975, due primarily to the recession and slow recovery in Western Europe and the United States (see RAPID, 1974).

creasing modernization, the decisions that couples make regarding the number and timing of births will depend not only on the influence that an ethnic subculture may have on them, but also on the extent of their involvement in modern institutions. Gibbs (1963) finds ethnic differences in marital instability in Liberia. Elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa, ethnic differences have been noted not only in the duration of postpartum sexual abstinence (Romaniuk, 1980; Caldwell and Caldwell, 1977) and in pathological sterility (Podlewski, 1975; Romaniuk, 1980), but also in fertility (see, for example, Gaisie, 1972; Devis, 1973; Clignet and Sween, 1978).
Clearly, a knowledge of how ethnicity/minority-group status affects fertility is important for fully understanding population dynamics and trends in Sub-Saharan African countries like Liberia. Moreover, a consideration of the magnitude, direction, and context in which ethnicity influences fertility facilitates the formulation of a population policy that is better suited to the conditions affecting the behavior of the different ethnic groups.
HISTORICAL, ETHNOGRAPHIC, AND DEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND
The modern history of Liberia began in 1821 when freed slaves from the United States, under the auspices of the American Colonization Society, landed on Providence Island in what was to become Monrovia, Liberia. Constant threats and territorial encroachments from the neighboring colonial powers-- Britain (in Sierra Leone) and France (in Guinea and Ivory Coast)--led the AfroAmerican settlers to declare Liberia an independent republic in 1847.

ple, in 1974, life expectancy at birth was 46 and 49 years for men and women, respectively; the crude birth and death rates were 49 and 16 per 1,000 population, respectively; infant mortality rates were 174 and 152 per 1,000 births for Liberian males and females, respectively; and the literacy rate was 30 and 12 per cent for men and women ten years and older, respectively (Campbell, 1982). Liberia has a young population (median age of 19.3 years) with a high total dependency ratio (806 persons supported by 1,000 workers in 1974), that is growing at an annual rate of 3.5 per cent (Conteh, 1988).

While few studies (Lee and Lee, 1959; Sly, 1970; Stahura and Stahura, 1975) provide empirical support for the assimilationist hypothesis, the majority of studies using these hypotheses provide empirical support for the minority group status hypothesis (see Goldscheider and Uhlenberg, 1969; Marshall and Sinott, 1971; Kennedy, 1973; Roberts and Lee, 1974; Bean and Wood, 1974; Ritchey, 1975; Jiobu and Marshall, 1977; Tan, 1981).

minority group women, since various indicators of modernization have been shown to depress fertility. However, findings showing that incipient modernization initially increases fertility (Nag, 1980; Romaniuk, 1980) should limit the extent to which their fertility is lower than that of minority group women. While the pronatalism/familism of minority-group women should raise their fertility above that of the majority group, the lower socioeconomic position generally expected of minority group women and the higher infant mortality and pathological sterility that such position implies should limit the extent of such fertility increase. Moreover, the prevalence of such fertilityinhibiting cultural practices as breastfeeding, postpartum abstinence, and polygyny among minority women should also work to depress their fertility below desired levels. In short, if the structural assimilation of minoritygroup women results in their abandonment or substantial relaxation of such fertility-inhibiting, cultural practices, then their fertility level should be similar to that of the Americo-Liberians. However, if the minority group women retain these cultural practices after their structural assimilation, it is likely that their fertility level will be different from and perhaps lower than that of the majority Americo-Liberians, in which case, majority and minority fertility will reflect the pattern predicted by the minority-group-status hypothesis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

native-born Liberian citizens. The dependent variable is fertility, and the independent variable is ethnicity. Education, work status, occupation, residence background, marital status, age, and age squared are used as control variables. With minor modifications, the operational definitions of the variables are as follows, based largely on the 1974 Census of Population and Housing of Liberia (1977).
The dependent variable, fertility, is measured in terms of children ever born to women ten years of age and over.
Ethnicity reflects a self-reporting of one's ethnic group. In this study, we replace the ethnic category, "No Tribal Affiliation" with Americo-Liberian, since the overwhelming majority of native-born Liberians with no tribal affiliation are Americo-Liberians. Furthermore, the term ethnicity (rather than tribe) is used in this study to reflect changes made in the 1984 census. In Liberia, ethnicity denotes a group sharing a common language, some common geographic origin, and some cultural traditions defined in general terms (see Roberts, 1964; Liebenow, 1987). Sociologically, Americo-Liberians, comprising only about 3 per cent of the population, constituted the majority group up to 1980, because they controlled a greater share of social, economic, and political power. By contrast, the various indigenous ethnic groups constituted the minority, in that they enjoyed a disproportionately smaller share of wealth, power, and prestige (see, Fraenkel, 1964; Hlope, 1979; Akpan, 1973; Liebenow, 1987).

The data for this study come from a subsample of women, aged 15 to 49 years, taken from a 10 per cent sample of the 1974 Liberian census. To control for nativity, we restrict the analysis to

Finally, in Table 3, we examine the relationship between minority group status and fertility, first for the total sample, and then for the rural and urban subsamples separately. The data in Table 3 show that for the total sample and for rural and urban women, controlling for the sociodemographic variables included in the model substantially re-

duces the small fertility differentials between the Americo-Liberians and each of the minority groups (see the unadjusted and adjusted means). In other words, among the total sample as well as among rural and urban women, the range in fertility is slightly greater in the unadjusted means (where no controls have been introduced) than in the ad-

justed means (where relevant sociodemographic variables have been controlled). The possible exception to this pattern is the fertility of Bassa women which is lower than that of the dominant group and the other minority groups, especially in the total sample and among rural women.
In short, with the possible exception of Bassa women, the small majorityminority fertility differentials can largely be accounted for by differences in the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of these women. Clearly, these findings do not provide empirical support for the minority-group-status hypothesis. On the contrary, they tend to be more consistent with the assimilationist hypothesis.
With the exception of Bassa women, there is substantial convergence in majority-minority group fertility when relevant sociodemographic variables are statistically controlled. An examination of the magnitude of the eta coefficient suggests a weak relationship between majority-minority group status (or ethnicity) and fertility in Liberia. The effect of minority group status on fertility is slightly stronger among rural women than among urban women (0.07 vs. 0.05). The model accounts for a modest percentage (34 per cent) of the variance in the dependent variable, fertility, and these findings are statistically significant at the 0.05 level of significance or lower.
These findings may be interpreted as suggesting that with respect to fertility behavior in the groups under study, the structural assimilation of minority groups seems to result in their cultural assimilation vis-a-vis the majority Americo-Liberians. Although this study lacks data on breastfeeding and postpartum abstinence, it seems reasonable to
