ABSTRACT:Alcoholism has been described as a behavioral condition comprised of symptoms of alcohol dependence and the psycho-socio-biologic consequences of chronic alcohol dependence. Progress in clarifying the role of genetic factors in explaining differences in onset of dependence upon alcohol, frequency of consequences of chronic alcohol use, and transmission of patterns of alcoholism within a family pedigree has been based upon use of diagnostic methods that reliably and validly separate alcohol dependence from alcohol abuse. Twin methods, which control for genotypic variation, and adoption studies, which control for differences in rearing, have provided significant support for a genetic vulnerability hypothesis for development of alcoholism and a genetic heterogeneity hypothesis for type of alcoholism. The author reviews data from basic and clinical investigation of two subtypes of alcoholism: one associated with antisocial personality, and one that is "familial" (family-history-positive alcoholism). Significant differences in onset and clinical course for these subtypes suggest that differential plans for matching treatment to the individual alcoholic may be warranted.

heavy alcohol use and the attainment of a series of medical, legal, social, and/or family complications and symptoms of withdrawal and tolerance to alcohol. Specifically, the Feighner classification defines a person as "alcoholic" if ever he or she has drunk alcohol daily for at least one year and has taken six or more drinks at least two or three times a month; or has drunk six or more drinks at least one time a week for more than one year (heavy drinking) and in addition has developed problems from drinking in at least threeof four groups: (1) social disapproval by friends, parents; marital problems; (2) job trouble, traffic arrests, other police trouble; (3) frequent blackouts, tremor, withdrawal

The most recent attempts to provide reliable and valid means of clinically separating alcohol abuse from alcohol dependence have resulted in the DSMIII diagnostic criteria (DSM-III, 1980). The DSM-III diagnosis of alcohol dependence requires either a pattern of pathological alcohol use (inability to stop, binges, blackouts) or impairment of social or occupational functioning and either development of tolerance (to increasing amounts of alcohol) or withdrawal symptoms after drinking. Thus, as in the Feighner criteria, psychosocial consequences are used in the DSM-III assessment of alcohol dependence. Hence alcohol dependence can be viewed solely in terms of physical de-

pendence symptoms of pathological use, tolerance, and withdrawal, or it may include those symptoms plus the range of psychosocial consequences so long associated with the sociopathy of alcoholism. In this review, attention will be directed toward efforts to assess the role of antisocial personality or sociopathy when evaluating the psychosocial consequences of the alcoholism syndrome. Social disruption may be secondary to the effects on personality of chronic alcohol dependence. On the other hand, psychosocial complications of alcohol dependence may arise from antisocial personality behavioral factors that precede the dependent state but nevertheless are part of the development of dependence on alcohol.

Alcoholism associated with antisocial personality has appeared in differing fashions in three adoption studies of alcoholism. In their Swedish adoption study of alcoholism, Cloninger et al. (1981) characterized their adopted alcoholics as: (1) Type I (13 per cent), those with a significant but weak genetic vulnerability for alcoholism; and (2) Type II (4 per cent), those with a criminal alcoholic biologic father and a ninefold increase in risk for alcoholism. The Type II alcoholic male of the Swedish adoption study may be what others have described as the male ASP alcoholic. Similarly, the Danish adoption study demonstrated an excess of antisocial behavior in childhood in one sample of adopted male alcoholics (Goodwin et

that there is an equal frequency of alcoholism in first- and second-degree relatives of male and female alcoholics (Winokur et al., 1970; Cotton, 1979; Stabenau and Hesselbrock, 1980,1983; Hall et al., 1983a). Genetic transmission continues through those women whether they drink sufficient amounts of alcohol to become dependent or not. In order to compare men and women, some selected drinking behaviors and physical consequences of alcohol dependence are shown in Table 4. These data demonstrate that men drink earlier; drink more heavily; enter the later stages of addiction at an earlier age; and develop more fatty liver, ischmie heart disease, and gastritis than do women alcoholics (Glatt, 1961; Haglund and

Clinical issues such as the age at the various stages of dependence, the quantity and frequency of alcohol use, and the occurrence of psychological and/or physical impairment subsequent to chronic alcohol use were considered in the UCHC sample. A detailed alcohol drinking and drug use history, a standardized psychiatric interview using the NIMH Diagnostic Interview Schedule (DIS), and the Family History Research Diagnostic Criteria (FHRDC) were utilized. The latter measured family alcohol use and psychopathology. The methods have been described elsewhere (M. Hesselbrock et al., 1983).

There have been two studies of children at risk for alcoholism (biologic relatives with alcoholism) that measured acetaldehyde after ethanol ingestion. One showed elevation of blood acetaldehyde in family-positive subjects as compared to family-negative subjects (Schuckit and Rayses, 1979). The other showed no significant differences in either blood or breath acetaldehyde levels between children with or without relatives who were alcoholic (Behar et al., 1983). One possible reason for this discrepancy is that Schuckit's sample was older and had used alcohol socially. Alcohol use may induce a different enzy-

(1982) found that male but not female 11- to 13year-old children at risk for alcoholism showed an excess of fast beta EEG activity. Propping et al. (1981), on the other hand, reported patterns of poorly synchronized EEG wave forms in adult female alcoholics with reduction of alpha and preponderance of beta activity and significantly similar patterns in their relatives; however, this EEG pattern was not observed in male alcoholics or their relatives.

lution of the DSM I, II, and III criteria for alcoholism diagnosis. The successive schema have involved inclusion, exclusion, and then partial inclusion of sociopathic and antisocial behavior in the labeling of alcoholism. Schuckit (1973) drew attention to the need to separate sociopathy and alcoholism diagnosis, but was also one of the first to show the role that ASP played in the early onset of alcohol dependence in men and women (Schuckit et al., 1969; Schuckit et al., 1970).
If one conceptualizes alcoholism not as a unitary disorder but as one with multifactorial determinants, several of which may be genetic, efforts should be made to trace the similarities and the differences in the pathways to alcohol dependence. In the UCHC sample, two significant pathways have emerged: one associated with ASP, and one that is "familial" (family-history-positive alcoholism).
To become dependent upon alcohol there must be a choice to drink alcohol rather than not to drink alcohol. The multivariate approach to alcohol dependence has suggested at least four rein-

forcement contingencies for alcohol use or avoidance of alcohol use and subsequent dependence (Caddy, 1977). Table 13 lists positive biologic reinforcers for alcohol use such as "enjoyed the taste" or "to help one sleep" and positive psychosocial reinforcers for alcohol use such as "just to be sociable" or "to relieve boredom." Negative biologic reinforcers and negative psychosocial re-

inforcers that might reduce alcohol use cover items from "I don't like the effect it produces" to "my parents disapprove" (see Table 14). Subjects in the UCHC prospective study sample rated these items in themselves as reasons for drinking and not drinking. The importance of reinforcement contingencies is exemplified in the study by Goedde et al. (1979). Goedde (1978) demonstrated that a series of negative biologic reinforcers appeared principally in "Mongoloids" as compared to "Caucasoids" in response to alcohol use (see Table 15). The author suggests that the increased frequency of the symptoms such as tachycardia, palpitations, and "hot in stomach" experienced in response to alcohol consumption by "Mongoloid" subjects may account for reduced alcohol use and subsequently reduced frequencies of alcoholism in Oriental populations. Clinically, more females than males describe alcohol "sensitivity" sensations. Reed (this volume) has not described sex differences in the ALDH

isozyme studies he reviewed, presumably because these isozymes are autosomally determined. Female "sensitivity," if such is clearly established, may derive from another source.
Thus, genetic heterogeneity (isozymes and polymorphisms) may contribute to a variety of individually different isozyme phenotypes for the degradation of acetaldehyde. These factors, through acetaldehyde-related symptoms, may be potent inhibitors of the use of alcohol in such variant populations and should be studied in low-risk, nonalcohol-using subjects and in highrisk family history positives and ASPdisorder individuals.
In the UCHC high-risk and low-risk subsamples, for those subjects without alcohol dependence diagnosis, the number of times getting drunk was highly correlated with ounces of alcohol consumed in the six months before the study period. Subjects with either father or mother alcoholic or both parents alcoholic had significantly more often drunk to drunkenness (X= 2.3) as com-

A Danish study of 50 criminals with alcoholism and ASP and a control group of 42 male non-ASP criminal alcoholics demonstrated significantly less physical dependence and fewer medical complications among alcoholics with ASP during a time at which alcohol was readily available (Virkkunen, 1979). In an 8-year follow-up study of 93 unequivocal alcoholic felons, 40 per cent were in remission and all but two without psychiatric treatment. Seventy per cent of those alcoholics had a sociopathic diagnosis in addition to alcoholism (Goodwin et al., 1971). Other investigators have noted that ASP behaviors, if not terminated by death or incarceration, often decreased in intensity by age 30 or 40 (Robins, 1966; Vaillant, 1982).
As most studies suggest that men and women alcoholics do not enter treatment until the third decade of life, preventive intervention in alcoholism must come early and must precede formal treatment. The need for early intervention is further illustrated by the fact that 50,000 Americans are killed each year in alcohol-related motor vehicle accidents. At the rate of 10,000 young people per year, that form of casualty is the leading cause of death in the 15-24 age group (Mayer, 1983). Treatment interventions, in the main, have not been targeted at subtypologies of alcoholics (primary vs. secondary, ASP vs. non-ASP, early onset vs. late onset, CNS-impaired vs. nonimpaired). The range of treat-

ment interventions made available to the undifferentiated alcoholic, as reviewed in a recent federal report, are listed in Table 16 (5th Report ADAMHA, 1983c).
Future treatment programs need to match the clients' needs, capabilities, and deficits with the type of treatment. As an example, Mandell (1981) has described a series of approaches to the specific treatment of alcoholism in sociopathy. The author suggests that the "primary sociopath" subtype often enters treatment through intervention by a spouse, an employer, or the law. These individuals respond to cognitive treatment that focuses on how alcohol interferes with the subject's own goals and ambitions. "Hysteroid" or "neurotic" sociopaths enter treatment because of physical illness or fear of insanity in the form of explosive episodes of violence.

These individuals often respond to training in management of emotional upset, especially anger. Their verbal facility is regarded as a hindrance in this process. "Inadequate" or "cultural" sociopaths enter treatment because of exhaustion of resources. They most often respond through attachment to nondrinking peer groups and training in lifecoping skills. AA is of particular help to this group (Mandell, 1981).
SUMMARY
Selected studies and reports have been reviewed. Data drawn from the UCHC "typology" study sample and from the UCHC "prospective" study sample have been presented. The latter serve only as guidelines in the description of the natural history of alcoholism. It is not clear how generalizable results from volunteer inpatients and outpatients may be in application to the understanding of alcoholism as it exists for those who are dependent upon alcohol but never attain formal ascertainment through any form of treatment. From these data, some limited statement about putative genetic factors has been proposed to promote further etiologic study and to suggest items for structuring therapeutic programs. Such programs might provide more optimal matches of patients' alcohol-related disabilities and vulnerabilities with specific environmental and biologic treatments.
The following conclusions are principally derived from the UCHC typology study. Three independent genetically transmitted factors--sex, family history of alcoholism, and antisocial personality--appeared to contribute to the pathogenesis of alcoholism and support a genetic heterogeneity hypothesis. The

type of family history of alcoholism did not appear to be related to the natural course of alcoholism in males or females. Specifically, alcoholics without alcoholism on either side of the family (FHN) and probands with alcoholism on only one side of the family (FHPU) did not differ in terms of their natural history of the course of alcoholism or in terms of the consequences of chronic alcohol use. However, when compared to FHN and FHPU probands, alcoholics with alcoholism on both sides of the family pedigree (FHPB) experienced significantly greater impaired control over drinking behavior and psychological problems associated with chronic alcohol use. Antisocial personality diagnosis was significantly associated with an earlier onset of the first stages of alcohol abuse and greater frequency of psychosocial problems associated with chronic alcohol use as compared to non-ASP alcoholics.
Females began the early stages of alcohol use at an older age than did males, but they reached the later stages of alcohol addiction at about the same time. The age of first treatment for alcoholism, however, does not appear to be significantly influenced by sex of the subject or by family history or diagnosis of ASP. Sex of the proband, presence of ASP, and type of family pedigree for alcoholism have not been found to be interactive but appear to contribute separate additive effects to the development of alcohol dependence.
