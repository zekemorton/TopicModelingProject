ABSTRACT: Desired family size and contraceptive behavior of 986 ever-married women aged 15-54 from Northern Mindanao, the Philippines, are described. Using the Dow and Werner typology of demographic and contraceptive patterns, it was found that a majority of the women were traditional in their demographic attitude and contraceptive behavior. A substantial proportion of the women desired medium to large families. Inconsistency in attitude and behavior was also manifested by women who desired small families but have never used efficient family planning methods. Sociodemographic characteristics of these women are described. A majority of the women who have never used efficient contraception also never practiced family planning. Rhythm was the primary method of birth control among demographic innovators and traditionals who have ever used inefficient methods; the pill was popular among contraceptive innovators and the moderns. A considerable proportion of the demographic innovators and the traditionals were not currently using any family planning method; a lesser proportion of contraceptive innovators and moderns were also not using birth control methods. Relevance of the findings to family planning programs is pointed out. Recommendations are given.

The inconsistency between attitude and behavior has been well documented (Liska, 1975). Various studies in fertility and family planning have shown how inconsistency is manifested in the incongruency between expressed desired family size and contraceptive use (Freedman and Coombs, 1974; Poffenberger, 1968; Stycos and Back, 1964; Hill et al., 1959;Figa-Talamanca, 1972). Consistent with the findings of studies on desired family size and contraceptive use, the 1977 Republic of the Philippines Fertility Survey reported that not only do Filipino women show a distinct preference for small families, they also exhibit an extensive knowledge about contraception. However, the same survey reported only modest use of efficient contraception among Filipino women. Only a quarter of the women had ever

tried the pill and one in fourteen had used an IUD (Concepcion, 1980). The 1976 National Acceptor Survey (NAS) revealed that of the acceptors who had terminated contraceptive use within one year after acceptance of any method, only 8.0 per cent discontinued use in order to have another child. About 4.0 per cent said they had discontinued use because they no longer needed contraception (e.g., menopause) and 11.0 per cent ceased contraceptive use because they became pregnant (Laing, 1977). Thus, while a considerable proportion of Filipino women reported that they did not want additional children, this desire was not implemented in terms of family planning practice, particularly the useof efficient contraception (Palmore and Concepcion, 1981;Concepcion, 1980).
In order to assess the demographic

and contraceptive patterns of a sample of Filipino women from NorthernMindanao, the Dowand Werner (1982) typology of contraceptive andfertility behavior was utilized. Efficient contraceptive use and desired family size were cross-classified along these dimensions, resulting in thefollowing categories: (1) moderns or the demographic and contraceptive innovators, (2) transitionals composed of the demographic but not contraceptive innovators,1 and (3) transitionals who were contraceptive but not demographic innovators,2 and (4) traditionals or the noninnovators.
The measures of efficient useof contraception were similar to those of Dow and Werner.3 However, desired family size was measured using the Coombs Number Preference Scale (Coombs,
1Demographic but not contraceptive innovators are referred to as demographic innovators throughout the article.
2Contraceptive but not demographic innovators are identified as contraceptive innovators throughout the article.
3The following methods were defined as efficient: pill, IUD, condom, female andmale sterilization, and injection. Douche, rhythm, withdrawal, abstinence, foam, massage, and drinking herbs were defined as inefficient.

1974, 1976; Coombs et al., 1975). This scale wasconsidered to be an improvement over the usual measure of desired family size inthat the number scale measured therespondent's priorities or bias toward a larger or smaller family size. The respondent was given second, third, or fourth choices beyond the first preference. Whether a respondent chose a number that was greater or smaller than her first choice would indicate how her priorities regarding family size were ordered and which way shewould tend to "lean" if she didnot getherfirstchoice. Thus, an individual's response to questions about family size might be a point on acontinuum of acceptable number of children, as opposed to thediscreteand fixedmeasure of desired family size often used in surveys. Location at the lower end of the scale (IN-1-3) indicated anunderlying preference forsmall families, while an IN-4 meant a biastoward medium-sized families, andan IN5-7 indicated a preference for larger families (Coombs, 1979). For typological purposes, underlying number preferences was categorized into preference for small families and preference formedium to large families.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
During the months of May, June, and July, 1980, a randomly selected sample of 986 women wasintervewed. Included were ever-married women aged 15-54 who had at least one pregnancy. Table 1 shows selected socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the sample as a whole. A majority of the women (94.5 per cent) were married at the time of the interview; 3.8 per cent were widowed, and 1.7 per cent were separated.

The median agewas34.96 years. On the average, the women had been married for twelve years. As an indication of the stability of marriage, 95.5 per cent of the women had been married only once.
About half of the women (49.9 per cent) had one to four pregnancies; 32.5 per cent reported five to eight pregnancies; 13.3 per cent had nine to twelve; and 4.3per cent had been pregnant 13to 18 times.
Less than half (47.7per cent) resided in households where the average monthly income was under 500 pesos (one dollar = 7.5 pesos). About 35 per cent lived in households where income was from 500 pesos to 999 pesos, and 17.5 per cent in households where income was 1,000 pesos or over.

cent vs. 8 per cent), the present study shows more contraceptive innovators (26.5 per cent) than demographic innovators (8.3 per cent) among women in the Northern Mindanao region of the Philippines. This finding seems to indicate that a substantial percentage of women in Northern Mindanao use efficient contraception at some point in their lives while still desiring larger families.
Although it was expected that a larger proportion of women would be categorized under Box B, the finding in this study shows women in Northern Mindanao to be more traditional than women in other parts of Asia. Efficient contraception may have been used for spacing purposes rather than to stop reproduction altogether. This finding is consistent with the demographic behav-

ior of Cebuano women (Yu and Liu, 1980). The proportion of women (8.3 per cent) in the present study who wanted small families but had never used efficient contraception suggest a need for family planning programs that promote effective methods of birth planning.
CHARACTERISTICS OF INNOVATORS AND

Age.--As might be expected, more women over 35 years of age (70.3 per cent) were traditional in their demographic attitude and contraceptive behavior. However, 66.9 per cent of those less than 25years of age were also noninnovators, while about 48.9 per cent of women 25 to 34 years of age were in this category.

were under 25 years of age, while women 25-35 years of age formed the greatest percentage (37.4 per cent) of contraceptive innovators. More women under 25 years of age, compared to the other age groups, were modern in their contraceptive and demographic behavior.
Education.--As expected, women who had attended college were more likely to be modern in their demographic attitude and contraceptive behavior, compared to those who attended only high school or elementary school, or who received no formal education. Also, more contraceptive innovators were found among collegeeducated women (31.3 per cent). As expected, the greatest percentage of women who desired medium to large families and never used contraception were found among women who had no formal education or had only elementary education.

Residence and Socioeconomic Status.--The Northern Mindanao region was divided into three types of area: urban, semi-urban, and rural.4 Socioeconomic status (Madigan, n.d.) indicates whether a woman lived in a lower-class household, or a middle- or upper-class household. Table 2 shows the distribution of women by residence and socioeconomic status. Because of the few cases found among the moderns and demographic innovators, comparison will be made among contraceptive innovators and traditionals according to SES and residence.
When SES was held constant, poor women in semi-urban areas were found to be more likely to become innovators than were poor rural women with 28.7
4Residence was designated by the type of sample area the respondent resided in. An area was considered urban if it was part of a chartered city; semi-urban areas consisted of municipal poblaciones (town proper); and the rest of the sample area was considered rural.

per cent vs. 13.5 percent). Only 10.8 per cent of the traditionals resort to rhythm as a family planning method, while the corresponding percentage for contraceptive innovators was 6.3 per cent.
Possible explanations for the shift from efficient methods to rhythm among modern and contraceptive innovators were the fear of possible sideeffects of the more efficient methods and expenditures related to the pill and other efficient methods (Yu and Liu, 1980).
FERTILITY LEVEL
In order to have a complete picture of the demographic and contraceptive behavior of the women in the sample, total number of live births by type of respondents is reported in Table 6. Figures adjusted for age show that of the four types of respondents, the demographic innovators appeared to have the fewest live births; 56.4 per cent of the demographic

innovators reported two live births or less. A greater proportion of contraceptive innovators had more than two live births, compared to the three other types of respondents in the sample.
The findings depicted in Table 6 indicate the importance of the underlying preference for small families. Women who prefer small families--modern and demographic innovators--were more likely to have low fertility than women who prefer medium to large families. While it was expected that traditional women were more likely to have higher fertility than others, the finding regarding contraceptive innovators was unexpected. Efficient use of contraception without the desire for small families will not be enough to bring down fertility levels. This underscores the importance of motivation to have small families in order to have a successful family planning program. Innundation of efficient methods (Ravenholt and Chao, 1974) may not be sufficient since a shift to inefficient methods of or nonpractice of family planning may take place which could result in unwanted or unplanned births. However, the possibility of efficient contraception use for spacing purposes in order to achieve traditional family size can not be discounted.

GENDER PREFERENCE
It has been reported that demographic and contraceptive behavior was highly affected by the desired family sex composition (Williamson, 1976; Coombs, 1977). Until the desired number of boys and girls has been achieved, a couple may postpone the use of an efficient contraceptive method.
Underlying sex preference for offspring was measured using the Coombs Sex Preference Scale (Coombs et al.,

Data presented inTable 7suggestan overall underlying preference forfemale offspring among women inNorthern Mindanao. Women in allfour categories showed a strong underlying preference for girls: 58.8 percent ofthe moderns, 41.7 per cent ofthe contraceptive innovators, 47.9 percent of thedemographic innovators, and 44.9 per cent of the noninnovators. A balanced number of male and female children found least acceptance among moderns(13.3

Because a desire for small families, coupled with theuse of inefficient contraception, will ultimately lead to unwanted births, it was deemed worthwhile to investigate demographic and contraceptive behavior anditsrelationship with unwanted births.
Unwanted birth was measured by asking themother to indicate whichof her pregnancies she had notwanted at all or would have preferred later.The former is referred to as "number failures" andthelatter as "timing failures"

(Jaffe, 1971). Both types of failuresare

used efficient contraception tended to admit having unwanted birth. About 41.7 per cent of the contraceptive innovators and 39.3 per cent of the moderns had unwanted births, compared to20.9 per cent among demographic innovators and 24.0per cent among traditionals. Thus, while demographic innovators wanted small families, only about 21.0 per cent admitted having an unwanted birth. Less than a quarter of the traditionals were in this category.
DISCUSSION
Analysis of the desired family size and contraceptive behavior of a sample of women in Northern Mindanao shows that contraceptive innovators had more live births than demographic innovators, the moderns, and the traditionals. While it seems possible that contraceptive innovators use efficient contraception as a spacing tool until the desired family size was obtained, the possibility that women use efficient contraception after they have more children than they want should also be taken into account (Kiesler, 1977). However, it should be emphasized that a majority of the women were noninnovators (62.1 per cent), and this indicates a lack of motivation for small family size. As pointed out by Potts and Selman (1979), motivation for small family is a prerequisite for a successful family planning program. Without motivation, what family planning programs do is reduce the number

of unwanted births. While this is a worthwhile cause in itself, fertility will continue to be high in the absence of this motivation for a smaller family size.
Lest it be forgotten, family planning programs should also reach out to those who are sufficiently motivated to have small families but have not ever used efficient contraception. Equally important is the task of motivating and introducing the traditional women to the idea of the feasibility of family limitation.
One of the findings of this research is that a majority of the women who never used efficient contraception also never used inefficient or traditional methods. Efforts should be made to change this. In addition, more efforts should be made to bring those modern and contraceptive innovators who had stopped using any family planning method to practice contraception again. Explanation as to the possible side-effects of the more efficient methods should be given to fearful acceptors and terminators. If rhythm was preferred, more efficient ways of practicing rhythm should be discussed with both husband and wife.
