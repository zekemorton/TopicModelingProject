Most of the many early anthropologic studies of Hindu society were done in North Indian villages where strong taboos exist against inbreeding. Therefore, the prevailing concept of Indian marriage patterns is that of carefully arranged marriages which rule out consanguinity. Only a few more recent reports have focused special attention on the consanguineous marriage patterns of South India (Dronamraju and Khan, 1963; Sivertsen, 1963; Centerwall and Centerwall, 1966; Sanghvi, 1966). It is interesting that many North Indian doctors and others of the scientific community in that country do not know that the southern customs are so different and tend to view reports of such frequent and close inbreeding with amazement, if not disbelief.
Routine family histories of sick children brought to the Christian Medical College in Vellore, South India, revealed that close consanguineous marriage was indeed the custom of these families. The first investigation of consanguinity which was done at

that hospital was a study of the relationship of consanguinity to congenital defects in children seen in the pediatric outpatient clinic and in the newborn nursery (Centerwall and Centerwall, 1966). The amount of close consanguinity among the parents of 3,433 outpatient cases and 1,037 newborn babies studied was unexpectedly high, being approximately 45% and 37%, respectively, of these parents.
Several circumstances of the first study led the authors to the study which is reported here. The population in the first study was self-selected by coming to the hospital for medical care. Secondly, the marriage relationships had been recorded according to the parent's report without taking family pedigrees. Thirdly, the amount of consanguinity which we reported was regarded with both interest and skepticism. Therefore, we decided to do careful pedigrees of a representative sample of families in a "typical" South Indian village for the purpose of reporting accurately themarriage customs of such a group. To our knowledge, no comparable study exists.
The village of Kavanur was chosen because of the comprehensive rural health program already established there by the De-

partment of Community Health of the Christian Medical College in Vellore. A resident doctor with an intern assistant, a pharmacist, and a group of public health nurses staff a small hospital and an outpatient service. The nurses deliver almost all the babies in the area, which is a measure of the good rapport they have with the families.
Kavanur is situated about fifteen miles northwest of Vellore (see Fig. 1). It is two miles off the main road between Katpadi and Gudiyattam, near the border between the states of Madras and Andhra. It is an independent, agricultural community, typical of the villages in which the majority of the people of Madras State live. Crops can

be raised throughout the year, including rice, peanuts, bananas, and sugar cane. Most of the people either work their own land, rent land, or are wage-laborers. There are a few shopkeepers. All people of the village speak Tamil, the indigenous Dravidian language of Madras State. In addition, a fair-sized minority can handle Telegu, a sister Dravidian tongue of the nearby state of Andhra Pradesh. The small Muslim group also are fluent in Urdu (essentially the same as spoken Hindustani, but with a Persian script), the language of the followers of Mohammed throughout South Asia. A few well-educated men have a command of English, but in no family is it the household

language. While the facts of Kavanur do not fit all peoples and situations in South India, we feel that this village is, by geographical location, cultural patterns, size and composition, almost a classic model of a rural, Dravidian, South Indian village.
METHOD OF STUDY
Each household was visited by a team of two Indian doctors who were doing the Community Health portion of their internship. At least one member of each pair was a female and at least one was fluent in the local language, Tamil. The other team member was conversant with Tamil and served as the recorder. The interviewers had been instructed in the art of pedigree-taking, and preliminary trial interviews were done under the supervision of the main author. Most pedigrees linked together several households and information was obtained from more than one informant. However, when one informant seemed to have accurate information about an adjacent household of a close relative, no check was made of the information unless there was a point in doubt. The time spent with each informant varied considerably, but averaged about an hour.
Various pitfalls in determining consanguineous relationships had been discovered in earlier pedigree work in the same geographic area. A confusion of affinal (in-law) relationships with blood relationships occurred occasionally when there were several links with another family. In such cases it seemed probable that there had been a blood relationship at some time in the past. The lack of near relationship was revealed by plotting the pedigree as it was taken. Even when an informant was quite certain that a specific marriage was between blood relatives but was unable to describe exactly the nature of the relationship, such marriages, though marked in a special way in the pedigree, were not included in the data.
Most confusing were the South Indian

peculiarities of naming of relatives. A "brother" might mean a true brother or a "cousin-brother" (actually the father's brother's child, a first cousin). Similarly, a "niece" might mean the sister's daughter or it could mean the "cousin-brother's" daughter (actually a first cousin once removed). The method used for checking on the actual relationship was to include all the names when taking and plotting the original pedigree.
DATA AND RESULTS
At the time of this study there were a total of 1,447 people living in 321 households (an average of 4.5 persons per house). Twenty-four family pedigrees were obtained involving 12 castes1 and 117 houses (see Fig. 2). Table 1 gives the total number of households in each caste and the number and per cent that were included in the pedigrees obtained. An attempt was made to include families from all castes living in the village. This resulted in a total or near-total sampling of some caste groups with minimal representation in the village, such as the Brahmins, Dhobies, and Muslims, and a considerably lesser proportion of certain larger caste groups such as the Harijans and Naickers (see Table 1). Those homes without an adult informant available were bypassed, but only 21 households were left unidentified as to caste.
The Brahmin, represented by only one household in the village, was by tradition the most prestigious member of Hindu society. He was a landlord as well as the authority on ritual. Those who were virtually his social equal were the other landowners, the Veerasivams, Mudaliars, and Chettiars. The headman of the village was a Chettiar. The more typical peasant members of the

society were the tenant fanners: the Acharies, Naickers, and Nadars. The Dhobies were the washermen. Some of the Harijans, former Untouchables, worked small plots of rented land, but usually they were day laborers, cobblers, or did other menial tasks for the upper-caste families.
Figure 3 shows an example of a fairly typical pedigree in the village. In all, 871 marriages were plotted in the 24 family pedigrees. As the study progressed, it be-

* When members of a household knowledgeably included in their family pedigree members of other households in the village, such other households were considered as having been included in the survey. However, the only marriages included in the final consanguinity analysis were those of the informants and children of informants.

came apparent that when informants did not know the exact consanguineous relationship of a marriage, they often would say that there was no such relationship rather than admit they did not know--even though answers of doubt were perfectly acceptable to the interviewers (though such marriages were not included in the final calculations). This fact was borne out in later analyses of the pedigrees where the rate of consanguinity was found to decrease as the informant described the marriages of more distant relatives. Even the marriages of the informants' siblings and parents were recorded

with one-third and two-thirds lower consanguinity rates respectively than those of the informants themselves or of their own children (whose marriages they customarily arrange). Therefore, for the final analyses of consanguinity rates and coefficients of inbreeding, only 92 marriages were used, i.e., the 47 marriages of informants (pedigree sources) and the 45 (arranged) marriages of their children, because only information on these marriages was considered of maximum reliability.
The coefficient of inbreeding of a particular mating is the chance that both parties carry a specific gene from a common ancestor, e.g., for first cousin mating it is 1/16 or 0.062S. Table 2 lists "coefficient of inbreeding" values and symbols for the different types of consanguineous unions. Table 3 includes a "gross" breakdown of the 92 marriages by type and frequency. Nearly half (47.8%) of the marriages were between relatives, with more than 10% of all marriages taking place between a man and his sister's daughter. These consanguineous couples often are even more closely inbred than the table implies. A complex network of inbreeding means that frequently several relationships exist simultaneously in the same marriage. For example, in the Naicker pedigree portrayed in Figures 3 and 4, the "uncle-niece" marriage involving the son of one of the informants is not only "uncleniece" but also a 2\ cousin (called second cousin once removed) and also a 3 | cousin (or third cousin once removed) marriage. This sort of close inbreeding yields an exceptionally high inbreeding coefficient of 0.0351 for the 92 marriages.
In Figure 4 the pedigrees of the village have been skeletonized or reduced in order to demonstrate easily the nature and complexity of the consanguinity involved in these 92 marriages. Table 4 puts values on these 44 consanguineous unions with development of consanguinity rates and coefficients of inbreeding. The significance of this

FIG. 2.--In this survey, 24 family pedigrees were taken, involving 117 of the321 village households(see Table 1).Families of thesame cast tend to live close together; so, in most instances, thecastes of theblank "not surveyed" households are the same as for nearby identified ones. Surrounding the village are rice paddies with some acreage put into sugar cane and groundnut (peanut) production. Within a one and a half mile radius of Kavanur are four similar but somewhat smaller villages, and four or five miles away is a larger town with movie theater and bazaar.

* The above table is based on the single closest relationship for each consanguineous union. This simplified categorization is overly conservative in that inbreeding often is recorded through several generations. This means that many of the consanguineous marriages are more complex and thus more closely inbred than the simple listing of uncle-niece or first cousin, and the like, indicates.

If, in an hypothetical population, all marriages in a particular generation are between first cousins, the inbreeding coefficient will be 0.0625. If all marriages are between first cousins onceremoved (1J cousins), the coefficient of inbreeding will be 0.0313.

because of the small size of the study. However, a grouping of the highest (socioeconomic and educational) Hindu castes shows a significantly lower rate of consanguinity (averaging 25.8%) as compared to middle and lower-level castes and to non-Hindus who range between 56.0 and 61.3%. The village sample included 70.6% of the higher castes (Brahmin, Veerasivan, Chettiar, and Mudaliar) who constitute only 11.0% of the total population and 31.7% of the re-

mainder who constitute 89.0% of the village population.
DISCUSSION
The Hindu caste system of India has probably been the subject of more study and speculation than any other social stratification system in the world (Ketkar, 1909; Kapadia, 1947; Ghurye, 1957; Leach, 1960; Majumdar, 1961; Zinkin, 1962; Sivertsen, 1963). Whether this stratification of society

However, this is not in the order of contribution to the population inbreeding coefficient which also depends on the number of marriagesof each type. See Table 2 for the meaning of the symbols.
t The total inbreeding coefficients are summations of the coefficients contributed by specific types of consanguineous marriages, for example, 6.5% of the total marriages are simple uncle-niece (UN) unions with a coefficient contribution of 0.065 X 0.1250 (see Table 2).

their position as political and religious leaders. It eventually permeated all of Indian life, dividing the society into smaller and smaller social groups, but making each group dependent on the structure of the whole. It divided conqueror from conquered, Aryan from Dravidian, landowner from laborer, warrior from craftsman, priest from pilgrim. Small facets of life might change, the surface of society might be ruffled, but the concept of "dharma," as the life to

A caste is, therefore, by definition, endogamous. Blood relatives and families who can intermarry are of the same caste. A study of marriage customs in India is not a study of relationships between castes but of the practices within the caste groups. When an Indian thinks of his caste, he thinks of the people to whom he is related or might become related by marriage. In this sense,

the caste is like a clan. The degree of interrelationship differs markedly throughout the country. In the South, the marriage customs are patterned after those of the original Indians, or Dravidians, who were pushed to the south, and are characterized by marriage between close relatives. In the North there are rules that prevent such marriages. The origin of these rules of exogamy in the North is not known. It is commonly stated that Hindus of the North cannot marry anyone who is related to them within five or even seven generations, and often that they cannot marry within their own village. For all intents, one may assume that there is no consanguinity among most northern Hindus.
Such rules of exogamy (as in North India) have apparently had little effect on the traditional customs in the Dravidian South. The rules of caste are as firmly, if not more firmly, established than in the North. Perhaps the sizes of the castes are smaller, making marriage choices more limited; and this may have helped to perpetuate the ancient pattern of consanguineous marriage. In most Hindu communities of the South a first cousin marriage is a preferred union, and in some it is the reserved right of the younger brother to marry the older sister's daughter (uncle-niece marriage). This marriage pattern has been explained as the traditional way of seeing that property that went to an elder sister by ancient matrilineal custom actually passed on to her brother.
In other ways, however, the Hindu communities of South India today have a typical, extended, patrilineal-patrilocal structure, and marriage patterns observe the significance of this joint-family setting. This means that a man and his brother with their wives and children live together under the father's roof or in adjacent households. The brothers are all "fathers" to the children and the children are all "brothers and sisters" to each other. The children will call

their father's older brother, "big father," and his younger brother, "little father." None of the people in this group will marry each other. But the brother's sisters will be living in various other households, often in different villages. Compared with the close feeling that the members of one household have for each other, these aunts and their children do not seem so closely related. The father's sister is called "aunt" and the mother's brother is called "uncle." Figure 5 shows examples of the kinds of consanguineous marriages which are common and acceptable.
SUMMARY
A representative village population of rural South India was determined to have an exceptionally high consanguinity rate of 47.8% and a coefficient of inbreeding of 0.0351. This is a conservative estimate, both because of the strictness of criteria requiring informant's knowledge as to the exact "blood relationship" involved and because sample bias includes a greater proportion of the less-numerous, less-consanguineous, upper castes.
There is reason to believe from other studies (Dronamraju and Khan, 1963; Centerwall and Centerwall, 1966; Sanghvi, 1966) that a high rate of inbreeding exists throughout most of Dravidian South India with a population in excess of 110 million. This area thus provides an exceptional opportunity for studying the biological effects of consanguinity in populations and also the occurrence in specific families of congenital deformities, miscarriages, still births, postnatal mortality, and fertility. It may be possible to learn more about the genetic role (or lack thereof) in specific, heretofore puzzling disorders. For example, if the parents of a collection of persons with disease " X " are found to have a much higher rate of inbreeding than do those of a control group or the general population from which the cases are obtained, this would sug-

gest that hereditary factors are involved to some degree in the production of that disease.
Finally, knowledge of the high inbreeding rate in South India is valuable, in a practical way, for genetic counseling. In India, most marriages are still arranged by the parents. Such marriages usually are the resuit of much deliberation and a careful

expected to have a measurable effect upon this ancient cultural custom of South India--except perhaps in producing a slow initial move away from this pattern by the more educated segments of society. If time brings increasing migration and mobility to villagers in South India, these factors would work towards a non-contrived lessening of consanguinity.

SOME ACCEPTABLE PATTERNS OF CONSANGUINITY IN SOUTH INDIA

FIG. 5.--The most frequent type of consanguinity (inbreeding) is between cross-cousins, preferably matrilateral, i.e., between aman andhis mother's brother's daughter (III 10-11111above), withpatrilateral unions acceptable but less common. Occasionally a parallel cousin union between children of sisters is encountered, but this usually is frowned upon. The taboo is strong against the parallel cousin marriagebetween children of brothers. Similarly, a man maymarry his sister's daughter (II 3-III 4 above) butnever his brother's daughter (see text for explanation). The cultural acceptanceof high consanguinity ratesbridges practically all socioeconomic classes and religions in South India, occasionally with some modifications. For example, wefound less restriction amongst the Muslims regarding marriages between parallel cousins and a general avoidance of uncle-niece unions.

This deliberate and relatively unemotional approach lends itself well to prophylactic, genetic counseling. Once a hereditary disease is known to exist in a family, one can predict the pattern of inheritance and advise families about low and high risk prospects. In the absence of a specific disorder on which to focus, knowledge of the empirical, overall, increased risks associated with consanguinity is not
