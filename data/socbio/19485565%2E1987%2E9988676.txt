ABSTRACT: Biosocial characteristics of 265 mentally retarded and 253 nonretarded children comprising 518 handicapped children from eastern India were studied to discern characteristics significantly associated with the retardates. The children studied were consecutive referrals between January 1977 and April 1981 to the Centre for Handicapped Children, Institute of Child Health, Calcutta. Comparison of retarded and nonretarded children showed the incidence of mental retardation to be significantly associated with age of children, age of mothers, parents' socioeconomic class, family size, birth order, tempo of motor development, and family history of psychiatric illness. The proportion of retardates was higher among the handicapped girls than among boys, and the level of retardation was significantly associated with sex. Implications of findings are discussed.

According to the World Health Organization (1977), the prevalence rate of "persistent and socially handicapping" mental health problems among children aged 3-15 years in developing countries is roughly similar to that estimated for the developed countries. As far as one of these problems, mental retardation, is concerned, the number of retarded children in India was estimated to be 1.4 to 1.8 million in 1966 (McHale and McHale, 1979). Official sources indicate that currently there may be at least two million such children in the country (Institute of Child Health and Hospital for Children, 1980).In all age groups an estimated 3to 5per cent of India's population suffer from various degrees of mental retardation (Sen, 1976). The Indian Planning Minister himself expressed concern in 1984 at the level of mental retardation among children, estimated at 0.5 to 1 per cent {Hindustan Times,1984).

Children who are, in general, exposed to disease, infection, malnutrition, poor health care and living conditions, and "reproductive casualty" (i.e., low birth weight, prematurity, pregnancy hazards, toxemia, etc.), are often victims of mental retardation. The relationship of poverty and deprivation to retardation is, however, associative and not casual (Begab, 1976). According to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, about 1.5 million children are born every year in India with geneticdisorders (Verma, 1981). Genetic factors are considered to have a predisposing role in the development of mental disorders, although the precise nature and importance of this role is not clearly known (Coleman and Broen, 1976).
In the above context, information on various psychosocial and biosocial characteristics associated with mentally disordered persons is essential for a proper understanding of the problems. There-

which often spread over two days, was conducted by one or the other of the two trained women psychologists (S. Chowdhury and M. Chakraborti, the two coauthors) working at the Centre. A uniform testing procedure was followed by both. Doubtful cases were seen by both psychologists before a diagnosis was made. Results of interview and testing were entered in standard record forms by the two psychologists. As data for the present study were gleaned from these case records, it may be reasonably assumed that such data had a reliability greater than could be attained through a population survey.
The data had one major limitation. Parents were asked to recollect significant events and behavior in their children's life which had occurred some years earlier. Information supplied, therefore, suffered from recall lapses. Many of the parents had no clear perception or understanding of what mental impairments could be as compared to physical handicaps. They often failed to seek timely help or intervention for their affected children until the symptoms intensified and the condition deteriorated. Such delay further suggested the problem of recall lapse.
The sample of children dealt with was not truly a representative sample of the handicapped child population, as it was not obtained through any systematic population sampling, nor did it properly cover the entire eastern region of India. The majority of children were from West Bengal, and over one-half of them came from the Calcutta Metropolitan District alone. The number of cases from the adjoining states of Assam, Bihar, Orissa, and Tripura was naturally small.
Nevertheless, the sample had certain special merits. Though it was not a ran-

dom sample, it was a truly consecutive series. The Institute of Child Health is meant solely for children, and any child who is referred to its Centre for Handicapped Children is attended to. There is no scope for personal selection or rejection. Further, the records showed that the composition and characteristics of the sample varied little from year to year. Keeping in view the enormous practical difficulty in terms of time, energy, resources, and even feasibility of conducting an epidemiological survey, an institutional sample like the present one may be the most feasible alternative to a population sample, especially in a developing country where literacy and health-consciousness among the population are low. The data and findings presented in the study are therefore to be viewed in the light of these considerations.
RESULTS
For each child, basic information was obtained on the following: (1) age; (2) sex; (3) diagnosis of defect; (4) level of intelligence (IQ); (5) mother's education and age at the time of child's delivery; (6) sociocultural group; (7) socioeconomic class; (8) family size; (9) birth order; (10) motor development; (11) mother's health during pregnancy; and (12) family history of psychiatric illness.
To get an overall idea about the sample, we first classified the 518 cases according to major variables of age, sex, and diagnosis. Of these, 265 (167 boys and 98 girls) were primarily diagnosed as mentally retarded, though 87 also had other syndromes. The remaining 253 cases (171 boys and 82 girls) were nonretardates suffering mainly from emotional disturbances and learning disabilities caused by other impairments. The

AGE, SEX, AND MENTAL RETARDATION
The distribution of children by sex, age, and mental retardation is given in

Table 3. Since the sample size is small, two-year intervals have been followed in dealing with the age distribution. The largest number of children are between 5.1 and 7.0 years, followed by children 7.1-9.0 years. Children between 5.1 and 11.0 years comprise 56 per cent of the total sample. In each age group, except the youngest, male retardates exceed females. Children in the lowest age group (3.0 years and below) account for only 8 per cent of cases. The number of

and then decreases with the advancing ages of children.
Examination of the age distribution (Table 4)shows that among the children 7.0 years or less nonretardates outnumber retardates, while among children7.1 years and over there are more retardates. There is a strong association between age of the children (below or above 7.0 years) and the number of mentally retarded (x2 = 12.75 with 1 d.f., significant at 1percent level).

Table 6 shows the distribution of mentally retarded children classified according to sexandlevels of retardation. Of the final sample of 500 cases, 253 were mentally retarded. Following the standard American Association ofMental Deficiency system (Grossman, 1977), the retardates have been sorted out under four groups, namely, mild, moderate, severe, andprofound.

retardated constitute the largest component followed immediately by the mildly retardated.
The chi-square test indicates a significant association between the degrees of retardation and the sex of the children (x2 = 8.98 with 3 d.f.; significant at the 5 per cent level). Proportionately, there are more males than females in the moderate and severe categories, while the opposite is true in the case of mild and profound categories.
MOTHER'S EDUCATION, AGE ATDELIVERY
AND RETARDATION OF CHILD
The World Health Organization has pointed out that children reared by very young mothers and those brought up in nuclear families with very many children are more likely to show problems in psychological development (WHO, 1977). It is also advised that late pregnancies, of mothers aged 30 years or more, should be avoided to prevent the birth of retarded children, especially those with Down's syndrome (Stern, 1968). Again, better education of the mother is expected to generate greater awareness

about judicious childbearing and efficient childrearing practice in a small family.
Table 7 gives the distribution of retarded children by mother's education and age at delivery. The mothers have been considered under four broad agegroups: (1) below 20 years (teen-age), (2) 20-24 years (young), (3) 25-29 years (adult), and (4) 30 years and more (older). As relevant information about age and education was not available for 27 mothers, they are excluded.
Of the 491 mothers, the teen-agers alone account for a little less than onefourth cases, while young mothers aged 20-24 constitute the largest group. The number is the lowest for older mothers, over 30 years.
About 53 per cent of the mothers are literate or have some few years schooling (Level 2). Illiterate mothers (Level 1) are present in about 1 per cent of the cases. About 35 per cent of the mothers are in the group with the highest level of education (Level 3), having completed secondary school or higher, with about 10 per cent of the educated mothers in Level 3 being university graduates.

Among the smallest educational group, illiterate mothers, 61 per cent have mentally retarded children. Among the literate or more educated mothers, the proportion of such children varies between 48and 50per cent. However, no significant association is found between mental retardation and level of mother's education (x2 =3.42 with2d.f.).
On the other hand, the proportions of mentally retarded children born of mothers of different ages (disregarding education) are observed to vary significantly. The ^-values for the differences between the proportions of retarded children among the teen-aged and young mothers, and again among the young and older mothers are 3.19 (p < 0.01) and 2.77 (p < 0.01), respectively. However, no significant difference exists between the proportionsobtained among the young and adult mothers.
SOCIOCULTURAL GROUP
AND MENTAL RETARDATION
Table 8 shows the frequencies ofretarded and nonretarded children classified under two broad sociocultural groups, namely, Bengali and nonBengali according to parentage of chil-

dren. Further breakdowns of the sample by sex andreligious affiliation areshown in Table 9. Thenumber of children with Bengali parentage isthree times greater than that of non-Bengali ones (Table8).

birth orders 1 and 2 than in higher orders, and this is true for India as a whole (U.S. Census Bureau, 1978; Agarwala, 1972; Gulick, 1971). Thus, higher occurrences offirst-and second-born children in the present study tally well with the all-India pattern. The chi-square test confirms that there is a significant association between the birth order of the children and mental retardation (x2 = 11.64 with 4 d.f.; significant at the 5 per cent level).
MOTOR DEVELOPMENT
AND MENTALRETARDATION
Although the sequence of motor development is the same for all children, the rate of development is known to be closely associated with the intelligence of the child (Illingworth, 1957). Based on information on the specific age (in months) of attainment by a child of some gross motor development like creeping, crawling, sitting, standing or walking, the children have been divided into two groups: (1) those showing a delayed tempo of development, and (2) those showing an appropriate (timely) development.
Table 13 gives the distribution of retarded and nonretarded children according to the tempo of motor development. In over half the cases motor development is delayed. This delay oc-

curs more frequently among the mentally retarded. Per 100 children with delayed motor development, as many as 67 are retarded, but among children with appropriate and timely motor de-

velopment, less than one-third are retarded. The chi-square test confirms that delayed motor development is significantly associated with incidence of mental retardation (x2 = 60.01 with 1 d.f.; significant at the 1per cent level).

MOTHER'S HEALTH DURING PREGNANCY
AND MENTAL RETARDATION
Mother's health during pregnancy is very likely to influence the growth and development of the offspring. The effect is serious if she suffers from diseases like anemia, hypertension, measles, small pox, jaundice, uterine bleeding, excessive vomiting, etc. The distribution of handicapped children by their mother's health during pregnancy is presented in Table 14. Of the 500 mothers, a majority (59 per cent) reported no illness during pregnancy although a sizeable proportion of their children were mentally retarded. Mentally retarded children did occur in a higher proportion among the mothers who reported being ill during pregnancy. However, no statistically

significant association between mother's health during pregnancy and mentalretardation is found (x2= 1.76 with 1 d.f.). This finding agrees with that of Ramanujam etal. (1969).

history ofpresence orabsence ofpsychiatric illness is shown in Table 15.That familial/hereditary factors play any significant role among the handicapped children under study can be inferred with respect tofamily history of paternal kin only. The chi-square test confirms that there isa significant associationbetween mental retardation and presence of psychiatrically illrelatives on the paternal side (x2 = 4.64with 1d.f. significantat the5percent level); butthisis not true for thefamily history ofmaternal kin(x2 = 2.55 with 1 d.f.). The findings are thus inpartial conformity with the conclusion of a previous study(Ramanujam etal., 1969).

FAMILY HISTORY OF PSYCHIATRIC ILLNESS
AND MENTAL RETARDATION
WHO (1977)authorities have noted that (a) variations in the psychosocial development ofchildren are strongly associated with thequality ofparent-child interaction, and (b) children reared by mentally disordered parents show an increased rate of mental health problems.
In thepresent study, some mothers of the handicapped children are found to be psychiatrically ill. Information elicited about presence of any psychiatrically illperson inthe paternal or maternal side of the family does suffer in many cases from recall lapse. Misreporting orunderreporting thus puts aserious limitation to such information. Nevertheless, thepresence of psychiatrically ill kin on the paternal side ofthe families (including father) of the handicapped children is reported in 27 per cent of cases. The presence ofsuch ill kin on the maternal side (including mother) is noted in22 percent of cases.

DISCUSSION
IMPORTANCE OF THE STUDY
Along with the United Nation'sspecial concern forthe world's disabled persons during 1981, there wasa renewed interest in India in understanding the problems of the mentally disabled children. The present study was adirect outcome of such nation-wide interestand activities. The study shows that in the
