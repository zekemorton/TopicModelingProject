ABSTRACT: A definitive replicable genetic linkage for a major locus underlying the susceptibility to schizophrenia has not been identified to date. Although there are several possible explanations for the failure to find linkage in schizophrenia, one major problem is that the range of phenotypic expressions of the genes for schizophrenia has not been clarified. A more refined understanding of the various phenotypic expressions of a gene related to schizophrenia would enhance the power of studies designed to detect a genetic linkage with a major chromosomal locus and would benefit other strategies for understanding the etiology of schizophrenia.
The genes for schizophrenia may be frequently expressed in relatives of schizophrenic patients, although with less severe symptoms than those of chronic schizophrenia. Two series of findings support this notion. Nonschizophrenic relatives of schizophrenic patients demonstrate an increased incidence of nonpsychotic schizophrenia-like symptoms and traits, and they manifest deficit performances on several different laboratory tests of neurocognitive functioning. A more refined phenotypic expression of a schizophrenia-related gene may thus be indicated by personality traits and subclinical neurocognitive deficits.
These personality traits and neurocognitive deficits are considered here as possible aids in the identification of affected cases in genetic linkage studies of schizophrenia. Terminology for different indicators of neurocognitive deficits is introduced, and the relative utility of personality traits and indicators of neurocognitive deficit for genetic linkage studies is discussed. As specific examples, schizophrenia-related personality traits that are unrelated to affective symptoms and performance deficits on tasks of eye tracking and continuous attention are considered for strategies for broadening phenotype characterization without reducing the specificity of affected case identification.

Ample evidence indicates that schizophrenia is partially due to genetic factors, yet the range of phenotypic expressions of the gene or genes for schizophrenia is unclear. Relatively few first-degree relatives of schizophrenic patients manifest schizophrenia, and the transmission of schizophrenia in families does not follow a classic Mendelian pattern. Two series of findings suggest that the genes for schizophrenia may be frequently expressed in relatives of schizophrenics, although with less severe symptoms than those of chronic schizophrenia. First, adoption studies suggest that the

incidence of schizophrenia-related personality disorders in the biological relatives of schizophrenic individuals has been found to be substantially higher than in the general population, and to be higher than the prevalence of schizophrenia itself in these relatives (Kety et al., 1975; Kendler et al., 1981). Second, performance on several different laboratory tests of neurocognitive functioning has been shown to be heritable and impaired not only in symptomatic and remitted schizophrenic patients, but also in individuals with schizophrenia-related personality disorders and in nonschizophrenic rel-

atives of schizophrenic patients. These studies suggest that the phenotypic expression of a schizophrenia-related gene may be indicated by nonpsychotic personality traits and subclinical neurocognitive deficits.
This paper suggests a strategy for increasing the power of genetic linkage studies of schizophrenia with the use of nonpsychotic schizophrenia-like personality traits and subclinical neurocognitive deficits that are more common in the biological relatives of schizophrenic probands. As specific examples, schizophrenia-related personality traits that are unrelated to affective symptoms and performance deficits on tasks of eye tracking and continuous attention are considered for broadening phenotype characterization without reducing the specificity of affected case identification.
The major advances in the late 1970's and 1980's in the development of molecular biologic and quantitative genetic techniques have led to enormously expanded opportunities for investigations of the genetics of clinical disorders, and progress has been made in identifying genetic markers for the genes responsible for a number of neuropsychiatric disorders. The application of these tools to the study of schizophrenia, for which there is strong evidence for genetic factors from twin (Gottesman and Shields, 1977) and adoption (Kety et al., 1975) studies, holds promise for ultimately localizing a gene or genes related to schizophrenia. One important method likely to be useful in achieving this goal is genetic linkage analysis employing gene mapping techniques.
To date, however, the results of

linkage studies in schizophrenia have been largely disappointing. Promising clues (Basset et al., 1988) and initial results in some families (Sherrington et al., 1988) have not been replicated or have been conclusively rejected in independent pedigrees (Kennedy et al., 1988; St. Clair et al., 1989; Kaufman et al., 1989; Kendler et al., 1989). Also, a number of possible candidate genes, such as the D2 dopamine receptor, have so far yielded negative results (Gelernteret al., 1989).
These divergent results may be due to a variety of factors such as heterogeneity, the assumptions employed regarding penetrance, ascertainment bias, Type I statistical errors, the inclusion of poorly defined "fringe" disorders with no prior evidence for a genetic relationship to schizophrenia, as well as a possible polygenic mode of transmission rather than transmission by a single or small number of major genes. See Plomin (1990) and McGue and Gottesman (1989) for a discussion of these issues.
The techniques associated with genetic linkage analysis are usually applied to diseases with clear patterns of Mendelian inheritance. In addition, the families studied are typically large multigenerational pedigrees with many affected cases. These two issues are greatly affected by the accurate characterization of the phenotypic expression of a schizophrenia-related gene. Genetic linkage strategies have been problematic for schizophrenia because there is no clear-cut mode of transmission for cases of chronic schizophrenia, and the presence of even two or three close relatives with schizophrenia is relatively rare. Even large families of

schizophrenic probands do not usually include several additional schizophrenic members. Furthermore, these "high density" families may not be representative of the large proportion of schizophrenic patients.
Another approach to linkage studies in schizophrenia is to direct efforts toward enhancing the informativeness of the more typically observed families by refining the characterization of the schizophrenia-related phenotype to include schizophrenia-related personality characteristics and subclinical indicators of neurocognitive deficit. Broadening the definition of a schizophrenia-related phenotype has serious hazards. In linkage analysis, the misclassification of nongene carriers as affected cases will provide misleading evidence for linkage between a genetic marker and a disease gene, thus artificially lowering the statistical odds that the marker and the gene are linked. Such an error in classification is more damaging than its converse, failing to identify a gene-carrier as such, which can more readily be accommodated as a reduction of gene penetrance. Therefore, a prerequisite for studies of genetic linkage in schizophrenia is to define the phenotype for a schizophrenia-related gene as precisely and accurately as possible without increasing the rate of false positives. In more general terms, linkage studies in schizophrenia will depend in large part on the achievement of strong sensitivity without diminished specificity.
Strategies for increasing levels of sensitivity while maintaining acceptable levels of specificity in the characterization of a phenotype for genes re-

lated to schizophrenia will now be considered.
REFINING PHENOTYPE CHARACTERIZATION WITH SCHIZOTYPAL PERSONALITY TRAITS
Genetic, biological, and phenomenological data suggest that schizophrenia is genetically related to other, less severe, nonpsychotic conditions. These conditions include personality disorders such as schizotypal personality disorder as defined by recent editions of the widely used Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, DSM-III (APA, 1980) and DSM-IIIR (APA, 1987), for psychiatric disorders. Direct empirical evidence for a "spectrum" of schizophrenic disorders, including narrowly defined schizophrenia as well as nonpsychotic conditions, first emerged from the Danish adoption studies of Kety et al. (1975). These studies identified relatives with diagnoses of "latent schizophrenia" and of "uncertain schizophrenia," which are diagnostic categories that would not fit within contemporary criteria for schizophrenia. These "borderline schizophrenia" disorders were more prevalent among the biological relatives of adoptedaway schizophrenic probands than among the biological relatives of adopted-away controls or the adoptive relatives of either group (Kety et al., 1975). Indeed, disorders with this "schizophrenia spectrum" were far more common than chronic schizophrenia, and only when these disorders were considered did the increased prevalence in the biological relatives of schizophrenics attain statistical signifi-

cance. Because of the genetic relationship between schizophrenia and milder nonpsychotic "schizophrenia spectrum" disorders, the identification of these personality characteristics among families of schizophrenic patients may be a critical factor for the successful identification of a schizophreniarelated gene.
The development of DSM criteria for schizotypal personality disorder was influenced by the results of the Danish adoption studies (Spitzer et al., 1979; Kendler et al., 1981). The criteria defining schizotypal personality disorder include items that are phenomenologically related to schizophrenia; these include "negative" symptoms such as social isolation and inadequate rapport, as well as quasi-psychotic or "positive" symptoms such as magical thinking, perceptual illusions, and peculiar ideation. Reanalyses of the Danish adoption data using DSM-III schizotypal criteria indicated significant increased risk among the biological relatives of the adopted-away schizophrenic probands compared to the biological relatives of control adoptees (Kendler et al., 1981). Most subsequent family studies of schizophrenic probands have found higher prevalence of schizotypal personality disorder traits among biological relatives compared to the relatives of controls (Baron et al., 1985). Results from these studies also suggest that this disorder may be more typical than schizophrenia as a variable phenotypic expression of a schizophrenia-related gene (Siever et al., 1991).
Despite this intriguing possibility, most studies of "familial" schizophrenia have not assessed the presence of schizophrenia-related personality dis-

orders among the family members of probands. Although factors such as family size and penetrance can crucially affect the results of family studies in schizophrenia, it is possible that many of the family history studies that have unsuccessfully attempted to identify possible clinical, neurochemical, brain structural, or outcome factors associated with a more genetic subtype of schizophrenia may have lacked a sufficiently sensitive definition of "familial" schizophrenia.
One reason for the failure to assess schizotypal personality disorder in these studies may derive from the fact that the family history method has typically been used for these studies. This method relies on family informants to provide information on all first-degree family members. As such, this method may have been regarded as too insensitive for the identification of the more subtle schizotypal personality disorder characteristics. However, family history criteria have been developed for schizophrenia-related personality disorder traits. These are primarily based on criteria for schizophrenia personality disorder from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. The morbid risk for schizophrenia-related personality has been reported to be increased in the relatives of schizophrenic probands versus those of medical controls (Kendler et al., 1984) and nonschizophrenia-related personality disorder probands (Silverman et al., 1986). In addition, an increased morbid risk of schizophrenia-related personality has been observed in the relatives of schizotypal personality disorder probands compared to other personality disorder probands (Siever et al., 1990). Finally, in several outcome studies,

schizophrenia spectrum disorders assessed by family history interview have been associated with more severe, treatment non-responsive, poor prognosis, "Kraepelinian" forms of schizophrenia (Keefe et al., 1987; Silverman et al., 1987). These family history studies provide evidence for a spectrum of schizophrenia-related disorders, including schizophrenia-related personality disorder characteristics that are genetically associated with schizophrenia.
Although increasing evidence has become available for the genetic relationship between schizophrenia and schizotypal personality disorder characteristics, recent investigations of the specificity of schizotypal personality disorder have indicated familial relationships not only to schizophrenia but to other nonschizophrenia-related disorders as well. A recent study employing the Danish adoption records found that while "less severe, schizophreniclike illness" was increased in the biological relatives of schizophrenic adoptees, it was also more common in the biological relatives of adoptees with affective illness compared to biological relatives of control adoptees (Ingraham, 1989).
Weak specificity for schizotypal personality disorder traits for relatives of schizophrenic patients compared to relatives of affective disorder (SquiresWheeler et al., 1988) has also been indicated by high-risk studies. The adolescent offspring of affective disorder parents and those of schizophrenic parents had more schizotypal personality disorder features compared to the offspring of controls. In fact, only the offspring of affective disorders were significantly more likely than controls

to have 3 or more, or 4 or more, schizotypal personality disorder features. In another study by these investigators (Squires-Wheeler and Erlenmeyer-Kimling, 1989), the rates of 3, 4, and 5 schizotypal personality disorder features · did not differ between young adult (ages 18-29) offspring of parents with schizophrenia or affective disorder.
Finally, a recent investigation using the family history method has also indicated poor specificity of currently defined schizotypal personality disorder traits for schizophrenia. Although, as noted earlier with an overlapping sample, the morbid risk of schizophreniarelated personality was increased in the relatives of schizophrenic and schizotypal personality disorder probands, it was also observed to be increased in relatives of borderline personality disorder patients (Silverman et al., 1991). This disorder is characterized by affective instability and impulsivity, and lacks a familial relationship to schizophrenia (Silverman et al., in press).
In sum, while adoption, high risk, and family history studies of schizophrenia clearly indicate a genetic relationship between schizotypal personality disorder and schizophrenia, recent investigations using a variety of genetic epidemiological methods have also indicated that current criteria for schizotypal personality disorder are not specific to schizophrenia.
Although many of these concerns have only recently been raised in terms of their impact on linkage studies of schizophrenia, evidence from several genetic-epidemiological studies suggests a variety of different hypotheses for a more specific characterization of a schizophrenia-related phenotype. In-

vestigations that focus on previously conducted adoption and twin study data have suggested that negative symptoms in the "schizophrenia spectrum disorders" (Gunderson et al., 1983) and in schizophrenia itself (Dworkin and Lenzenweger, 1984), rather than positive symptoms, may be more characteristic of a phenotype for a schizophrenia-related gene. For example, in a reexamination of the Danish adoption study records, negative symptoms among the "borderline schizophrenics" were the ones that best distinguished biologic relatives of schizophrenic adoptees from controls. In a reexamination of the records from five previously published twin studies of schizophrenia, concordance rates between monozygotic twins were significantly higher for probands who had a greater number of negative symptoms, but not for those with increased positive symptoms.
The distinction between schizotypal personality disorder signs and symptoms can also be made to refine the identification of personality disorder traits genetically related to schizophrenia. "Symptoms" refer to those personality disorder features that must be reported by a subject (e.g., unusual perceptual experiences) in a diagnostic assessment, while "signs" refer to features that do not depend on verbal reports but on the observation of a trained diagnostician (e.g., odd speech). In preliminary results from an ongoing family study of schizophrenia in rural Ireland, schizotypal personality disorder signs were found to improve the discrimination between the relatives of schizophrenic probands and controls more than schizotypal

personality disorder symptoms did (Kendleretal., 1989).
A third hypothesis for a more truly schizophrenia-related form of schizotypal personality disorder concerns the relation of affective personality disorder symptoms, such as affective instability, to schizotypal personality disorder features. Here, the emergence of schizotypal personality disorder features is conceptualized as the possible result of at least two independent processes. In some individuals, presumably especially among the relatives of schizophrenic probands, schizotypal personality disorder features may stem from a familial/genetic relation to schizophrenia. Alternatively, these features in others may be secondary to affective personality disorder symptoms and occur only during discrete periods of affective symptoms. This model is supported by recent high risk and family history data indicating substantial overlap between schizotypal personality disorder and borderline personality disorder features, the latter usually including prominent affective personality disorder symptoms, in offspring of major affective disorder probands (Squires-Wheeler and Erlenmeyer-Kimling, 1990) or infirst-degree relatives of borderline personality probands (Silverman et al., 1991), but not in those of schizophrenic probands.
The final test of validity for these or other models for improved diagnostic specificity for a schizophrenia-related phenotype must await the identification of a genetic linkage marker for schizophrenia. However, family study and related methodologies that include a sufficiently comprehensive assessment to accommodate the investiga-

tion of these models may contribute to the ultimate success of efforts to identify a linkage in schizophrenia. We will now turn to potential refinements of a schizophrenia-related phenotype based upon neurocognitive deficits.
REFINING PHENOTYPE CHARACTERIZATION WITH NEUROCOGNITIVE DEFICITS
Deficient or impaired performances on a variety of neurocognitive tests have been demonstrated in schizophrenic patients, other psychiatric patients, and the biological relatives of schizophrenic probands. The usefulness of these tests for genetic studies depends upon the prevalence and segregation of deficit performances in

these various groups. Table 1 outlines criteria for different types of indicators of neurocognitive deficit in schizophrenia research that are based upon data suggesting differential performances in various groups. The distinctions made among the different indicators were developed to aid in the assessment of the usefulness of different neurocognitive tests for genetic studies, and are discussed in fuller detail elsewhere (Keefe et al., in review).
It is important for geneticists and schizophrenia researchers to communicate accurately concerning the relationships between the genetics and the psychobiology of schizophrenia. One confusing trend in the schizophrenia research literature has been to refer to neurocognitive anomalies such as poor

TABLE 1
CRITERIA FOR INDICATORS OF NEUROCOGNITIVE DEFICIT IN SCHIZOPHRENIA RESEARCH
DIAGNOSTIC INDICATORS
1. The neurocognitive deficit occurs more frequently in individuals with a diagnosis of schizophrenia than in normals and individuals with other psychiatric disorders. 2. The deficit is not an indicator of exogenous factors, that is, it is not a result of the course of schizophrenia or its treatment, including phenothiazine medication and long-term institutionalization. 3. The deficit is not an episodeindicator, that is, it is not a state-dependent anomaly that exists only as long as the schizophrenic patient's episode of psychotic exacerbation exists.
PHENOTYPIC INDICATORS
1. The deficit meets the criteria for a diagnostic indicator. 2. The deficit occurs among the first degree relatives of schizophrenic probands at a higher rate than in normal controls. 3. Evidence from family, twin, or adoption studies suggests that the indicator is a manifestation of a genetically transmitted trait related to schizophrenia. For example, monozygotic twins demonstrate a higher concordance of the deficit than dizygotic twins of the same gender, and the indicator is more prevalent in unaffected monozygotic twins with schizophrenic co-twins than in unaffected dizygotic twins.
SPECTRUM INDICATORS
1. The deficit meets the criteria for a diagnostic indicator. 2. The deficit occurs in individuals within the entire spectrum of schizophrenia-related disorders, including schizophrenia, schizoaffective illness, and individuals with schizophrenia-related personality symptoms and traits. This latter group may manifest a broad range of severity, from clinically identified patients with DSM-III-R schizotypal personality disorder to college students and other volunteers who demonstrate schizotypal personality traits.

eye tracking as "genetic markers" or to the tests themselves as "marker tasks" due to their possible association with the genetics of schizophrenia. This terminology creates confusion, as geneticists have traditionally used the term "genetic marker" or "marker" to refer to a locus on a chromosome that is found to be linked with, and thus "marks" a gene of interest. For purposes of clarification, we therefore propose that these anomalies be referred to as indicators of neurocognitive deficit. Schizophrenic patients perform poorly on a variety of tests of neurocognitive functioning, and many indicators of deficit differentiate schizophrenic patients from normal subjects. However, many of these indicators are not specific to schizophrenia, as they are also found in other psychiatric patients. As an example, patients with major depressive disorders, like schizophrenic patients, manifest attentional disturbances and frequently perform poorly on tests of attention and distractibility. Anomalies that occur more frequently in schizophrenia than in normals and individuals with other psychiatric disorders can be considered diagnosticindicators. Although current neurocognitive tests are not able to replace, or even aid in, clinical assessment for the diagnosis of schizophrenia, the increased prevalence of a deficit in schizophrenics compared to other groups supports further investigation concerning its relation to the genetics of schizophrenia.
Some anomalies that are relatively specific to schizophrenia, and may appear to be diagnostic indicators of neurocognitive deficit related to schizophrenia, may not be associated with its etiology or pathophysiology. Rather,

they may be a by-product of the course of the illness or its treatment, including medication and long-term institutionalization. These deficits can thus be considered acquired traits, or indicators of exogenous factors. Other variables that can impair performance on neurocognitive tests without a direct relation to schizophrenia, such as age, general lack of motivation, and practice effects, can also be considered exogenous factors. It is obvious that neurocognitive impairment resulting from these factors will strongly interfere with the accurate determination of affected cases in genetic linkage studies.
For a neurocognitive test to be potentially useful for genetic studies of schizophrenia, it should be a heritable characteristic stemming from the same genetic factors as schizophrenia. As such, it is likely to persist in schizophrenic patients independent of their clinical state, including periods of remission. Some indicators of neurocognitive deficit are state-dependent, and characterize schizophrenic patients only as long as their episodes of psychotic exacerbation persist. These episode indicatorsmay be a by-product of the symptoms of psychotic exacerbation, or a manifestation of the neurocognitive changes associated with this clinical state. An indicator that is present only during periods of symptom exacerbation is unlikely to enhance the characterization of a schizophrenia-related phenotype. Thus, maximally useful indicators will not be episode indicators.
Previous characterizations of indicators of neurocognitive deficit in schizophrenia have included the term "vulnerability markers" to identify individuals who are theoretically "vul-

nerable" to schizophrenia, regardless of whether they are in an episode at the time of assessment (Zubin and Spring, 1977). The notion of vulnerability to schizophrenia and the characterization of deficit performances on neurocognitive tests as reflecting this vulnerability has been a useful construct with which to conceptualize schizophrenia as the possible end product of stress superimposed upon a possibly genetic diathesis. However, recent evidence suggests that studies involving individuals with personality disorders related to the "spectrum" of schizophrenic disorders, such as individuals with schizotypal personality disorder as defined by DSM-IIIR (APA, 1987), who do not develop schizophrenia and who may in fact possess characteristics that protect them from schizophrenia (see Kendler, 1986), also demonstrate anomalous performance on tests of neurocognition (Braff, 1981; Keefe et al., 19896). For this reason, it is important to distinguish between studies of neurocognitive deficits that suggest a "vulnerability" to schizophrenia and those that suggest an association with disorders that may be related to schizophrenia, genetically or otherwise, without necessarily predisposing an individual to the chronic severe psychosis of schizophrenia.
Many diathesis-stress models of schizophrenia make the assumption that predisposing factors are transmitted genetically (e.g., Meehl, 1962). However, a substantial proportion of schizophrenics have no identifiable schizophrenic relatives (Rosenthal, 1970). Low percentages of familial cases of schizophrenia have been explained by the suggestion that certain experiences, such as birth complica-

tions or other environmental stressors, may play a critical role in the etiology of schizophrenia (Walker and Emory, 1983). Thus, it is possible that different etiological factors may result in the core neural defects associated with schizophrenia, which may appear to be similar in cases with genetic and nongenetic predisposition (Harvey et al., 1986). Therefore, it is essential for studies of indicators of neurocognitive deficits to differentiate among those neurocognitive anomalies that appear to be associated with the phenotypic expression of genetic transmission factors in schizophrenia and those that are present in schizophrenia and schizophrenia-related disorders without a relationship to genetic transmission. To accommodate these data, we have expanded the categorization of indicators of neurocognitive deficits to include spectrum indicators, which refer to those anomalies that are demonstrated by individuals within the entire spectrum of schizophrenia-related disorders, including schizophrenia, schizoaffective illness, and schizophrenia-related personality symptoms. As discussed above, individuals in this latter group may manifest a broad range of severity, from the full set of schizotypal symptoms associated with clinically identified schizotypal personality disorder as defined by the DSMIIIR to mild schizotypal traits.
Finally, we propose that an indicator of neurocognitive deficit that represents the phenotypic expression of a gene or genes that predispose to schizophrenia be referred to as a phenotypic indicator. To be a phenotypic indicator for a gene or genes related to schizophrenia, the indicator is likely to satisfy the criteria for a diagnostic in-

dicator. The neurocognitive deficit must demonstrate a genetic relation with schizophrenia from family, twin, and/or adoption studies. Monozygotic twins should demonstrate a higher concordance of the deficit than dizygotic twins of the same gender, and the indicator would be expected to be more prevalent in unaffected monozygotic twins with schizophrenic cotwins than in unaffected dizygotic twins. Adopted-away offspring of a schizophrenic parent would be expected to demonstrate the deficit at a greater rate than adopted-away offspring of normal parents.
As reviewed above, data from family, twin, and adoption studies indicate that schizophrenia and some less severe psychiatric disorders including schizotypal personality may be phenotypic expressions of the same genotype. One current important question that should be addressed before neurocognitive indicators are used in genetic linkage analysis in schizophrenia is whether these indicators are subclinical phenotypic expressions of this same genotype, or whether they are dependent upon the presence of clinical schizotypal symptoms for reasons unrelated to inheritance. It is possible for a subclinical neurocognitive deficit to lack an association with clinical symptoms. Such a deficit would meet criteria for a phenotypic indicator without being a spectrum indicator. This type of indicator may increase the sensitivity of phenotype characterization without diminishing specificity. A neurocognitive deficit that meets criteria for a spectrum indicator may include acquired characteristics that are present in individuals with clinical schizotypal symptoms without biologi-

cal relatives with schizophrenia. These individuals may manifest spectrum indicators that are not phenotypic expressions of important genetic information. This distinction may be especially important in avoiding identification of "false positive" cases, or phenocopies, as affected cases in linkage analysis.
Several conditions that may obscure the association between a phenotypic indicator and a genetic disease have been discussed extensively by Gershon, Goldin, and Clerget-Darpoux (Gershon and Goldin, 1986; Goldin et al., 1986; Clerget-Darpoux et al., 1986). These authors consider the extent to which conditions of population stratification, biological heterogeneity of a clinical syndrome, secondary effects of illness or treatment, and complex biology of a syndrome may affect the outcome of high-risk and other genetic investigations using phenotypic indicators.
NEUROCOGNITIVE MEASURES
Continuous performance test (CPT) deficits and impairment of eye tracking functions are neurocognitive anomalies that have been demonstrated in schizophrenic patients, individuals with schizophrenia-related personality disorders, and the biological relatives of schizophrenic probands. They are thus promising candidates to be considered as "indicators" of neurocognitive deficit that may be related to schizophrenia and its predisposing factors. To establish what these indicators can offer genetic linkage analyses of family studies, the relevant findings concerning both of them will be reviewed.

EYE TRACKING: THE NATURE
OF THE TASK
As an individual attends to an object that moves across the visual field, a voluntarily initiated smooth pursuit eye movement (SPEM) system maintains the image of the object in the center of the retina. Once initiated, these eye movements operate largely independent of voluntary attention (Shagass et al., 1976; Pass et al., 1978; Lipton et al., 1980). Saccadic eye movements serve to fix the fovea again on the target in case of a foveal image slip during tracking. Smooth pursuit eye movements differ from saccadic eye movements in that the velocity of the former are normally slower than 36 degrees/ sec and are initiated voluntarily, while the latter can reach velocities of up to 700 degrees/sec and can be initiated either voluntarily or involuntarily (Young, 1963). Impaired visual tracking of an object can be reliably identified using a variety of recording methods and both qualitative and quantitative analyses (Iacono and Lykken, 1983; Holzman, 1983).
EYE TRACKING IMPAIRMENT AS A
DIAGNOSTIC INDICATOR
Eye tracking impairment clearly meets criteria for a diagnostic indicator as outlined in Table 1, as it occurs more frequently in schizophrenics than normals and individuals with other psychiatric disorders, and it is unlikely to be solely attributable to exogenous or episode factors. Incidence of eye tracking impairment in the normal population has been repeatedly estimated in the range of 5-9 per cent (Holzman et al., 1974; Shagass et al., 1976; Siever et al., 1982; Saletu et al., 1986), compared

with incidence of impairment in schizophrenics ranging from 53-86 per cent (Holzman et al., 1973; Klein et al., 1976; Lipton et al., 1983; Saletu et al., 1986). Poor eye tracking is not specific to schizophrenia, although its incidence in schizophrenics appears to be higher than in other psychiatric patients. Eye tracking has been found to be abnormal in 21 per cent of psychiatric patients with nonpsychotic disorders (Lipton et al., 1983) and 30-50 per cent of patients with affective disorders, particularly those with manicdepressive illness (Lipton et al., 1983; Shagass et al., 1974). Schizophrenics have performed significantly worse than manic-depressive patients in some eye tracking studies (Holzman et al., 1973; Iacono and Koenig, 1983; Levy et al., 1985), but a significant difference between these groups has not always been found (Shagass et al., 1974; Levin et al., 1981). However, poor eye tracking in remitted manic-depressive patients appears to be related to lithium treatment, as normal eye tracking in manic-depressives has been shown to become impaired when lithium is administered (Levy, et al., 1985). Recent data suggest that lithium-free manic-depressive patients in manic episodes demonstrate eye tracking performance consistent with normals (Amador et al., in press). Furthermore, the pattern of eye tracking impairment seems to differ between manic-depressive and schizophrenic patients (Iacono and Koenig, 1983; Amador et al., in press).
Eye tracking is unlikely to be impaired in schizophrenia merely as an indicator of a schizophrenic episode, since schizophrenic outpatients, judged to be psychosis-free by a clini-

cian, have also demonstrated impaired eye tracking (Iacono and Koenig, 1983). Eye tracking impairment does not appear to be a function of medication. There does not appear to be a clear association between eye tracking impairment in schizophrenic patients and antipsychotic medication initiation or discontinuation (Holzman et al., 1974; Holzman et al., 1975; Spohn, 1981). Other medications, such as barbiturates (Holzman et al., 1975), ethanol, and chloral hydrate (Levy et al., 1981) that have been shown to have a substantial effect on eye tracking performance are usually prohibited for subjects in eye tracking studies.
The effects of age of the subject are moderate, as age accounts for about 15 per cent of the variance among eye tracking performance scores (Holzman et al., 1977; Shagass et al., 1974; Kuechenmeister et al., 1977). This age effect should be strongly considered in assessing individuals for eye tracking deficit.

Impaired eye tracking of the type observed in chronic schizophrenia meets the criteria for a phenotypic indicator discussed above (see Table 1). A significantly greater proportion of parents of schizophrenic patients (40 per cent) have impaired eye tracking than do parents of manic-depressive patients, with parents of manicdepressives not differing from normals in the percent of smooth pursuit impairment (Holzman et al., 1984). Also, the observed concordance of eye tracking impairment is twice as high in

monozygotic twins compared to dizygotic twins (Holzman et al., 1978; Iacono and Lykken, 1979; Holzman et al., 1980). To account for this series of observations, coupled with the fact that 14-50 per cent of schizophrenics demonstrate normal eye tracking, Matthysse et al. (1986) suggested that the predisposition to schizophrenia is inherited as a latent trait that may be variably expressed as schizophrenia and/or eye tracking impairment. These authors fitted a mathematical model from previous family studies of eye tracking and schizophrenia that generated specific predictions regarding the prevalence of these disorders in families of schizophrenics. This model was successfully applied to an independent sample of offspring of monozygotic and dizygotic twins discordant for schizophrenia, manic-depressive disorder, or reactive psychosis (Holzman et al., 1988). Although this model may provide an accurate explanation for the familial distribution of eye tracking deficit and schizophrenia in some families, as discussed above, it is possible that the variable expression of a gene or genes for schizophrenia may be broader than schizophrenia and eye tracking dysfunction and may include schizotypal personality traits. In addition, other recent data suggest better eye tracking in the relatives of schizophrenics who have good eye tracking compared to the relatives of schizophrenics with poor eye tracking (Iacono et al., in press; Clementz et al., in press). These results suggest that poor eye tracking may be associated with the genetics of schizophrenia in only a limited percentage of families with a schizophrenic member.

EYE TRACKING IMPAIRMENT AS A
SPECTRUM INDICATOR
There is evidence that eye tracking impairment is present in individuals who manifest less severe disorders in the spectrum of schizophrenia and schizophrenia-related personality disorders and thus meets criteria for a spectrum indicator (Keefe et al., 198%; Siever et al., 1984, 1989). Furthermore, the degree of eye tracking impairment is more highly correlated with "negative" symptom characteristics than with "positive" psychotic-like symptoms (Siever et al., 1989, 1990).
Future work on the genetics of eye tracking deficit in schizophrenia needs to address the issue of whether it is a phenotypic indicator that is completely unrelated to mild schizophrenia-like symptoms in the relatives of schizophrenic probands or whether it is actually a spectrum indicator associated with schizophrenia-related personality traits in otherwise undiagnosed individuals. As discussed above, the incidence of subtle schizophrenia-related personality traits is greater in the biological relatives of schizophrenics than in the general population. Poor eye tracking may be dependent on the presence of these schizophreniarelated personality traits in relatives. Recent preliminary data from our center and others is consistent with this hypothesis, as relatives with poor eye tracking are more likely to manifest schizotypal symptoms (Keefe et al., 1989a; Clementz et al., 1989), such as deriving less pleasure from social situations (Keefe et al., 1991), or score higher on scales of schizotypal traits. (Grove et al., 1991). In addition, eye

tracking impairment has been associated with subtle disorders of language production as assessed by the Thought Disorder Index (Johnston and Holzman, 1979) in relatives of schizophrenics, even when these relatives were not overtly schizophrenic (Lipton et al., 1983). Collectively, these studies and those discussed below raise the possibility that eye tracking impairment may be associated with schizotypal features in the relatives of schizophrenics.
Demonstration of clear overlap between poor eye tracking and schizophrenia-related personality traits should not be taken to suggest the redundancy of either of these assessments. Given the potential for unreliability of each type of assessment, and the presence of each in some individuals outside schizophrenia-related populations, the use of both of these assessments conjointly may enhance specificity and sensitivity of phenotype characterization for genetic linkage studies.
The strength and consistency of the relationship between eye tracking impairment and the schizophreniarelated disorders in studies involving family, college student, and clinical populations provides support for the notion that eye tracking is not only impaired in schizophrenia, but is also impaired in the schizophrenia-related disorders and may serve as a phenotypic indicator of a schizophrenia-related gene or genes. However, the relationship between poor eye tracking and mild schizophrenia-related personality traits in relatives of schizophrenic probands and other individuals suggests that poor eye tracking may be a spectrum indicator. It has yet to be

determined whether poor eye tracking is primarily related to the genetic make- up of individuals with the deficit, the mild schizophrenia-related symptoms they manifest, or both. Future studies of eye tracking deficits in individuals in the schizophrenia spectrum may address this issue by further assessing the relationship between these mild schizophrenia-related symptoms and poor eye tracking.
CONTINUOUS ATTENTION
Attentional impairment is a central cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia, particularly the inability to maintain a major task set or sustain the readiness to respond to task-relevant stimuli over time (Shakow, 1962, 1979). A variety of measures of attention have been found to be abnormal in schizophrenic patients compared to controls and other psychiatric groups (Nuechterlein, 1977). These measures have included different tests of "continuous performance."
CPT: THE NATURE OF THE TASK
The phrase "continuous performance test" (CPT) suggests a single standardized testing procedure, but actually refers to a group of visual vigilance tasks in which subjects monitor a continuous series of stimuli that are presented very briefly (40-200 msecs) with an interstimulus interval of 1-1.5 seconds. The subject's task is to respond each time a predesignated target stimulus or sequence appears. Variations of the task have included target stimuli that are single letters or numbers, sequences of two letters or numbers (Rosvold et al., 1956), or playing cards (Erlenmeyer-Kimling and Corn-

blatt, 1978), perceptually degraded numbers (Nuechterlein, 1983), or picture stimuli (Anderson et al., 1969). The various methods of the CPT have been reviewed extensively by EarleBoyer et al. (in press). In the most common form of this task (the AX version) the subject monitors a display of letters presented rapidly one at a time and must respond whenever an "X" preceded by an "A" appears.
Traditional response parameters of the CPT include errors of omission (failure to respond to a target stimulus), and errors of commission (responses to nontarget stimuli). Analyses of vigilance performance in schizophrenic patients have increasingly employed the distinction between sensitivity and response criterion dimensions to discriminate two processes within vigilance performance (Nuechterlein and Dawson, 1984a). Sensitivity refers to the subject's level of discriminating target (signal) stimuli from nontarget (noise) stimuli. High sensitivity usually corresponds to a relatively high target hit rate (few errors of omission) and a relatively low false alarm rate (few errors of commission). Response criterion refers to the amount of perceptual evidence that the subject requires to decide that a stimulus is a target.
CPT IMPAIRMENT AS A DIAGNOSTIC
INDICATOR
Impaired performance on the CPT appears to meet criteria for a diagnostic indicator, although the evidence is weak. Schizophrenic patients make significantly more errors of omission and commission than normals on this task and have slower response times when they do respond correctly (Asar-

now and MacCrimmon, 1978; Walker and Shaye, 1982; Nuechterlein and Dawson, 1984a).
Although an attentional deficit as detected by the CPT does not seem to be a function of general acute psychiatric symptoms, very few studies have investigated the specificity of CPT deficit. While global attentional deficits as measured by the CPT have not been observed in some studies of affective disorder inpatients (Walker, 1981), other studies have reported that depressed patients demonstrate a specific inability to attend to spatial as compared to verbal stimuli and to make errors of commission, but not errors of omission (Cornblatt et al., 1989). While hyperactive children may make errors of commission, their corresponding decreased scores on response criterion measures suggest that some are due to impulsivity rather than inattention (Nuechterlein, 1983; Halperin et al., 1990).
Like hospitalized schizophrenic patients, remitted schizophrenics manifest significantly more omission and commission errors than normal controls (Asarnow and MacCrimmon, 1978; Wohlberg and Kornetsky, 1973), suggesting that a CPT deficit is not merely an episode indicator associated with acute psychotic exacerbation. However, not all schizophrenic patients perform outside of the normative range on the CPT. Deviant performance has been estimated to characterize 40 per cent of schizophrenics (Kornetsky and Orzack, 1978).
Although few studies have investigated the effects of medication on CPT performance, one early study suggests that schizophrenic patients withdrawn from all medication and functioning at

their premorbid level continue to perform poorly (Wohlberg and Kornetsky, 1973). Recent data suggests that schizophrenics on neuroleptics perform similarly on the CPT to patients who are medication-free, (Harvey et al., 1990; Nestor et al., 1991), while other data (Earle-Boyer et al., in press) suggest that medication improves CPT performance in schizophrenics, but their performance remains more impaired than manic patients and normals.
CPT IMPAIRMENT AS A PHENOTYPIC
INDICATOR
CPT performance may be impaired in children of schizophrenic probands and may thus meet criteria for a phenotypic indicator (Rutschmann et al., 1977; Cornblatt and ErlenmeyerKimling, 1985; Nuechterlein, 1983). Deficit performance on the CPT may thus be associated with a phenotypic expression of a schizophrenia-related genotype. More studies, including twin and adoption studies, are needed to clarify the genetic relationship between schizophrenia and CPT deficit.
CPT IMPAIRMENT AS A SPECTRUM
INDICATOR
To date, few studies have investigated CPT as a spectrum indicator. A CPT deficit appears to be present in nonpsychotic individuals who manifest mild forms of schizotypy based on personality questionnaire data, but data regarding CPT deficits in individuals meeting full DSM-III criteria for schizotypal personality disorder have not been reported (Nuechterlein, 1987; Lenzenweger et al., 1991).
As with studies of eye tracking, the relationship between CPT deficit and

ciation is stronger in the biological relatives of schizophrenic patients than in controls, this suggests that poor CPT performance is a phenotypic indicator, and may help refine the characterization of a schizophrenia-related phenotype. If the association between poor CPT performance and schizotypal symptoms is equally strong in relatives of schizophrenic patients and controls, CPT performance deficit may be a spectrum indicator that is unrelated to the phenotype of a schizophreniarelated gene and would not enhance accurate phenotype characterization.
In sum, the relationship between CPT deficit and the schizophrenia-

Eye tracking and CPT deficits have been demonstrated in schizophrenic patients, individuals with other schizophrenia spectrum disorders, such as schizotypal personality disorder, and relatives of schizophrenic probands. Table 2 summarizes the various types of indicators for which these tasks meet criteria. Although diagnostic specificity remains a critical issue, especially concerning CPT deficits, the consistency with which these indicators are impaired in individuals with schizophrenia, schizophrenia-related personality disorders, or personality traits and relatives of schizophrenic patients is impressive.

result of studies involving these neurocognitive anomalies is that they appear to be associated particularly with symptoms and personality traits such as social withdrawal and anhedonia that have been suggested as the "core" symptoms of schizophrenia. Given that these symptoms have been found to be more closely associated with the genetic diathesis in schizophrenia, further investigation of these indicators as potential phenotypic expressions of a schizophrenia-related genotype is warranted.
It is possible that eye tracking and CPT tests, both of which are visual tasks requiring focused attention, may be associated with related central nervous system impairments. Recent research from our center suggests that CPT deficit more powerfully discriminates schizophrenics and normal controls than eye tracking deficit. In addition, eye tracking deficits do not provide additional information above and beyond CPT deficits in these groups (Keefe et al., 1990). In relatives of schizophrenics, however, eye tracking and CPT deficits account for independent variance, despite overlap between them (Keefe et al., 1991). Future studies should focus on the relative independence and redundancy of the various neurocognitive functions that are measured by these tasks.
Several other critical issues in this area of inquiry need to be addressed by further study. First, are nonschizophrenic biological relatives of schizophrenic probands with poor eye tracking or CPT deficit more likely than other relatives to have mild schizophrenia-related personality traits such as the symptoms of schizotypal personality disorder? Coincidence of indica-

tor deficits and schizotypal symptoms, particularly "core" symptoms, may be a more refined expression of a schizophrenia-related gene than either of these characteristics in isolation. A definition of a schizophrenia-related phenotype in genetic linkage analyses that includes relatives with indicator deficits as affected cases may be too broad, severely hampering genetic linkage statistical analyses, but the presence of schizotypal symptoms in combination withindicator deficits may serve to improve the identification of affected cases without loss of specificity. Preliminary data suggest that eye tracking and CPT deficits may be more severe in relatives with schizotypal symptoms (Clementz et al., 1989). Thus, it may be possible to consider these relatives as affected cases in linkage analyses without increasing the rate of false positive errors.
Second, the degree to which CPT and eye tracking deficits serve as spectrum indicators versus phenotypic indicators is unclear. Are these indicator deficits equally likely to occur in individuals with schizotypal symptoms who are relatives of schizophrenic patients as in individuals who do not have a relative with schizophrenia, yet demonstrate these same mild, schizophreniarelated symptoms? This important issue may be difficult to investigate empirically. It is currently impossible to differentiate clearly individuals who manifest schizotypal symptoms as an expression of a schizophrenia-related gene and those who may express similar symptoms unrelated to a schizophrenia-related gene. Perhaps due to the low prevalence of the expression of a schizophrenia-related gene as full schizophrenia, an increased prevalence

of schizophrenia in the biological relatives of individuals with schizotypal symptoms has rarely been demonstrated (Lenzenweger and Loranger, 1989). Therefore, determination of a group of schizotypal individuals without family histories of schizophrenia is likely to include many subjects whose families would have yielded someone with schizophrenia given different familial circumstances, such as increases in family size, stress, andageof therelatives. Comparisons of indicator performances between schizotypals who have a biologically related family member with schizophrenia to those who do not will therefore require large samples of subjects and large effect sizes todetect differences between groups.
Addressing the issue of whether these neurocognitive deficits are best characterized asphenotypic indicators, spectrum indicators influenced bygenetic factors, or spectrum indicators completely unrelated to genetic factors will help determine the specificity and sensitivity of these indicators for determining affected cases in genetic linkage analysis.

The ultimate test of the usefulness of these putative refinements to the phenotypic expression of a schizophrenia-related gene will depend upon the identification of a genetic linkage marker or some other definitive biologic marker clearly associated with a genetic form of schizophrenia. In the meantime, however, family study and other methods of genetic epidemiologic investigations canbe employed to identify which personality features and neurocognitive deficits provide the best discrimination between schizophrenia-related and nonschizophreniarelated populations. By adding to our knowledge about a phenotype for schizophrenia, such studies, in turn, may well enlarge upon the opportunities for ultimately identifying a locus for a schizophrenia-related gene.
