ABSTRACT: Not much is known about the sexual attitudes of Chinese teenagers. In this article we endeavor to address this void by examining the sexual attitudes of Chinese teenagers with survey data collected in Sichuan Province in 1988.Our analysis has two goals: first, to describe aggregate attitudes toward premarital sexual practices; and second, to identify the principal factors that influence these attitudes. To accomplish the second goal we estimate several regression equations with predictor variables known to influence teen sexual attitudes. Our analysis reveals major differences and similarities between China and the United States and indicates that China's teenagers are somewhat strongly opposed to teen sexual contact, but seem to be more understanding of others who so engage, despite strict laws and public morality forbidding it.

Public morality regarding premarital sexual activity in China appears to be at odds with recent observations of the sexual behavior of the Chinese people, especially its teenagers. Indeed, the lead story in a recent issue of Asiaweek on "Sex in Asia" (1995, p. 39-40) observes that owing to the country's rapid economic changes, China appears to be "undergoing a Great Sexual Leap Forward." Whereas the norms are still restrictive, actual behavior seems to be somewhat more open.
Let us first examine the normative proscriptions, and then present the available, although limited, evidence about actual behavior. These introductory discussions will provide the backdrop for the subject of this paper, namely, the attitudes of Chinese teenagers toward sexual behavior and birth control.
Ruan (1991, p. 159-160) haswritten about the contemporary norms ofsexual morality in China as follows:

The only sexual behavior which is acknowledged to be legally and morally permissible is heterosexual intercourse within a monogamous marriage. (All other) imaginable variations (are) explicitly proscribed. Thus prostitution, polygamy, premarital and extramarital intercourse (including cohabitation arrangements), homosexuality, and variant sexual behaviors are all illegal.
With respect to Chinese adolescents, the norms clearly indicate that premarital intercourse is considered to be politically and culturally wrong. Moreover, technical forms of birth control are not available for the most part prior to marriage to anyone, irrespective of age (Wu et al., 1992).
According to China's Marriage Law of 1981, the minimum legal age atfirst marriage is 20 for women and 22 for men. (Officially, therefore, sexual contact among teenagers is classified, by definition, as premarital sexuality.) These age limits represent a decrease of two years each for females and males from the minima set forth in the

Marriage Law of 1950. Minimum ages were specified in the Marriage Law of 1950 because during earlier (precommunist) times, women, especially those living in the vast rural areas of the country, would often marry at age 15 or 16, and men would marry at ages roughly between 20 and 24 (Wolf and Huang, 1980).
In an attempt to give women equal rights with men in matters pertaining to the family, as well as to politics, the economy, culture, and society, the 1950 Marriage Law not only set minimum legal ages for first marriages, but also expressly prohibited arranged marriages, bigamy, concubinage, child betrothal, and interference with the marriage of widows (Zeng, 1986; Poston, 1992).
Given the sanctions of public morality and the virtual outlawing of marriages among teenagers, teenage fertility in China is nevertheless quite high. In 1990, China's age-specific fertility rate (ASFR) for 15 to 19 year olds was 107 per 1,000 women (State Statistical Bureau of China, 1991). In contrast, in 1988 the ASFR for 15 to 19 year olds in the United States was 54 per 1,000. While the fertility of 15 to 19 year olds makes up less than 3 per cent of the total fertility rate in the United States (National Center for Health Statistics, 1990), it represents about 5 per cent of China's total fertility rate (State Statistical Bureau of China, 1991). Given that the United States is viewed by many as a country with a major teenage pregnancy and fertility problem (see, for instance, Phoenix, 1991; Hofferth, 1990; and Bolton, 1980), the seriousness of the situation in China would appear to be even graver.

Turning now to premarital sexual behavior in China, Pan's (1993) recent analysis indicates an increase in both its levels and tolerance. To illustrate, over 8 per cent of the college students in his sample reported having experienced vaginal intercourse, and over 55 per cent of all of his respondents did not disapprove of couples who had engaged in premarital sex. Jankowiak's (1993) recent ethnographic study of Huhhot, a major industrial city in Inner Mongolia, also suggests that premarital sex is not at all a rare occurrence. Further, an analysis of the timing of the first births of Chinese women, conducted by demographers Wang Feng and Yang Quanhe supports in many ways the research findings of Sui-Ming Pan (1993, ms.) and William Jankowiak (1993). The Wang-Yang analysis uses data from the large scale 2/1,000 Chinese Fertility Survey conducted in 1988; their results indicate that about 5 per cent of all Chinese women had their first children born to them within, or before, the first eight months after their marriage date, and, moreover, this percentage has increased from about 3 per cent for women married in the mid-1960s to near 8 per cent for women married in the mid-1980's (Wang and Yang, 1993). This trend of increasingly higher percentages of women giving birth within, or before, the first eight months after marriage, is an indication of increases in levels of premarital conception. By the way, Rindfuss and Morgan (1983) have shown that this same trend, which they refer to as a "quiet revolution," has been underway for some time in the Asian countries of Korea, Malaysia, and Taiwan.

Another indication of premarital sexual activity in China is the use of abortion as a mechanism for controlling teenage pregnancy. In Shanghai, the abortion rate for 15 to 19 year olds was 56 per 1,000 in 1988. Rural adolescents had a higher rate (72/1,000) than urban adolescents (46/1,000), suggesting that teenagers in the rural areas may have even less access to contraception than those in the cities (Wu et al., 1992).
If no teenagers in China ever gave birth to children, a situation which would occur if the country's marriage and sexual activity laws and norms were strictly obeyed, the fertility rate would fall below replacement levels, a primary goal of China's current population policy (Gu, 1991). However, the elimination of teenage fertility in China does not appear to be likely given the fact that premarital (often teenage) sexual contact is somewhat common, especially in the urban areas.
Data and information such as the preceding provide us with information about the situation of teenage fertility behavior in China. However, very little is known about the attitudes of Chinese teenagers regarding sex and sexual behavior. In this article we address this void by examining the sexual attitudes of Chinese teenagers. We use data from a 1988 probability survey of 5,343 students in Sichuan Province, China.
Sichuan Province is the largest province in China, with a total population in 1990 of more than 107 million people. It occupies a middle position compared to the other provinces of the country in terms of levels of adolescent fertility. To illustrate, according to

data from China's 1990 Census, the Age-Specific Fertility Rate in 1990 for 15-19 year olds was 82.2 per 1,000 women in Sichuan; this figure may be compared to ASFR's for 15-19 year olds in Beijing and Shanghai of 23.5 and 20.6, respectively, which represent the lowest levels of teenage fertility in the country; and the Sichuan figure may also be compared to the corresponding ASFR's for Yunnan and Gansu Provinces of 168.3 and 154.9, respectively, which are among the highest levels of adolescent fertility in all of China (State Statistical Bureau, 1991, Table 1-22, p. 54).
Our analysis of teenage attitudes has two goals: (1) to describe aggregate-level attitudes regarding premarital sexual practices; and (2) to identify the factors that influence these attitudes. To accomplish the second goal, we estimate a series of regression equations using predictor variables that have been shown to influence teenage sexual attitudes in the United States. Since virtually no research has been published about teenage sexual attitudes in China, we necessarily must rely on the relatively large U.S. literature.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
TEENAGE FERTILITY AND SEXUALITY
This article examines teenage attitudes toward sex and birth control in terms of five structural relationships: sex differences, sex roles, access to information, parental communication, and socioeconomic status. In addition, in our investigation of teenage attitudes and their determinants, we control for rural/urban residence,

religiosity, grade, and school type. Regarding the available literature on premarital sexual behavior, with the exceptions of investigations of Cernada and his colleagues (1986) in Taiwan, and Perlman and his colleagues (1978) in the four countries of Canada, Bangladesh, Malaysia, and the United States, most of the literature we review focuses on the United States.
Males for the most part have been found to be more likely to engage in premarital sexual behavior, and to have more positive attitudes toward premarital sex, than females (Carroll, Volk, and Hyde, 1985; Hendrick et al., 1985; Cernada et al., 1986; Hendrick and Hendrick, 1987; Miller and Olson, 1988; Alexander et al., 1989). Adolescents with a boyfriend or girlfriend are more likely to have premarital sex or positive attitudes toward premarital sex than those without (Perlman et al., 1978; Bell and Coughey, 1980; McCabe and Collins, 1983; Miller, McCoy, and Olson, 1986).
According to Cernada and his colleagues (1986), premarital sex for both male and female students in Taiwan was viewed as acceptable by slightly less than one-quarter of their respondents, as long as the activity occurred with his/her fiancee, and by slightly more than one-tenth of the respondents if it was with someone he or she was not engaged to, but in love with. Although the literature does not appear to indicate much of a double standard for males and females, females are clearly seen to be not as permissive as males. For both males and females, premarital sex was seen as acceptable, if "in love," by about 3 per cent of females, but by almost 20 per cent of males.

The effects of sex education on the sexual attitudes and behavior of youth is a much debated one. Nevertheless, both Zelnik and Kim (1982) and Dawson (1986) have found it to have little or no effect on adolescents' sexual behavior, while having a positive influence on teenagers' use of birth control, if they are sexually active. In China, sex education programs were not developed until the early 1980's when it was believed and recognized that young people should be taught about birth control in order for population growth to be slowed. There was also an acknowledgment that teenage pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and sexual crimes committed by juveniles were important social problems. Consequently, sex education courses were being taught in 6,000 Chinese middle schools by the beginning of 1988, with plans being considered for sex education in all middle schools (Ruan, 1991).
Adolescents who have close relationships with their parents are less likely to engage in premarital sex (Perlman et al., 1978; Dawson, 1986; Hofferth, Kahn, and Baldwin, 1987; Miller and Olson, 1988). "Close" has been generally defined in the literature as referring to the degree of parent/child information sharing about important issues, including how pregnancy occurs, and by the degree of physical closeness, including living arrangements and time spent together. However, several studies have found this effect to be pretty much limited to daughters (Inazu and Fox, 1980; Moore, Peterson, and Furstenberg, 1986).
A question of particular interest concerns the degree to which the socioeconomic status of parents influ-

ences adolescents' sexual behavior and attitudes. Using parents' education, income, or both, several scholars have observed somewhat mixed effects of parents' socioeconomic status on teenagers' sexual behavior or attitudes. Compared to children with parents who are not socioeconomically advantaged, children of socioeconomically advantaged parents have been found to be less likely to have positive attitudes toward sexual contact (Inazu and Fox, 1980; Dawson, 1986; Marsiglio and Mott, 1986; Hofferth, Kahn, and Baldwin, 1987; Miller and Olson, 1988), or to have more positive attitudes toward sexual contact (Perlman et al., 1978; Bingham, Miller, and Adams, 1990), or to be no different (McCabe and Collins, 1983). However, it has generally been found that after controlling for level of sexual activity, contraceptive use is much more prevalent among children of parents with high socioeconomic status (Dawson, 1986). We thus anticipate little or no influence of socioeconomic status on attitudes toward sex, but a positive influence on birth control attitudes.
Little attention has been directed to the effect of sex roles on sexual behavior and attitudes. However this is a potentially important predictor given that one's perception of the position and roles of females, as opposed to males, should also affect one's attitudes and behavior. We do know for instance that as gender roles have changed, sexual behavior and attitudes have also changed (Schaffer, 1981). Accordingly, gender roles would appear to be especially important in the shaping of one's attitudes toward sex and birth control and the kind of behavior deemed appropriate for the person and

others. Despite the lack of literature on sexual behavior or attitudes in China, we expect that teenagers with more progressive sex role views will have more positive attitudes toward sex and birth control.
DATA
The data1 used in this study are taken from a probability survey of 5,343 students in grades seven to twelve in Sichuan province, China; the survey was conducted in 1988. The questionnaires were self-administered in the classrooms of the sampled schools. From the urban areas, four non-key and six key schools were chosen, while seven non-key and three key schools were chosen from rural areas. Key schools are schools selected by the government that are given more funding, better teachers, and better facilities and equipment, in general, than non-key schools (Yu, 1990, p. 64-82). Of the 6,000 questionnaires administered, 90 per cent were returned,, producing a sample of 2,942 males and 2,401 females (Yu, 1990, p. 64-82).
In our analysis we first examine aggregate teenage attitudes toward sex via responses to six questions that ask about the respondent's sexual attitudes, as follows: (1) One should not have sexual relations before marriage. (2) If your boyfriend/girlfriend wanted to have sexual relations, what would you do? (3) No decent man can respect a woman who has had sexual relations before marriage. (4) A man will lose

respect for his girlfriend if she agrees to have sexual relations with him. (5) Who has the right to use birth control methods to avoid pregnancy? (6) When would you use birth control methods to avoid pregnancy? Each question is scored with a four- or fiveitem Likert-type scale, with the higher score indicating a more permissive attitude.
With regard to the questions we used to measure our independent and control variables, they are the following: (1) Do you presently have a boy/ girl friend? [1 = no, 2 = just dating, 3 = going steady] (2) Two questions, namely, a wife should obey her husband, and a woman should stay at home, are combined into a "Gender Roles" variable, scored with a Likerttype scale, where a higher number indicates a more progressive view of gender roles. (3) How many times a week do you read a newspaper? [1 = never or almost never, 2 = once in a while, 3 = one or more times a week, 4 = every day] (4) How much information about sex have you obtained from friends and books? [1 = none, 2 = very little, 3 = a little; 4 = some, 5 = a lot] (5) How many birth control methods do you know about? [1 = none, 2 = 1 know about 1 or 2 methods, 3 = 1know about 3 or more methods] (6) How much information about sex have you obtained through formal education [answers are the same as in question #4] (7) Do you share your inner feelings with your parents? [1 = not really, 2 = sometimes, 3 = always] (8) What is the combined level of your parents' education [scale ranging from 1 = did not finish primary school, to 7 = college graduate] (9) Do you reside in a city? [1 = yes, 0 = no]

(10) Confucianism is important for the school curriculum [1 = not important, 2 = somewhat important, 3 = very important] (11) What is your grade in school? [1 = 7th grade, 2 = 8th grade, 3 = 9th grade, 4 = 10th grade, 5 = 11th grade, 6 = 12th grade] (12) Do you attend a key school [1 = yes, 0 = no].
RESULTS
DESCRIPTIVE FINDINGS
Before discussing the descriptive findings, we present some information on the background characteristics of the respondents. The sample consists of 5,343 students, of which 55 per cent (2,942) are male, and the remainder female. The students' average age is 16 years. Almost all the students (96.8 per cent) are of the Han (majority) nationality. Most of the students (88.6 per cent) live with both parents.
In Table 1 we provide sex-specific frequency distributions for each of the six attitudinal questions. The first two questions ask specifically about the respondents' attitudes about premarital sexual behavior. Two-thirds of the males, and three-fourths of the females, do not favor engaging in sexual activity prior to marriage (Question 1). And slightly less than half of the males, but more than 70 per cent of the females, would refuse, or try to refuse, if the girlfriend/boyfriend wanted to have sexual relations (Question 2). While the responses to these two questions do not indicate total opposition to premarital sexual activity, they surely do not reflect the attitudes of a sexually permissive society.
The next two questions ask about the respondents' overall philosophical

view of persons who engage in premarital sexual intercourse. About 30 per cent of the males, and a little less than 30 per cent of the females, agree with the statement that no decent man can respect a woman who has sexual relations before marriage (Question 3). In a similar vein, slightly less than 20 per cent of the males, and slightly more than 20 per cent of the females, agree with the statement that a man will lose respect for his girlfriend if she agrees to have sexual relations with

him (Question 4). These two questions do not pertain to the respondents' views about themselves participating in premarital sex, but instead to their more general attitudes about others. In this regard, roughly 70-80 per cent (slightly more or less depending on the person's gender) do not subscribe to a position against premarital sex.
The last two questions ask about birth control, namely, who has the right to use it and would the respondent use it. About 6 per cent of the

148

Kaufman et al.

Social Biology

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

males and 4 per cent of the females reply that no one has the right to use birth control. However, almost 37 per cent of the males, and almost 41 per cent of the females, do not know an answer to the question. Regarding the question of when the respondent would use birth control, a little more than 20 per cent of both sexes say "never," and about one-third say "only after marriage." About 44 per cent of both sexes respond that they would use birth control whenever they need to, or that they have already used methods (less than 1 per cent of both sexes giving this latter reply).
Three broad patterns are evident in the students' responses on these attitudinal questions about sexual behavior. First, teenage sexual attitudes are fairly conservative, especially with regard to attitudes about self-conduct (see the distributions for Questions 1 and 2 in Table 1). Most teens do not seem to agree that premarital sex is acceptable and do not agree that it is okay to consent to have sex with one's boy/girlfriend. Conversely, the Chinese teens are much more permissive with regard to their views about "respecting" females who have engaged in premarital sex.
Second, there are significant differences between males and females in the answers given to most of the questions. In three of the first four attitudinal questions about sexual behavior in Table 1, males exhibited a more positive attitude toward premarital sexual relations than females, a difference which is statistically significant at the 0.001 level. This is not an unexpected result, given our knowledge of studies conducted in the United States. This difference is particularly noticeable in

the responses to Question 2, i.e., "What would you do about having sex with your boyfriend/girlfriend?" Only 2 per cent of the females indicated they would consent, compared to 8 per cent of the males.
Finally, although most students do not seem to approve of premarital sex, it is not at all the case that they would condemn others who so engage. In response to the statement in Question 3, i.e., "No decent man can respect a woman who has had sexual relations before marriage," males and females have similar attitudes, with one-half of the females and a little less than onehalf of the males disagreeing or strongly disagreeing. In support of this finding is the related finding that a large percentage of teenagers believe that most others share these permissive beliefs: 46 per cent of the females and 55 per cent of the males disagree or strongly disagree with the statement in Question 4, "A man will lose respect for his girlfriend if she agrees to have sex with him" (see the distributions for Questions 3 and 4 in Table 1).
Given these very different distributions on the six attitudinal issues, we opted against factoring them into a single index of sexual attitudes. There is too much variation in the responses to warrant the construction of a single attitudinal index.
Responses to the questions that tap the independent variables reveal several important patterns (tabular data not shown, but available from the authors). First, most adolescents do not have a boyfriend or girlfriend, but if they do, they are more likely to be going steady than dating. Female adolescents appear to be more progressive in terms of sex role views than their male

counterparts, although most males do not seem to think that women should stick to traditional roles. Indeed, the males in our sample had a high mean level of disagreement with the statement "A wife should obey her husband," although they did not disagree as strongly as females.
In terms of information sources, most students read a newspaper quite often, with 71 per cent of the females and 73 per cent of the males reading a newspaper at least once a week.Compared to females, males have generally received more information about sex and family planning from friends and books. While only one-fifth of females have received some or a lot of sex information, nearly one-third of males have received some or a lot. At the other end, over one-half of the females and two-fifths of the males have received no or very little information. Males also have an advantage over females when it comes to birth control knowledge, though it seems that neither is very well informed. Over onehalf of the males andover two-thirdsof the females have not heard about any method to avoid pregnancy. Asfor formal sexeducation, over three-quarters of both the males and thefemales have received no or little information about sex from courses and teachers.
Adolescents, both male and female, do not appear to be inclined to share their feelings with their parents. Only 15 per cent of both females and males indicated that they share their inner feelings all the time with their parents.
The parents' education variable ranges from none to finished university, although few parents have gone beyond secondary school. More than two-thirds of the students live in a

small town or village, rather than in a city. When asked the importance of Confucianism for the school curriculum, 30 per cent of the males and28 per cent of the females responded "not important," and 14 per cent of the males and 15 per cent of the females responded "very important."
MULTIVARIATE FINDINGS
We report now the multivariate results from the tests of our hypotheses. Males and females are treated separately because of the statistically significant differences in their frequency distributions for most of the dependent variables (see above). Therefore, twelve equations are estimated, two for each of the sixdependent variables. Ordinary least squares regression procedures are used, and the estimated regression parameters are shown in Table 2a for females, and in Table 2b for males. Thesix dependent variables have been abbreviated with single word references in the table, as follows: (1) One should not have sexual relations before marriage (Sex). (2)If your boyfriend/girlfriend wanted to have sexual relations, what wouldyou do? (Want). (3) No decent mancan respect a woman who has had sexual relations before marriage (Respect). (4) A manwill lose respect for hisgirlfriend if she agrees to have sexual relations with him (Lose). (5) Who has the right to use birth control methods to avoid pregnancy? (Right). (6)When would youuse birth control methods to avoid pregnancy? (Use).

role views (as measured with questions about the wife obeying the husband and the woman staying at home), the results were mixed. For both males and females, those with more egalitarian sex role attitudes have more negative attitudes toward premarital sex in general, and toward their engaging in premarital sex in particular (see the negative coefficients in the second row of Equations 1-2 for females and 1-2 for males). However, those with more egalitarian sex role attitudes are more likely to have respect for women who engage in premarital sexual activity, and to respect girlfriends who have had premarital sex (see the positive regression coefficients in Equations 3-4 for females in Table la and for males in Table 2b). In addition, egalitarian sex role views have a positive effect on male and female attitudes toward birth control rights (Equation 5 for females and males).
Access to Information.--Reading the newspaper appears to have a negative effect on female attitudes toward respect for a friend who has had premarital sex (Equation 4, Table 2a), and on male attitudes toward premarital sex in general (Equation 1, Table 2b). Neither sex information from friends and books, nor birth control knowledge, appear to influence in a statistically significant way the attitudes of females toward premarital sex. However, both sex information and birth control knowledge tend to have a positive influence on female attitudes toward birth control (Equation 5, Table 2a). In contrast, sex information has a significant and positive effect on all six dependent variables measuring male attitudes toward premarital sex and birth control (Equations 1-6, Table 2b). Also, birth control knowledge ap-

pears to influence positively male attitudes toward them having premarital sex, respect for a girlfriend who has had premarital sex, birth control rights, and birth control use (see Equations 2, and 4-6, Table 2b). Although sex information gleaned from friends and books appears to have an effect on male attitudes toward sex, sex education as taught in school has virtually no influence on either male or female attitudes toward sex. It does appear, however, to have a negative effect on female attitudes toward birth control rights (Equation 5, Table 2a).
Parental Communication. --Sharing feelings with parents appears to have a large negative impact on male attitudes toward premarital sex, respect toward women who engage in sex, and toward birth control rights. This finding is consistent with the proposition in the literature that parents often oppose teenage sexual contact, and that sons who hold positive attitudes toward sex tend to avoid sharing information with their parents. Females who share information with their parents, on the other hand, do not appear to be different from females who do not share such information.
Socioeconomic Status.-- Parents' education has virtually no effect on either male or female attitudes toward premarital sex or birth control. This finding is consistent for the most part with research conducted in the United States discussed in earlier paragraphs of this paper.
Control Variables. --Females who live in a city are less likely to believe that men will have respect for girlfriends who agree to have sex, compared to females living in rural areas (Equation 4, Table 2a). On the other hand, city residence has no effect on

male attitudes in any of the estimated equations. This finding might help explain the study results discussed in earlier paragraphs regarding higher abortion rates among rural females. Under the assumption that male proclivity toward sexual intercourse is more or less consistent across the rural and urban areas of China, one would expect higher teenage pregnancy and abortion rates in rural China due to residential differences in female attitudes toward contraception.
Confucianism appears to influence negatively the likelihood that males will consent to sex with a girlfriend and have respect for a woman who engages in premarital sex. Confucianism also has a negative influence on the belief of females that a man can respect a girlfriend who has had sex with him. Although there are substantial differences between Western religions and Confucianism in terms of their doctrines and expected behavioral patterns, the effects of (Western) religious beliefs on attitudes toward sexual behavior do not appear to be terribly different from those of Confucianism.
CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
Our study of teenage sexual attitudes in China had two objectives: (1) to describe the aggregate attitudes of teenagers about their sexuality, and (2) to identify the constellation of factors that tends to influence these attitudes. Owing to the fact that in China, it is not legal for teenagers to marry, teenage sexuality is, by definition, premarital. With regard to our first objective, we found that teenagers in China do not find premarital sex to be very accept-

able self-conduct, yet they appear to be unlikely to admonish or otherwise disrespect teenagers who engage in sexual activity. We thus find rather strong opposition to premarital sex among China's teenagers, but the opposition is a little relaxed among males who appear to be fairly predisposed toward others having sex.
However, given the somewhat strong opposition toward sex among China's teenagers and the unavailability of contraception to unmarried couples, China's high teenage fertility rate is a little surprising. Since the reduction of teenage fertility would appear to be an important objective in achieving the goals of government fertility reduction, we would not be surprised were policy makers to eventually move in the direction of providing teenagers with at least modest access to contraception and knowledge about contraception. Because our findings lead us to conjecture that there is considerable demand for contraception among teens, such a policy would probably be a very successful one.
We addressed our second objective by establishing a set of expectations based upon research, most of which was conducted in the United States. This strategy was necessary owing to the paucity of research in China about teenage attitudes toward sex. In general, our results are consistent with U.S. research with the following major exceptions regarding parent-child relationships. Our findings indicate that close parent-child relationships in China have a significantly negative influence on male attitudes toward premarital sex, but not on female attitudes toward premarital sex. In China, boys are valued more than girls, and parents
