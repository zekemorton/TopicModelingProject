The determinants and consequences of mate choice in man have long occupied the attention of both biological and sociological investigators. For the geneticist, the primary concern has been to evaluate departures from the idealized panmictic model upon which so much evolutionary theory has been based. Such studies have been concerned principally with (1) the consequences of assortative mating with respect to Mendelian inheritance (for example, Crow and Felsenstein, 1968), and more substantively, evaluations of the strength of correlation between mates with respect to physical traits (Spuhler 1962,1968), (2) effects on rates and types of consanguinity brought about by age and sex stratification within a population of finite size (see Barrai, Cavalli-Sforza, and Moroni, 1962), and (3) estimates of the effective size of population isolates or breeding "neighborhoods" (for a review, see Morton, 1969).
The social scientist, on the other hand, has been seeking to define those social, cultural, and psychological processes which govern mating behavior and make it predictable. Eckland (1968) has reviewed a number of sociological theories of mate choice. These theories include various at-

tempts to explain mate choice on the basis of such factors as psychological and personality trait correlations, group values, economic exchange, several aspects of social, educational, and ethnic stratification, and geographic propinquity. Restrictions on mate choice may be inherent in the demography of a population, and some effort has been made to evaluate the limits imposed on mate choice by the age and sex structure of a population (see, for example, Akers, 1967).
There is no doubt that many of the methods discussed by Eckland would be difficult to apply to primitive populations. The majority of the sociological studies, as well as the genetic, have been done on large national populations where the characteristics of thousands of married couples may be investigated. Anthropologists, however, typically must deal with populations which contain a few hundreds or thousands of individuals in Mo, and where consequently the number of married couples is so low as to make impossible reliable evaluations of all but the most widely distributed characteristics of those involved. In addition, personality traits affecting mate choice, if they play any part at all in such groups, may be difficult to assess by outsiders; bases for stratification may be limited; and complex

rules of endogamy may make geographical propinquity an exceedingly difficult concept to apply. For all of these reasons, anthropologists have relied heavily upon interpretation of values, analysis of economic exchange (broadly denned), and to a very large extent, upon explicit statements about marriage rules and kinship terminology from informants for elucidation of the social and mating structure.
Primitive populations are of considerable interest to geneticists because they supply our best estimates of response to the conditions under which most of man's evolution has occurred (Neel, 1969). The fact that they tend to be small is one of these conditions and has of itself effects on genetic, demographic, and social structure. Aside from the difficulties mentioned above which are encountered when dealing with these populations, small size does provide some advantages. It is often possible to enumerate and construct pedigrees for the entire population and to perform tests on all individuals rather than on a sample. Elucidation of structure may further be enhanced if these populations are isolated from genetic or cultural mixing with others.
Quantitive methods for the analysis of the structure of small populations are in short supply. With respect to mate choice, some of the standard population genetics measures are applicable and others are being developed (MacCluer and Schull, 1970; see also Ward and Neel, 1970). There are also some notable exceptions to the nonquantitive approach taken by most anthropologists. These have involved the construction and analysis of genealogies by computer (Coult and Randolph, 1965) and the prediction of specific types of consanguineous mating in populations both real (Mark, 1967; Goldberg, 1968) and simulated (Kunstadter et al., 1963; Gilbert and Hammel, 1966).
This paper is intended as a step toward a quantitative characterization of marriage

possibilities in a single small population. One of the most important elements in population genetic theory is the concept of random mating. In a bisexual population this implies in the strictest sense that any male has an equal probability of mating with any female in the population. It is obvious that this is not the case in human populations. Hajnal (1963) corrected for one important deviation by denning random mating in man as the state which exists if the chance that two opposite-sexed individuals marry depends only on the interval between their dates of birth. Using this definition, he constructs a model which roughly predicts the distribution of consanguineous marriage types in several large populations in the world. With small populations, however, the number of individuals in any age class may be so small and variable that the actual opportunities for mating into that class bear little relationship to the probabilities predicted by models such as Hajnal's.
Some form of long-term union of opposite-sexed pairs is typical of all human societies. Although the term "marriage" usually implies a more formal and institutional definition than is necessaryhere,itwill be used to describe such unions. Marriage, then, represents a form of sampling without replacement from the pool of eligible mates which is likely to further reduce the randomness of mate choice among the unmarried. Also, where numbers are critically low, members of the nuclear family and other close relatives who are culturally proscribed as mates may make up an inordinate proportion of opposite-sexed individuals. The method used here defines some of these restrictions and shows their consequences on numbers, age, and relationship of potential mates. Implicit in the study is the assumption that all individuals can be classified according to their availability for marriage. The limits of availability are determined by cultural rules governing age and family relationship of mates and by opportunities afforded by the

demographic structure of the population. If these rules and the demographic structure can be described, it is then possible to define for each person an upper limit of oppositesexed individuals who are potential mates.
THE POPULATION
The Northside French of St. Thomas, V.I., occupy two quarters (administrative subdivisions) located on the central northern mountain slopes of the island. The community had its origins in the middle of the nineteenth century as land parcels became available to immigrants from the French West Indies island of St. Barthelemy (St. Bart). As in the districts on St. Bart where they originated, the principal source of subsistence until recently has been farming, augmented by occasional fishing (see Dyke, 1970; Morrill, 1967; Morrill and Dyke, 1966; Lasserre, 1961). Immigration began gradually and reached its peak in the early decades of the twentieth century; in 1966 only about 10% of the live population had been born on St. Bart, most of these being older people.
Although geographically scattered, the Northside community is tightly organized and until the recent growth of the tourist industry in the Virgin Islands has been highly endogamous. Increasing integration of the island into the mainland economy is beginning to break down traditional values, as might be expected; but despite an increased tendency for young people to move out of the community, few outsiders marry in. Northsiders are Roman Catholic and abide quite strictly by church sanctions regarding baptism, and to a lesser extent by those regarding marriage, for there are a few consensual unions. These appear to be nearly as stable as legitimate marriage, however, and divorce is rare. Illegitimate births occur infrequently, and in most cases it has been possible to establish paternity with some degree of confidence.
Vital information for this population is

available from several sources. Parish records provided rather detailed information on birth and marriages, and on family relationships. Government vital statistics records proved more useful for information on deaths and served as a check on parish records, as did information on property inheritance taken from land transfer records. A household census made by Morrill in 1962 served as a preliminary guide to family relationships. A total of 1,219 individuals born between 1816 and 1966 was ascertained from these sources, of which 661 (347 males and 314 females) were alive in 1966. For purposes of this study, 437 males and 391 females born between 1890 and 1966 were selected. This included all those born on St. Thomas, unmarried immigrants from St. Bart, and 13 non-French females who married into the community between 1908 and 1966.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data collected for each individual consisted of sex, name, date of birth, date of death, father, mother, spouse, and date of marriage. These were coded and placed on a punched data card. A computer program was written which sorted on the basis of parental identification-code numbers so that ancestral lines could be established. A printout was made for each sibship in such a way that sibs were grouped in order of birth, followed by all ancestors in order of relationship from parents to great-great-grandparents. This listing made possible relatively quick checking of accuracy and determination of linkages of pedigrees. In addition to the listing, a single punch card was prepared automatically for each individual by means of the same basic sorting instructions given the computer. This card contained coded information for sex, ego's birth, death, and marriage dates, and identification number for ego and all his ancestors through greatgrandparents.
Another computer program was written

RESULTS
NUMBERS OF POTENTIAL MATES
The sample described above consists of all individuals who became available for marriage at any time between the years 1908 and 1966. Simple comparison of the total numbers of the sexes without taking into account demographic restrictions and cultural factors which influence marriage does not give a reasonable estimate of the actual numbers of marriageable persons available to individuals at a given point in time, or at a given age. A general procedure was followed which found the total number of egos (iV,-) in each of i classes of mating eligibility, summed the total numbers of opposite-sexed individuals (Af#) appropriate to each ego j , and divided this sum by the number of egos in each eligibility class:

143 first marriages where the ages of the couple were known, it was noted that males married only between the ages of 18 and 45. For females, the comparable ages were 15 and 40. These ages correspond approximately to the reproductive period for women and to the age of greatest economic productivity for men. Using them as limits of mating age, calculations were again made by age of ego and by calendar year. The figures used as examples in the previous class become reduced to (a) 93.55 females for 25-year-old males and (b) 141.85 females for males of mating age in 1966.

excluded from all but Curve I. The histograms at the bottom of Figures la and \b represent the observed distribution of age at first marriage for males and females respectively. CurveVrepresents a mean upper limit of numbers of potential mates. The location of the mode at age 35 for male, and age 23 for female egos is a function of the age-differential limits, i.e., age 35 is the last year for males that numbers of potential mates can be increased by newly available 15-year-old females if males may be no more than 20 years older than their mates. Comparison of curve V with the two respective histograms indicates that maximum numbers of potential mates calculated in this waybyage of ego has little influence on the number of marriages contracted at that age. Arrows above the curves in Figure la correspond to the values given as examples in the text above.
In Figure 2, Curves I, II, and IV reflect the overall growth of the population from 1908 to 1966. I t is interesting that the rate of removal of individuals from their respective mating pools by reason of marriage has tended to keep the size of the pools relatively constant for several decades at a time. The only period of appreciable increase of potential mates (Curve V) occurred approximately during the decade 1940-49 when the mean number of marriages per year fell from 2.20 to 1.70. Since 1950 the marriage rate has been 4.23 marriages per year.
The mean number of males exceeds that of females in all years regardless of the restrictions imposed on inclusion. The sex ratio (100 X M/F) for individuals of all ages over all years is 114.83. If all age and agedifferential restrictions are met, the ratio becomes 116.90, and when married individuals are excluded from the calculations it rises to 139.76. This last increase is the consequence of removing equal numbers (through marriage) from already unequal pools.
Goldberg (1967) has calculated the size

of the female potential mate pool for an endogamous community of North African immigrants to Israel. This population is not exactly comparable to Northside in that the number of adults appears to be somewhat smaller (the total population in 1950 was 400, as compared to 490), and in that males average 1.16 years older than their wives, as compared to 4.99. Also, in the Israeli population, young women are not eligible to marry until their older sisters have done so, and Goldberg set the limits of the age-differential of potential mates at one standard deviation about the mean age difference at marriage, rather than at the extremes of the latter distribution. He finds that males have on the average 28.7 available females before the elimination of married individuals. It is not possible to get numbers of single females from the published results of Goldberg's study since these are presented only as percentages of those meeting all age requirements; but since these percentages range from less than 10% to over 90%, the range of numbers is probably between 4 or 5 and 30.
Using all the criteria of eligibility described previously, the mean number of females for the average male over all years in the Northside mate pool is 70.97 before, and 40.79 after, eliminating married individuals; if, as in Goldberg's study, the age differential is set at one standard deviation about the mean age at marriage (husbands 5 ± 6 years older than their wives, or -- 1 to +11), these figures become 44.05 and 27.20 respectively.
One other estimate of numbers of potential mates in populations of less than a thousand was published by Dudley and Allen (1942) wherein a number of older people in two relatively endogamous communities in North Carolina were asked how many young people of the opposite sex they had known well enough to pick a husband or wife from. The answer is given as "around a dozen or

so, with the maximum set at two or three dozen."
AGE OF POTENTIAL MATES
Figure 3a shows the distribution of mean and variance in age of single-female potential mates by age of males. The points plotted represent the observed mean age of wife by age of husband. Since the age limits of potential mates were deliberately set identically to the limits of age at marriage, it is not surprising that the two distributions correspond in some respects, but the mean age of potential mates and mean age at marriage are remarkably close. Unfortunately, there are so few marriages that numbers of spouses in each age class are too small for meaningful statistical testing; but it appears that mean age of potential mates may predict age of spouse fairly well. Figure 3b shows the distribution of age of male potential mates and husbands, by age of females.
FAMILY RELATIONSHIP AND CONSANGUINITY
Table 1 shows mean numbers of females per male by family relationship averaged over all years. First cousins have been broken down into the four types (FBD = fa-

ther's brother's daughter, etc.), whereas grandparent-child and great-grandparentchild relationships, first cousin once removed (1C1R) types, and second-cousin types have been pooled. The excess of parallel cousins (FBD and MSD) which is evident even when age and age-differential are disregarded appears to be chiefly the result of correlation of sex of immigrants. For example, there was a tendency for males from St. Bart to join their brothers in Northside whether or not the latter were married, while females usually immigrated when they could join a married sister. There is some suggestion of the same pattern holding today with regard to visiting between islands. The excess is maintained even after those not of mating age, those outside the age-differential (--5 to +20), and the married have been eliminated. Mean numbers of males available to females are slightly higher, but follow the same pattern as Table 1.
Table 2 shows proportions of the total number of opposite-sexed individuals accounted for by each of the relationships given. As might be expected, proportions of relatives of the same generation (sibs, first

and second cousins) increase as restrictions which limit age and age-differential are applied, while proportions decrease for crossgenerational relationships. The greatest increase in total proportion of potential mates who are related to ego comes when calculations are made on the basis of single persons only. This is to be expected if those who marry are less closely related to each other than are those who are left single. Proportions are little changed with reduction of age-differential limits (--1 to +11).
A convenient measure of relatedness is the coefficient of kinship, which is the probability that alleles of a given locus drawn at random from any two individuals in a population are identical by descent. The inbreeding coefficient is a special case of the coefficient of kinship, the two individuals drawn being limited to parents of ego. The

mean coefficient of kinship (<j>), based here on primary relationships, has been calculated by year and by age for potential mates of those who have married within the community (termed here "endogamous" individuals) and for potential mates of those who have not (termed "nonendogamous"). The latter group includes both those who remain in the community and those who emigrate or marry exogamously. In this case married egos were not eliminated after the year of their marriage as was the practice in previous calculations; criteria for inclusion of opposite-sexed individuals as potential mates were unchanged, however.
Figures 4 and 5 show the mean coefficient of kinship, excluding sibs and lineal relatives, plotted for both groups of male egos and their female potential mates, by calendar year and by age respectively. The

nonendogamous male egos are more closely related to their potential mates than are the endogamous males. This effect is less pronounced previous to the late 1920's when the proportion of immigrants among adults was higher, and it tapers off after 1950 as the nonendogamous group includes a decreasing proportion of men who have actually reached the end of the mating period. The effect is similar, although not so pronounced, when calculations are made between female egos and their male potential mates.
DISCUSSION
From Figures 1 and 2 it can be seen that pools of opposite-sexed individuals are reduced in size by approximately one-half as each increasing restriction is placed on eligibility for inclusion. This indicates the necessity for avoiding a simple demographic definition of availability for mating in small populations. Comparisons of total numbers of the sexes or even of numbers within absolute mating age categories do not give realistic estimates of those actually marriageable. Consideration must be given to relative age and to previous marital status of those whose ages are appropriate for marriage. The method used here has the advantage of being objective and easily applied; it is very likely, however, that the members of the population have additional criteria of eligibility which further reduce the maximum numbers shown here. Nonetheless, it appears that many more endogamous marriages might have been contracted than actually have been and that because of the excess of males no female has lacked the opportunity to marry within the community.
I t is interesting that estimates of mean numbers of female potential mates for Northside, the Israeli population, and the two North Carolina communities are roughly comparable. I t would be useful to have standardized estimates for other small popu-

lations in order to understand the relationship between total population size and numbers of potential mates. Livi (1949) made a number of observations on small isolated populations whose demographic history has been recorded, and he found that those which are of 300-500 individuals may not be self-sustaining and have a high probability of dying out. Analysis of potential mate pools should make it possible to evaluate the demographic and cultural determinants of the extinction process in such populations. The relationships between total population size, potential mate pools, and the geneticist's effective population size would also be interesting to know. I t will be necessary to analyze populations where larger numbers of marriages are available in order to evaluate the effects of potential-mate age distributions on the distributions of marriage age.
There are only 18 marriages of persons who are known to be related as second cousins or closer in the Northside population, and thus it is not possible to test adequately the influence of proportions of related potential-mate types on proportion of consanguineous marriage types. It is possible, however, to learn about marriage patterns with respect to consanguinity if all family relationships of potential mates are taken together. As has been pointed out, the increase in total proportion of potential mates who are related to ego which occurs when married persons are excluded from the calculations (Table 2) implies that those who marry endogamously are more distantly related than those who do not. That this is true can be seen from Table 3, where the mean coefficient of kinship, excluding sibs and lineal relatives, has been calculated over all years for the four combinations of endogamous and nonendogamous male egos and their respective endogamous and nonendogamous female potential mates.
The figures in parentheses represent the percentage of potential mates in each class

who are related as second cousins or closer. All calculations have been made on the basis of primary relationships since these are more likely to be of sociological importance than more distant secondary ones. From Table 3 it appears that endogamous males and females are least closely related and nonendogamous males and females are most closely related. I t also appears that consanguineous mating is avoided within the former class, since the coefficient of kinship of the 143 married men and their wives is less than that for all married men and women taken together (0.004916 or 13% consanguineous marriages). Figures 4 and S show much the same thing in greater detail. However, no attempt has been made to separate the endogamous from the nonendogamous female potential mates with the result that the two sets of curves compare relationships of the two groups of men and approximately the same group of wommen. I t looks very much as though the number of relatives a young person sees among his potential mates has an effect on his remaining in the population. This is likely to have important social and genetic effects on the internal structure of the population and on rates of migration and gene flow.
SUMMARY
A method of analysis is described and applied to a small population, by which potential mates are enumerated by age, calen-

dar year, family relationship, and marital status. When the most restrictive criteria for inclusion in the potential mate pool are applied, i.e., individuals fall within appropriate age and age-differential limits and are not members of ego's nuclear family, it appears that in this population (a) mean age at marriage is not affected by mean numbers of potential mates, but may be a function of their mean age; (b ) neither numbers or sex ratio of potential mate pools are accurately reflected in the total population structure; (c) mean numbers are relatively consistent with estimates of numbers in at least two other small populations; and (d) both males and females who marry endogamously are less closely related to their potential mates than those who do not.
This method should be of considerable utility as further populations are examined for which the necessary pedigree information is available. Many of the questions about minimum population size, extinction, and effective population sizecan be answered with the use of simulated populations. This work is currently under way, as is the analysis of the larger St. Bart population.
