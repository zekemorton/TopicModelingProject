ABSTRACT: Cohort approach is used to disentangle age, period, and cohort effects on maternal mortality in New York State. By comparing various age * period * cohort linear logit models on the logits of maternal mortality rates, we conclude that period and age effects are the dominant influences on maternal mortality, and cohort effect does not contribute as much as we expect after adjustment for age and period. The implications are that, as a set, changes in those temporal variables which cut across cohorts appear to be more important than changes in those variables which distinguish them.

The risk of maternal mortality has undergone a most remarkable transformation within the lifetime of most Americans. From 1917 to 1977 maternal mortality dropped almost 99 per cent, exceeding the large decrease in the death rate at all ages from infectious diseases. During this period, the chance of a pregnant woman dying from pregnancy-related causes went approximately from one in 108 to one in 8,900. Maternal deaths accounted for 12 per cent of all deaths among women of childbearing age in 1917 and less than 1per cent sixty years later (U. S. NCHS Vital Statistics reports).
Given the extremely rapid decline in maternal mortality which took place between 1917and 1977, one would wonder if age patterns of maternal mortality respond only to period influences, so that the experience of a cohort can be described completely by age effects and the effects of the periods its members live through, or if they respond to additional cohort influences as well. This pa-

per attempts to apply cohort approach to offer answers to the underlying motivating question: Did cohort effect apply to maternal mortality during the period 1917-77? It is our intention to disentangle age, period, and cohort effects on maternal mortality. After comparing models for age, period, and cohort effects, we discuss our interpretation.
New York State was selected for two reasons: First, the requisite data on live births and maternal deaths are available since 1917; second, from 1917 to 1956, there were striking downturns in maternal mortality rates both in New York and in the United States generally (see Figure 1). The maternal mortality rates in New York tended to parallel those for the nation and were consistently lower than U.S. rates during this period. However, in 1957, the rate in New York State fell not as rapidly as in the nation and even come to be slightly higher than the U.S. rate. This reversed parallel trend between New York State and U.S. rates continued until 1972. Thus,

their age and parity distributions of birth can be expected to affect their maternal mortality rates, has been investigated by Berry (1977). These two influences on maternal mortality can be referred to as age and cohort effects respectively. Period effects refer to the influence of historical events.
Berry (1976) indicated that "age or aging effect refers to the influence of the biological process of aging and/or to the movement through the age-graded social statuses of the life cycle. Period or historical change effects refer to the impact of historical events which occur at a certain point in time. Cohort or birth cohort membership effects refer to the influences of the differing sets of past experience which characterize different cohorts. Cohort effects are interaction between the impact of historical or environmental events and the age of the persons experiencing these events."
Even though age, period, and cohort effects often have separate influences on period rates, period approach cannot sort the influence of one effect from that of another. Cohort analysis can, under certain conditions, provide separate measure of age, period, and cohort effects '. Several mathematical techniques for obtaining these measures have been developed in the literature of cohort analysis (Blanchard, et al., 1977; Fienberg, et al., 1978; Glenn, 1977; Mason, et al., 1973; Palmore, 1978; Pullum, 1977, 1980; Schaie, 1965; Price, 1974). The measurement of period effects is not too difficult since they have strong influences on maternal mortality. The measurement of cohort effects is more problematic since very large period influences tend to mask whatever cohort may be present. In comparison to period and age effects on maternal mortal-

ity, cohort effects are probably very small (Berry, 1977).
MEASUREMENT OF MATERNAL
MORTALITY
Conventionally, the maternal mortality rate is denned as the number of deaths due to puerperal causes per 10,000 or 100,000 live births. A maternal mortality rate represents approximately the risk of dying as a result of "complications of pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium" (Shryock and Siegel, 1973). The most common puerperal causes of death are infection, hemorrhage, and toxemia. According to Berry (1976), "puerperal causes of death generally are subdivided into direct and indirect causes. Direct causes are produced solely by the experience of pregnancy and childbirth, e.g., hemmorrhage or infection. Indirect causes of maternal deaths are preexisting conditions, e.g., heart disease, diabetes, kidney disease, which would probably not have proved fatal without the additional stress imposed by pregnancy and childbirth."
The maternal mortality computed by the above definition is only a rough measure of the puerperal risk, since the deaths are related to live births instead of pregnancies, for which data are not usually available (Spiegelman, 1968). A true rate of maternal mortality would be defined in terms of total pregnancies (i.e., denominator) regardless of gestation age. This definition theoretically would result in a maternal mortality rate one-fifth below the rate usually determined. However, since reporting of fetal deaths in most vital statistics is restricted to pregnancies of twenty weeks gestation or more, and fetal deaths that occur below twenty weeks gestation are

ternal deaths during these years. These eightfive-yearcohorts are the cohorts of 1898-1902,1903-07,1908-12,1913-17, 1918-22, 1923-27, 1928-32 and 193337. These cohorts will be called the complete cohorts. The period categories can be determined by knowledge of age and cohort membership through the following relationship:
n(period) = n(age) + n(cohort)--1.
METHODOLOGY
We adopt the model-fitting procedure which provides us with parametric models and their goodness-of-fit measures. The advantage of this approach is to present models easy to understand and interpret. Through the selected model (or models), we are able to ascer-

tain the association structure between the variables of interest. In this context, linear logit models utilizing additional diagonal parameters (Goodman, 1972) were employed to analyze the effects of age, period, and cohort simultaneously. The most general logit model under our consideration is as follows:

\o&t(i,j,k) = l

(·) where p^ is the maternal mortality rate introduced earlier and A(l), C(jj and p(k) represent the age, cohort, and period effects at the various levels.
By setting various terms in (1) equal to zero, we obtained different logit models. The parameters in a proposed logit model were estimated by the maximum likelihood method. Cyclic ascent al-

lei argument to Clogg's shows that the inclusion of the inverse-diagonal parameters introduced by the period variable to our age-cohort analysis results in four similar identification constraints. Out of the four, three of them are trivial in the sense that they are required in order to define main effects for the categories of the three variables. The additional fourth one, however, is nontrivial in that the effect of an inverse-diagonal category is set equal to some specified constant. If this inverse-diagonal effect is mistakenly assumed, all of the estimated age, period, and cohort effects will be in error. Clogg (1980) demonstrates how an error in imposing this nontrivial identifying restriction propagates error or bias in all the other effects of the model. For detailed discussion, see Clogg (1980). This problem regarding the specification of the identifying constraints does not concern the two-parameter models (models which contain only two variables).
Due to the linear relationship between age, calendar year, and cohortship, several researchers (Baltes, 1968; Goldstein, 1968; Glenn, 1976) suggest excluding one of these three factors from the model in the cohort analysis. However, we prefer the argument given by Mason et al. (1973) that such a procedure is not necessary and certain variables should be dropped only if they do not seem to have significant effect upon the dependent variable after adjustment for other variables.
The contribution of a variable or variables in explaining the variation existing in the data is measured by the difference in the G2 statistics between the two models with and without the variable or variables in question. The difference is then compared to the percentiles of a chi-square distribution with degrees of

freedom equal to the difference between the degrees of freedom of the two corresponding C^'s. By doing this, we can determine whether the reduction in the fit is significant or not at a given level (for detail in the G^-decomposition, see Fienberg[1980].
RESULTS
The results offittingvarious linear Iogit models to the data are shown in Table 3. The G2, x1, as well as the degrees of freedom are given for each model fitted, the convergence took place within 15iterations under all the models we tried. As a comparison, we also included in Table 3 the 95 percentiles of chi-square distributions with degrees of freedom equal to those of the corresponding G2. Here, we face the same situation as Pullum (1980) did in his fertility study since these models were applied to the population data rather than sample data drawn from the New York State. However, if we consider US. national maternal mortality as the conceptual population and the New York State data as a sample drawn from this population, we are still able to draw inferences regarding the age, period, or cohort effects from these goodness-of-fit statistics.
The results in Table 3 suggest that age, period, and cohort, when included in the models alone, all increase the fit significantly. The results also suggest that both Model (5) and (7) provide adequate fit to the data at the 0.05 level. However, the reduction in G2 by including the cohort variable after adjustment for age and period effects is only 2.69 (=21.34--18.65) which is much too low when compared to the percentiles of a chi-square distribution with six degrees of freedom. Therefore, we chose Model

ably because medical advances were able to control causes of maternal death such as infection, hemorrhage, and toxemia more effectively than indirect causes such as heart disease or diabetes. Since indirect causes are more common among older women, they benefited less from the overall decline in maternal mortality.
The period parameters estimates P(k), plotted against the years in Figure 3, show some monotonic decreasing trend except for P^ which corresponds to 1962 and is slightly larger than the value for the previous period level. This, presumably, is due to the big dip occurring in the 40-44 age group curve given in Figure 2. Due to the fact that there is only one pair of observations (corre-

sponding to the age group 40-44) in the 1977 data and that one of them is zero, the estimate for this year is less precise compared to the rest and is therefore excluded from the discussion and Figure 3. Among the 12 remaining period intervals, the period effects estimates decrease slightly from 9.521 to 9.393 between 1917 and 1932. The decreasing trend picks up speed between 1932 and 1952, during which the estimates range from 9.393 to 6.871. Then, quite^ abruptly this downward trends comesalmost to a halt. Between 1952 and 1967 only minor decreases take place and then another big jump is seen in 1972. The period effects estimates were found to be positively correlated from the asymptotic covariance calculation. This

One possible explanation may lie in the selecting out of higher order births as a factor in the death rate decline and in the possibility that at high mortality levels poor risks are weeded out earlier in their reproductive careers, leaving a hardier cohort to reproduce later in life (Nortman, 1974).
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
A cohort study was invoked in this paper on the logits of maternal mortality rates. The results indicate that cohortship is not a significant explanatory variable to the logits of maternal mortality after adjustment for age and period. Also, adding period dimension after adjustment for age has greater impact per degree of freedom than adding the cohort dimension after adjustment for

age. One possible reason is that cohort effects on maternal mortality are extremely small, particularly in comparison to period effects. The implications of our findings on New York maternal mortality are that, as a set, changes in those temporal variables which cut across cohorts appear to be more important than changes in those variables which distinguish them.
We also referred to specific parametrizations of the selected model and gave interpretations to the parameters in the model. The age *period logit model was chosen to describe the data and the trends across age groups and calendar years were noticed and discussed. This simple model was found to fit the data reasonably well on average, although the fluctuation in the residuals for the

oldest age group (40-44) is slightly higher due to the stochastic variation in diminishing small numbers of maternal deaths and pregnancies in this group.
