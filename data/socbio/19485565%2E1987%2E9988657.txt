ABSTRACT: Mortality rates by age and sex of American Indians living in reservation and nonreservation counties were compared for 1970 and 1978. An apparent overcount in the 1980 census enumeration of American Indians curtails rigorous comparisons, but broad differences can be delineated. The main improvement in American Indian mortality during the decade was in age group 0-4. In 1970, non-reservation death rates were not different from reservation rates. By the end of the decade, non-reservation death rates had diverged downward from reservation deaths. An analysis of 1978 death rates by poverty status showed that non-reservation death rates are sensitive to county poverty level, whereas reservation death rates are not.

Around 1970, age-specific death rates in the United States either began to decline after a plateau in the 1960's (age groups 35-75) or to accelerate their downward trend. Infant mortality rates, which historically have declined faster than other rates, began to decline even faster than in previous decades. Between 1970 and 1980, life expectancy for white males increased by 2.7 years to 70.7 and for white females by 2.5 years to 78.1. The life expectancy improvement for American Indians from 1970to 1980 was even greater: up 6.4 years to 67.1 for males, and up 3.9 years to 75.1 for females.
American Indians1 have a unique history among ethnic groups in America. They maintain distinct non-Western traditions concerning health, the human body, and health care. The persistence and strength of Indian cultural ideas and resultant practices is directly related to

whether they live on reservations or not. Behavioral differences and the material deprivation on reservations ought to be reflected in population mortality rates. Klimas (1982) first investigated whether mortality was different for reservation or non-reservation Indians in 1970. She found no discernible mortality difference between the two groups at that time.
Two trends in the decade of the 1970's are evident for reservation Indians: increasing migration to urban centers, and public health investments to reduce mortality and morbidity. The goal of this paper is to update Klimas's findings to 1978, and to see whether a mortality differential between reservation and non-reservation populations developed as a result of these two trends.

eral government (Hirschfelder, 1982). The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) historically has had jurisdiction on the Indian reservation and under its control rural Indians have lived in poverty "unmatched elsewhere in society" (DHEW, 1974). "In terms of labor force statistics, income and housing, reservation Indians are the most disadvantaged groups in the U.S." (Sorkin, 1978).
Living conditions vary considerably in terms of housing, employment, and degree of rural isolation. In 1981, the Indian Health Service (IHS) spent $69million on attempts to improve housing and sanitation; yet running water, central heating, electricity and indoor plumbing are not always provided in reservation housing, and poverty and unemployment are still too often the way of life, especially for the older Indian (DHEW, 1978c). Apathy and hopelessness are prevalent, and reservation Indians are frequently ambivalent toward government proposals to improve their conditions. For example, Indians are often suspicious of development projects which ignore the Indian system of social relationships and ideas about land use (Stanley, 1978; Barsch and Henderson, 1978).
In 1955, the Indian Health Service (IHS) was removed from BIA jurisdiction and relocated as a unit within the Public Health Service. The IHS meets the criterion of "providing a sufficient density of health services of reasonable caliber" (Orubuloye and Caldwell, 1975), and offers a wide range of curative and preventive health programs, including nutritional and environmental components. Tribal beliefs about death, sickness, and health exist alongside a Western health delivery system and philosophy.

NON-RESERVATION INDIANS
In the 1970's, American Indians voluntarily (and under pressure by the BIA) participated in urban relocation projects which have since 1952 encouraged them to migrate to cities at an increasing rate. Currently about half the Indian population lives in metropolitan areas compared to about 20 per cent in 1960 (DHEW, 1978a). The BIA relocation program provides vocational training, job placement, financial assistance, and counseling services in selected cities. Even so, urbanized American Indians face difficulties in adjusting to city life, often have high secondary-school drop-out rates, face discrimination in employment, and appear to have considerably higher rates of mortality and morbidity from infectious diseases than non-Indians (Sorkin, 1978). Urban Indians tend to live in central city poverty and working class areas (DHEW, 1974).
American Indians living off the reservation usually work and live in primarily non-Indian communities and tend to view the city as an opportunity for economic success (Snyder, 1971). Intermarriage is common among the 10 per cent who are fully assimilated into the middle-class population. Many of the rest maintain contact with the reservation, returning when possible for major ceremonial occasions.
Indians living in urban areas for several years usually hold blue-collar jobs and try to see that their children finish high school (Sorkin, 1978). The majority of newer Indian immigrants to the city live in substandard housing, but of better quality than those on the reservations. Their lives are typical of immigrants from foreign countries and rural blacks from the South. Those who participate in the BIA program are better

off during the first year because they receive relocation assistance from the BIA and health care from the IHS. After that period, general community and statesponsored social service agencies take over if there is a need (DHEW, 1978a).
The reservation, non-reservation social context should differentially affect American Indian mortality rates for two reasons. The standard of living on the reservation is poorer and the sense of hopelessness and frustration is greater. Elderly Indians and those living in rural areas of the reservation are especially deprived. Indians living off the reservation tend to live in better housing, suffer less unemployment, have better nutrition and improved sanitation than do their counterparts on the reservation.
Indians on the reservation feel powerless to institute changes to improve their economic position which would also protect their cultural traditions and the religious significance of their land. Indians who leave the reservations are more optimistic about their futures. They chose to participate in mainstream American life, including Western health care, even though many still identify with their tribes and homelands.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
DEATHS
In the United States, deaths are registered in a standard format by states, which then report their data to the National Center for Health Statistics. These data include the deceased's age, sex, race or ethnicity, and place and cause of death. The Indian Health Service receives in turn from NCHS the records of individuals whose race or ethnic group is listed as American Indian or Alaska Native on the death registration form.

The IHS furnished us with the records of deaths to American Indians from 1969-71 and 1977-79. Three years' worth of data, centering on the two years of interest, are used in order to minimize the effect of yearly random fluctuations of death rates in the small American Indian populations. The three-year average numbers of deaths in the 1969-71 and 1977-79 periods (in 95 counties defined below) were 2,436 and 3,054, respectively.
RESERVATION STATUS
Counties were selected for this study under the following criteria. First, nine of the ten1 states with the highest proportion of Indians on reservations were selected. In those nine states, 95 counties were selected which had at least 400 Indians resident in both 1970 and 1980. This sample of counties includes 37 per cent of American Indians counted in the 1970 census. In 1978, these 95 counties contained 34 per cent of the estimated intercensal Indian population.
Ideally, each deceased or enumerated individual would be classified as either living on a reservation or not. Unfortunately, mortality and population data by ethnic group were not available for geographical units smaller than the county. Individuals are therefore classified as either reservation or nonreservation depending on their county of residence. Counties not wholly within or outside reservations are classified according to the criterion developed by Klimas (1982). If a majority of the county's land area overlaps a reservation it is classified as a reservation county, and vice versa. This classification scheme is fairly robust. Only a handful of counties would have been reclassified under a 90-per-cent area rule either way.
Classification into reservation or

non-reservation counties is necessarily crude. The classification is merely a proxy for reservation-related environmental, economic, and health conditions which may be related to mortality. In addition, there was no way to separate out those Indians who migrate back and forth, over a period of years, between the reservation and the city.
POPULATIONS
The population data used in this analysis to calculate death rates are provided by the 1970 and 1980 censuses. The IHS furnished a special 1970 county-level tabulation of American Indian populations by age and sex. For 1980, comparable county-level data were extracted from published Census Bureau computer tapes. The 1980 Census Bureau data are grouped into broad age intervals, 0-4,5-14,15-64, and 65+ , which are maintained throughout this analysis. The 1978 populations are interpolated county-by-county from 1970 and 1980 counts by assuming a constant intercensal population growth rate.

to be American Indians or Alaska Natives. The intercensal growth rate for the self-reported American Indian population as a whole is an implausible 4.48 per cent.
Inexact population counts affect this analysis in several ways. The actual death rates shown should be interpreted with caution as should other comparison because the extent of the bias is unknown. The death rates for 1978 will be biased downward relative to 1970, because the denominators are inflated. Therefore, the improvement in death rates over the decade is likely to be overstated. Comparisons other than between 1970 and 1978 should be less affected by the relative overcount in 1980.

DATA QUALITY
The census counts of any racial or ethnically-defined group relies on selfreporting by that group. Questions about the validity of population data for American Indians have been raised before (Passel, 1976; Carr and Lee, 1978). The death rates below are based on populations of American Indians which unfortunately are inconsistent between the 1970 and 1980 censuses. In a projection of the 1980 American Indian population made in 1979 (assuming annual intercensal growth of 2.55 per cent), the Indian Health Service underestimated the actual 1980 census count by 17 per cent. The 1980 population shows an overcount relative to 1970 of those claiming

and sex. Because of the overcount of American Indians in 1980 (discussed above), rigorous comparisons of 1970 with 1978 cannot be made. Nevertheless, the table does show that death rates for both males and females in the youngest age group (0-4) have declined from 1970 to 1978, relative to other age groups. Possibly, public health programs and other preventive measures during the 70's have been effective in reducing infant and early childhood mortality.
The comparison of reservation and non-reservation rates is interesting. Chisquare tests indicate that in 1970, the difference between reservation and non-reservation mortality was statistically discernible only for males age 514. On the other hand, 1978 reservation death rates were significantly higher than non-reservation death rates for all groups except females age 5-14. , This finding may be partially due to a greater overcount of Indians off the reservation relative to those on the reservation in 1978. It does appear, however, that non-reservation Indians were at a real health or mortality advantage in 1978, but not in 1970. This finding may reflect greater quality and availability of off-reservation health care in 1978, or other factors. In 1970, non-reservation Indians might have been living closer to the reservations than in 1978, with approximately the same health-care facilities available to them as to reservation Indians. By 1978, non-reservation Indians are a distinct group in terms of death rates. One selection explanation would posit that urbanization programs during the 1970's induced relatively healthier Indians to migrate to the cities. The following section examines in more detail the possible effect of county poverty status in 1978 on mortality.

COUNTY POVERTY LEVEL
Poverty status of individuals may affect their mortality chances substantially because the poor have less access to preventive and curative health information and services. Poor people eat a less nutritious diet, have less education, live in inferior housing, and are more frequently unemployed. In addition, counties of relatively poor people may have trouble as communities in attracting and maintaining high-quality medical-care facilities and may receive fewer governmental services. Thus we sought to examine the effect of county poverty level on mortality rates. Because of the ecological fallacy, no definitive causal interpretation can be attached to this analysis, but it may be suggestive.
County-level poverty status data were available from the 1980 census but not from the 1970 census, so death rates from 1977-79 only are analyzed. Counties were divided into three groups based on the proportion of families living in that county with an income at or below the standard poverty line. The upper quartile had 0-24.8 per cent living in poverty; the middle half, from 24.8 to 42.9 per cent in poverty; and the lower quartile, 42.9 per cent or more below the poverty criterion.
A linear model of age, sex, poverty level, and reservation status and their interactions was fit to the logs of the 1978 death rates. A parsimonious model which fits the data adequately included the main effects plus three interaction terms: age by sex, age by reservation status, and reservation by poverty level.2 No other interactions added significantly to the fit of the model.

shows the predicted death rates by poverty level and reservation status, standardized by age and sex.
The absolute level of the death rates in Table 2 is not as important as the pattern of variation observed. Reservation mortality rates do not vary by poverty level of the county in which the reservation falls, but in every case are higher than the death rates off the reservation. Non-reservation death rates, while lower, are sensitive to the poverty level of the county, and presumably to the poverty level of individuals. This finding suggests that the subsidized health care found on the reservations provides a "health safety net" which is either underutilized or of minimal quality, but which serves all Indians regardless of poverty status. Off the reservation, overall health care and lifestyle factors affecting well-being appear better, but access to them is determined more by market factors.
ACCIDENTAL DEATH
Accidental death is the leading cause of death among American Indians. Broudy and May (1983) found that Navajo accidental death rates were 5.5 times those of the whole United States in the mid-1970's. Table 3 shows the ac-

cidental death rates of American Indians by age, sex, reservation status, and year. In 1970, only males ages 0-14 showed a significantly higher accidental death rate on the reservation than off. By 1978 this difference was virtually eliminated, but middle-aged and older men had higher accidental death rates on the reservation than those in nonreservation counties as did young and middle-aged women. Conditions on Indian reservations are cited as particularly dangerous in terms of motor vehicle accidental mortality (7.1 times the U.S. rate). Carr and Lee (1978) discuss the great distances typically driven on reservations, often on unpaved roads in poor condition. The high incidence of alcoholism increases the risk of death in motor vehicles. Carr and Lee cite the life style of the Navajo, especially males, as contributing to the risk of accidental death. It is possible that off the reservation, accidental mortality would be lower due to modifications in lifestyle as well as less driving.

trates the proportion of deaths due to accidents of all types to males andfemales in 1969-71 and 1977-79, rather than death rates. The proportion of deaths which are accidental was found to be no higher on the reservation than off thereservation, once the differences by year, age, and sex are controlled.3 Around 1970, the peak proportion of accidental deaths was an extraordinary 80per cent formales aged 10-14.

in 1970, a higher proportion of males than females died in accidents.
By the 1977-79 period, the proportion of accidental deaths among males and females had converged considerably. Below age 45, neither sex was clearly more likely to die by accident than the other. Above age 45,a higher proportion of males than females died by accident, as in 1970. Interestingly, the proportion of deaths to infants which are accidental appears to have risen during the decade. This rise reflects the decline over the decade due to nutritional and infectious causes of death, leaving accidents a relatively greater role.

SUMMARY
We raised several questions at the beginning of this paper. Our findings provide some qualified answers. The overall rate of male and female American Indian mortality declined both off and on the reservation between 1970 and 1978. It decreased substantially in the 04 age group and was quite low in the 514 age group. But this downward trend was not experienced by women ages 65+ and by men ages 5-14 and 65 + who lived on the reservation. A mortality differential between reservation and non-reservation developed during the decade. In other words, health status as

measured by mortality rates of reservation Indians lagged further behind that of non-reservation Indians rather than catching up. Moreover, poverty level of county did not affect the mortality rate on the reservation. The mortality rate did show the expected gradient off the reservation, in that the death rate declined as the socioeconomic status of the county increased. Though the death rates on reservations are higher than off reservations, the proportion of deaths from accidental and non-accidental causes is about the same.

to consider differing causes of death in the population, the kind of public health approach necessary, and whether improved curative or preventive health services would have the greatest morbidity and mortality impact. Funds available for intervention are limited and are frequently directed toward those areas in which improvement is likely to be rapid and visible as in the case of infant and childhood mortality.
Our findings for the 95 counties in our sample are similar to those obtained by Broudy and May (1983) in their study of the Navajo tribe. Health services have reduced infant and childhood mortality considerably, but adult Indian mortality rates, particularly on the reservation, remain high. Health services and medical intervention per se are not likely to reduce them much further. According to the Indian Health Service (DHEW, 1982) and several studies (Broudy and May, 1983; Kunitz, 1983), adult Indian mortality rates reflect a high component of accidental deaths, suicides, and deaths due to alcoholrelated causes--rates ranging from twice to twenty-three times those for the total U.S. population.
Evidence increasingly shows that "the major challenge of intervention for future health improvements will be in behavior-oriented health problems" (Broudy and May, 1983). The provision of health services alone can go only so far in reducing mortality. Vaccinations cannot miraculously create jobs, antibiotics cannot cure abrogation of treaties, and health education cannot instill meaning into a meaningless existence. Indian children now have a much higher chance to survive to adulthood than they had 25 years ago. but compared to the general population and to urban Indians, the material standard of life on

many reservations remains bleak, and adult mortality is high. Despite pockets of improved social and economic conditions, Indians on reservations face more limited education and job opportunities and have poorer housing and sanitary facilities. As recently as fiscal year 1980, 12.9 per cent of rural Indians were without sewer service (personal communication, Environmental Health, IHS).
The lower material standard of living on the reservation (DHEW, 1974) may be directly responsible for the higher mortality observed for reservation Indians. Mortality rates may be indirectly affected because the reservation provides a haven for those who either cannot adapt to city life or who do not want to give up their tribal identity. In the context of white American society, the American Indian is usually a marginal member both on the reservation and off. Many Indians try both to maintain their Indian identity and become part of mainstream white society. Perhaps it is the stress involved in attempts to reconcile an Indian value system with that of an industrial society that underlies the high adult mortality rates we found in this study.
Our findings also may be the result of a selection process whereby healthier Indians migrate from the reservation. It is also plausible to argue that the lifestyle and living conditions of nonreservation Indians more closely approximate those of other urban Americans. Thus their death rates and causes of death would more closely reflect the patterns of national decline of adult mortality observed during the 1970's. Klimas's (1982) results support this position. She found that the causeof-death structure for non-reservation adult Indians more resembled that of whites than of reservation Indians.
