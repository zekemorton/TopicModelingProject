ABSTRACT: Existing data linking testosterone (T) and aggression in human adult males are surprisingly tenuous. In one of the few studies based on adolescent males, Olweus et al. (1988) demonstrated strong relationships between concurrent measures of T and aggression. However, the conclusions that could be drawn regarding developmental change were limited. Using data from a three-year panel study of 100 adolescent males (ages 12 to 13 at study entry), we examined whether there are significant relationships between concurrently collected measures of T and self-ratings of aggression, and whether the dramatic pubertal rise in T predicts subsequent change in aggression ratings. Panel analyses incorporating concurrent, lagged, and change measures found few significant relationships between aggression and T or pubertal development. The general absence of T/aggression relationships is discussed in the context of other empirical findings, the aggression measures used, and prepubertal differentiation on aggression.

A causal link between testosterone relations that are close to zero (e.g.,

aggression groups, defined either by histories of extremely violent crimes or aggressive behavior in prison, do not consistently yield significant differences, nor are there reliable patterns of correlations across studies between T and aggression measured with selfreport inventories, external raters, or records of behavior in prison (see Meyer-Bahlburg, 1981, and Archer, 1991, for reviews of this literature).
During adolescence, males experience a ten- to twenty-fold increase in T (Faiman and Winter, 1974; Knorr et al., 1974; Lee et al., 1974). The coincidence of this dramatic pubertal rise in T with the deviant or aggressive behavior that is seen in some individuals suggests the possibility of an "activation" effect of T. Only a few studies have investigated the relationship between aggression and T in human male adolescents. Susman et al. (1987), using a sample of 9- to 14-year-old male and female adolescents, found no relationships between adolescents' T levels and maternal ratings of the adolescents on the attributes Delinquent, Aggressive, Rebellious, or Nasty. A subsequent report (Inoff-Germain et al., 1988), using the same sample but different aggression measures, also found no relationship between T and adolescents' expressions of anger and attempts to control or defy their parents during videotaped family interactions on problem-solving tasks.1 Although this sample was studied using a panel design, no models incorporating changes in T or lagged hormone effects have been reported.
1Each set of analyses yielded a few significant relationships with less potent androgens. However, patterns varied by aggression measure, hormone, and sex of subjects.

Probably the best known work on hormone/aggression relationships in human adolescent males is that by Olweus and his colleagues (Olweus et al., 1980; 1988). Applying path analysis techniques to longitudinal behavioral data from 58 normal adolescent males (average age of 16 at the time of testosterone measurement), Olweus demonstrated that plasma testosterone in Grade 9 is a significant predictor of Grade 9 Provoked Aggressive Behavior (as measured by self-report on the Olweus Multi-faceted Aggression Inventory--OMAI), even when level of pubertal development, child rearing patterns relevant to aggressive behavior, and antecedent measures of provoked aggressive behavior at Grade 6 are taken into account. These T/ aggression relationships are impressive, because they are based on a reasonably large sample of normal adolescents, and the analyses control for pubertal development, prepubertal levels of aggression, and several antecedent social variables relevant to aggressive behavior. However, as the authors point out, the boys in their sample were already highly differentiated on aggressive behavior prior to the pubertal rise in T. Grade 9 Provoked Aggression correlated at 0.54 with Provoked Aggression at Grade 6, before the pubertal rise in T for most boys. Thus, aggressiveness at Grade 9 does not "depend on circulating levels of T at puberty for this appearance" (Olweus et al., 1988, p. 270).
Similar assessments taken on a sample of 40 delinquent adolescent males (the 58 normals served as controls for the delinquent sample) produced weaker relationships with self-ratings on the OMAI than were found for the

10

control sample (Mattsson et al., 1980). Further, T was not correlated with any aggression ratings that were made by institutional staff or that were included in psychiatric evaluations of the delinquent sample.
A recent study (Gladue, 1991) used a modified version of the OMAI to examine relationships among testosterone, estradiol, sexual orientation, and aggressiveness in a sample of heterosexual and homosexual males and females ranging in age from their mid20's to mid-30's. The findings of interest here were that total T and estradiol were each significantly correlated with OMAI measures of physical and verbal aggression for the 40 male subjects. Total T was also significantly correlated with impulsiveness, and estradiol was significantly correlated with impatience. Interestingly, free T, the biologically active component of total T, was not significantly correlated with any of the measures for males, despite the 0.80 correlation between assays of total and free T. Although this replication of a relationship between total T and physical/verbal aggression as measured in the OMAI is impressive, the absence of significant relationships with free T is puzzling.
In sum, findings reported to date in the human literature on T/aggression relationships are equivocal. Most studies have used small samples, and when significant relationships between T and aggression have been found, it is often only for a small subset of the aggression measures included in the study, or when the data are examined in one particular way. Some of the most interesting findings to date, those of Olweus and colleagues using adolescent samples, are limited in the conclusions that

can be drawn about developmental change. Use of T-values measured at the same time as the ninth-grade measures of aggression demonstrates only that causality is plausible. The presence of a significant T/aggression relationship after antecedent social factors and earlier levels of aggression have been controlled for strengthens a causal interpretation. However, the dependent variable in the path analysis--Grade 9 aggression--should be interpreted as equivalent to a change in aggression between grades 6 and 9. In essence, the ninth-grade T value is being used to predict a change in aggression that occurred before the T measurement. The P value of 0.195 reported for the path between Provoked Aggression measured at Grade 6 and T measured at Grade 9 suggests the possibility that experience of aggressive encounters may influence later T levels (Archer, 1991). Because humans are already well-differentiated on aggression prior to the hormonal changes of puberty, and because of the possibility that experience may affect hormones, a stronger argument for hormonal causality must include a demonstration that there are postpubertal increases in aggression that coincide with, or are subsequent to, pubertal increases in testosterone. A panel study of males in early puberty should provide a particularly convincing design to test the relationship between increases in T and aggressive behavior. This paper examines that possibility.
Using data from a three-year panel study of 100 early adolescent males, we explore several aspects of the relationship between T and aggression. First, we examine whether there is a signifi-

hair, Tanner stage ratings of pubic hair and genital growth (Tanner, 1962), and testicular volume. All nurses were trained in the exam protocol by the same trainer. Boys whose exams were conducted in the home setting often refused to allow the nurse to assess testicular volume and Tanner stage. In these instances, the nurse instructed the subject in the use of the orchidometer, and the subject performed the ratings/measurements himself. At the first exam, 70 per cent of subjects refused to allow the nurse to make these ratings. Among subjects who allowed the nurses to assess Tanner stage and testicular volume, self-ratings and RN ratings correlated at 0.80. Given this high correlation, exam data that included self-ratings instead of RNratings for these items were not distinguished in the construction of exambased pubertal factor scores discussed below.
Blood Samples.--As part of the semiannual physical examination, three blood samples were collected at 15-minute intervals using an indwelling catheter and heparin lock. To address the issue of pulsatile release, the samples were pooled to achieve a "biological average." Samples were kept cool in the field and centrifuged within 4 hours of collection. Plasma was separated and stored at -80 C until assay. A 5 ml saliva sample was also collected during the exam. However, saliva assay data are not reported here. All physical specimens were collected between 3:00 and 9:00 p.m. Between these hours the diurnal rhythm curve for T is nearly flat (Butler et al., 1989). The average difference between collection times for different rounds of data

collection within individual boys was an hour.
Hormone Assays. --Plasma samples were assayed for testosterone (T) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Testosterone assays were performed using the Diagnostic Products Corporation 1125 Coat-a-Count kit; SHBG assays were performed using the Farmos Diagnostica 1125 kit. All samples were assayed in duplicate and, for a subset of specimens, were cross-validated against values generated from two other labs. (See Halpern and Udry, 1992 for a description of the validation process.)
Analyses to be reported here use total testosterone, both for simplicity and to parallel the analyses reported by Olweus et al. (1980) and most other studies in this content area. However, use of an approximation of a Free Testosterone Index (FTP, T/SHBG x 100), a unit-free ratio of T and SHBG, produces similar results and conclusions.
Pubertal Development -- Pubertal development is indexed by a factor score based on items from the nurses' exam. The following items were submitted to a principal components analysis: Tanner stage of pubic hair and genital growth, testicular volume, and presence and density of axillary, facial and leg hair. The analysis was performed on a pooled data set that combined all five rounds of physical exams and generated a single factor. Pooling five rounds allowed for the generation of factor scores based on a wider range of physical development. An individual's score thus reflects his position relative to the physical development of the entire sample over two years.

Because only self-ratings of physical development were obtained in the third year follow-up, any analyses requiring a pubertal score from the third year use factor scores based on a subject's self-ratings were obtained as part of the semiannual questionnaires.2 A validity study of these self-assessment items comparing males' self-assessment factor score with pediatricians' assessment factor score yielded a correlation of 0.72 (Morris and Udry, 1980). Subject-based pubertal scores for the present study were constructed parallel to those based on the nurses' ratings. However, scores from subjects' self-ratings span a three-year period. Correlations between nurse- and subject-based pubertal factor scores at Rounds 1-5 ranged from 0.71 to 0.84.
RESULTS
OMAI SCALES
One of our purposes is to replicate the findings of Olweus in a different sample of adolescent males of similar age. Therefore, it will be helpful to compare the physical characteristics of the two samples. Because the OMAI items were administered only at the final round of data collection in the present study, we will analyze these variables separately from the other aggression indices with repeated measurements. Table 1 lists descriptive information for Olweus' sample of 58 normal adolescents and parallel information for the 82 subjects in our sample who completed the final round of

data collection. The final round (end of year 3) is the most comparable point to the hormone results reported by Olweus. Subjects in the present sample are similar in age to the subjects in the Olweus sample. However, a greater percentage of boys in the Olweus sample are at Tanner Stage 5 for both genital growth and pubic hair development. The Olweus sample also has a higher mean T level, although this is at least partly due to the collection of blood samples in the morning versus afternoon and evening collection in the present study. Assay differences may also contribute to differences in means. Although the samples are close in terms of chronological age, the present sample, at the final round of data collection, is less physically developed than that of Olweus and includes a few subjects whose afternoon T levels are still in the prepubertal range.
Table 2 lists correlation coefficients between OMAI scales completed at Round 6, and T and pubertal development measured at the same and earlier rounds. Correlations between T and OMAI scales reported by Olweus et al. (1980) are also listed. In contrast to the 1980 Olweus results, correlations between concurrent measures of T and each OMAI scale in the present sample are small and nonsignificant. Correlations with concurrent measures of pubertal development are essentially zero.
The nonbold correlations in Table 2 reflect various lag times between measures of T or pubertal development and the OMAI scales completed at Round 6. All of the coefficients using T are negative, and three are statistically significant at the 0.05 level or better. About half of the correlations

with pubertal development are also negative, but all are close to zero. A review of the plots of the T correlations revealed that five subjects who rated themselves as very high in aggression at Round 6 and had started the study at very low levels of T were contributing

heavily to the negative correlations with early T values. Using early rounds of T, there are no high T/high aggression subjects to "balance" the low T/high aggression subjects, and therefore a negative relationship is generated. As the low T/high aggression

16

subjects increase in T over the course of the study, the negative relationship between T and the OMAI Round 6 measures attenuates. Although we understand the attenuation of the negative relationship over time, we cannot explain why there are no boys with high OMAI scores at Round 6 who were relatively high in T at Round 1. We therefore leave these negative relationships uninterpreted.3
In summary, we have not replicated significant positive relationships between concurrent measures of T and OMAI scores in our sample. Concurrent measures of pubertal development are also unrelated to scores on these scales. Correlations between T measured 1 to 3 years prior to the OMAI scales are relatively small and consistently negative; most are nonsignificant.

OVER TIME
Except for the OMAI scales, we have aggression measures at six-month intervals for two years, and a sixth set of measures at the end of Year 3. To examine the relationship between concurrent measures of T/pubertal development and aggression over time, we performed repeated measures Analyses of Variance (ANOVA) on each aggression measure using T or puber-
3It is unlikely that we would have found positive sizable relationships between early measures of T and Round 6 OMAI measures. In order to produce a positive relationship with T measured 2 to 3 years before the aggression measures, all boys who were prepubertal (i.e., boys who were low in T) at the early rounds of the study would have to be low in aggression at the end of the study. This pattern is unlikely, given the differentiation on aggression that exists prior to puberty.

tal development as a time-varying covariate.
A summary of the results of the repeated measures ANOVA's is listed in Table 3. Results of other models to be discussed below are also included in the table. Means and standard deviations for all the variables at each round are listed in Table 4. Scores for four of the eight aggression measures (Argues, Argue with Non-Family, Trouble at School, Damage Property) changed significantly over time. However, as can be seen in Table 4, the mean scores do not systematically increase or decrease from round to round.4
Significance tests of concurrently collected T values were not significant for any aggression measures at the 0.05 level. Two tests of the time*T interaction were significant: the relationships between concurrent levels of T and the variables Argues and Trouble at School change over time. Examination of single-degree-of-freedom regression terms for each aggression measure showed that the signs of the regression coefficients varied across rounds.
Tests of pubertal development were significant only on the variables Trouble at School and Damage Property; over all rounds, boys who were more pubertally developed rated themselves as more likely to get into trouble and reported more instances of property damage. For the variable Argues, the effects of pubertal development varied significantly over time. In contrast to the relationship with T over time, the
4Because not all subject have complete T data across rounds, the N for testosterone models is smaller than the pubertal development models. Therefore, results of the significance test of change in the aggression measures over time vary slightly between the T and pubertal development models.

relationship between pubertal development and Argues was consistently positive over rounds, but the strength of the relationship varied in nonsystematic ways over time.
In summary, concurrent measures of both testosterone and pubertal development are related to the variable Argues. However, the direction of T effects varies by round, while the relationship with pubertal development is consistently positive. Pubertal development is also related to getting in Trouble at School and incidents of Damaging Property, and these relationships are relatively stable over all six rounds.
RELATIONSHIPS AMONG LAGGED
MEASURES OF T, PUBERTAL
DEVELOPMENT, AND AGGRESSION
OVER TIME
ANOVA models on each of the eight aggression measures were repeated incorporating, in separate models, six-month and one-year lag periods between measures of T or pubertal development and measures of aggression. Because rounds 5 and 6 are separated by one year, Round 6 data were not included in the six-month lag models.
All tests of T were nonsignificant. However, six-month lag models showed significant relationships between pubertal development and Argue with Non-family, Trouble at School and Damage Property. The regression coefficients for pubertal development were positive in each case. Models using one-year lag periods also showed a significant relationship between pubertal development and Damage Property, and a marginal relationship with Fights; both relation-

ships were positive. Pubertal development was consistently and positively related to Argues, but again the size of the relationship varied nonsystematically across rounds.
In summary, no lagged relationships with T were significant for any aggression variable. Pubertal development is a significant predictor of Damage Property in both six-month and oneyear lag models, as it was in models using concurrent measures. Boys who are more physically developed report more property damage incidents six months to one year later.
RELATIONSHIPS AMONG CHANGES IN T,
PUBERTAL DEVELOPMENT, AND
AGGRESSION OVER TIME
A parallel set of ANOVA's was run that examined whether changes in T or pubertal development predicted change in aggression, and whether this relationship varied over time. Two sets of analyses to test concurrent change relationships were run. One set examined whether six-month changes in T or pubertal development predicted sixmonth changes in aggression. The second set examined whether changes in T or pubertal development over oneyear periods predicted changes in aggression for concurrent one-year periods.
Changes in T were not significant in six-month change models. However, T change over one-year periods was significantly and positively related to concurrent one-year changes in the variable Fights and ACL Aggression Scale. There were also marginal Time*T change interactions on the Aggression scales of the ACL and PRF. For both scales, the direction of the relationship varied over the one-year time periods.

Pubertal change was not significant in any of the six-month change models; a single model testing one-year change scores was significant. In this case there was a negative relationship between change in pubertal development and change in the PRF Aggression scale.
A final set of models was run that examined the relationships over time between six-month changes in T or pubertal development and six-month changes in aggression that were lagged by six months. (Testing, for example, whether the change in T between rounds 1 and 2 predict aggression change between rounds 2 and 3, etc.) No relationships with pubertal change were found in these lagged change models. There were two marginal interactions between time and T change on Argue with Non-family Member and Damage property. For both variables the direction of the relationships varied across periods of change.
In summary, models incorporating concurrent one-year change periods yielded significant, positive relationships between T and the variables Fights and the ACL Aggression Scale. There was a negative relationship between one-year change in pubertal development and the PRF Aggression Scale. Change models based on sixmonth periods of concurrent and lagged change failed to yield substantive and consistent findings for either T or pubertal development.
DISCUSSION
The present design, with repeated measurements of T and aggression during the pubertal period, should provide an ideal context for assessing the influence of pubertal increases in T on ag-

gressive behavior in adolescent males. The results provide little evidence of a systematic relationship between aggression and concurrent or earlier measures of T. Further, changes in T showed little relationship with either concurrent or lagged changes in aggression. These findings are based exclusively on self-ratings. However, results using one-time maternal ratings of subjects on the items Fights and Argues (analyses not shown) were consistent in showing no relationship between aggression and proximal values ofT.
Pubertal development, like T, was unrelated to most of the aggression measures. The one exception is the variable Damage Property. In this case, both concurrent and earlier measures of pubertal development were positively related to reports of this behavior. The strength of the relationship did not vary significantly over the time period covered by the study.
The general absence of relationships between T/pubertal development and aggression is perhaps not surprising, given that we have no evidence of a systematic increase in aggression during the three years of the study. Although a few measures show significant change over time, in each case the change appears to reflect fluctuation rather than systematic increase. In addition to the absence of systematic change in the average level of aggression, individuals tend to retain their "position," relative to others, over time. With three exceptions, correlations between aggression measures separated by three years were around 0.50, a figure similar to the 0.54 coefficientreported by Olweus et al. (1980) for Provoked Aggression at grades 6

and 9. Correlations for the variables Argues, Fights and Trouble at School over three years were in the 0.30's.
It is possible that there are pubertal changes in aggressiveness that our measures have failed to tap. Although the aggression measures used here are probably comparable, and in some cases are identical, to those used in other studies, they may not be ideal for tapping developmental change. More concrete measures such as objective records of aggressive incidents or observational ratings of subjects in provocative situations may be better indicators of subjects' increased capacities to respond aggressively in contexts that are meaningful to them. It is possible that a different set of aggression indices, measured over time, would yield significant relationships between pubertal changes in T and aggressive behavior, and possibly a broader range of relationships with pubertal development.
The likelihood that the overall pattern of our findings is limited to these particular measures, however, should be evaluated with two considerations in mind. First, the relative stability in aggression suggested by the present data is consistent with other evidence that some aspects of aggressive behavior may be stable or even decrease during early adolescence for normal samples (Achenback and Edelbrock, 1981; Simmons and Blyth, 1987; Cairns et al., 1989). Except for individuals who are already troubled as children, it is unclear that there are meaningful increases in aggression (excluding recklessness or deviant behavior that does not involve actual aggressive elements) during adolescence for most individuals (Buchanan et al., 1992 ). In his 1979

review of longitudinal studies of male aggressive reaction patterns as measured by external raters, Olweus concluded that "the across-time stability of aggressive behavior was not much lower than that typically found in the intelligence domain" (Olweus, 1979, p. 872). The longitudinal data of Cairns et al. (1989) also indicated highly reliable individual differences over a six-year period. Although this stability over time does not necessarily allow one to predict individual behavior across particular situations (Olweus, 1979), it does suggest that systematic increases in aggressive behavior within individuals during adolescence is not the norm.
It has been suggested that the appearance of a normative increase in violence at adolescence may be due to already aggressive individuals who have better ability and opportunity to injure others (Cairns et al., 1989). If individuals are already welldifferentiated on aggression during childhood, and if most do not show systematic increases in aggression during or shortly after the pubertal rise in T, then pubertal changes in T are unlikely to play a direct, fundamental role in determining aggressive behavior for most individuals. The role of pubertal development may be one of offering better physical ability to express already existing aggressiveness.
A second consideration in evaluating the present findings is that they are generally consistent with those of other investigations. Most studies that have found T/aggression relationships have been based on very small, and sometimes highly selected samples. Even in these cases, demonstrated relationships may be limited to a subset of

aggression measures or to a single type of data analysis. The few studies using larger samples of normals have tended to find relatively small, scattered relationships.
There are instances of significant, positive relationships between concurrent levels of T and selected aggression measures in the present data. For example, at the initial round of data collection at early adolescence, there are significant, positive relationships of about 0.30 between T (and/or the Free Testosterone Index) and fighting behavior as indexed by incidents in the past six months or as a more global rating. In addition, one-year changes in T are significantly and positively related to one-year changes in the variable Fights. However, examination of T/ aggression relationships over time indicate that most of the relationships selected from particular points in time do not persist over time, nor are they reflected in within-subject analyses using concurrent, lagged, or T-change measures. Significant relationships in panel models are, as in other studies using a

single round of measurement, limited to one or two variables within a single time frame of change.
Theoretically, T could affect aggressive behavior either through the organizational effects of prenatal exposure or through activational effects caused by pubertal increases in the hormone. Available evidence regarding the possible influence of prenatal androgens on aggression in humans is limited, both in terms of quantity and method. What is available is mostly negative, though hardly conclusive (Archer, 1991). If there are meaningful behavioral effects of pubertal T, they may likely be contingent on the level of prenatal exposure. It is possible that any effects of pubertal changes in T on aggressive behavior would be apparent only when prenatal organizational effects can be taken into account. If this is the case, repeated assessment of hormones, including measures from both the prenatal and pubertal periods, would be necessary for a more complete assessment of hormonal contributions to aggressive behavior.
