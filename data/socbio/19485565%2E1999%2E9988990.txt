ABSTRACT:This study examines data from Native Ontario reserve residents (Embree, 1993) and a sample from the Ontario Health Survey Supplement (1990-91) in order to compare and contrast the importance of family attributes such as parent-child attachment to Native and Non-native patterns of drug and alcohol useonset. Proportional Hazards modeling (Cox, 1972) wasemployed to identify factors associated with therisk and timing of onset of alcohol and illicit drugs for bothcultural groups. For both Natives and Non-natives alike, and considering both drinking and drug use onset together, agecohort predominates as a risk factor, with youngest groups at greatest risk, and especially in thecase of drug useother than alcohol. For themodel of drug usetiming, ageof alcohol use onset is the second best predictor for Natives, although its effect is still apparent, albeit weaker, in thecase of Non-natives. Asfor family characteristics, a number of factors emerge as determinants of risk and depend, in part, on the cultural group and the substance under consideration. Consistent with attachment theory's prediction about the universal applicability of the need for close parent-child relations (Bowlby, 1969), the findings for both Natives and Non-natives alike point to the salience of psychosocial attachment and other indicators of family functioning in affecting early onset drinking and drug use, behaviors well-recognized to lead to potentially adverse mental and physical health consequences as well as to negative social outcomes.

Literature on substance use patterns reveals a variety of characteristics which may influence the risk of drug and alcohol use onset, including aspects of family functioning, along with a number of other environmental, biological, and psychological influences. A substantial amount of research on consequences of poor family functioning suggests that, irrespective of specific cultural traits, family environment variables such as parental mental health and patterns of substance use, the occurrence of child sexual mistreatment, along with other measures of parental ability and competence, may all affect children's risk of alcohol and drug use initiation. Parental

alcohol or drug problems (Black et al., 1986; Famularo et al., 1986; Famularo et al., 1992; Hernandez, 1992; Worobec et al., 1990; Miller et al., 1993; Blankfield, 1990); childhood sexual victimization (Yellowlees and Kaushik, 1994; Windle et al., 1995; Walker et al., 1993; Goodale and Stoner, 1994; Hussey and Singer, 1993; Swett and Halpert, 1994; Fullerton et al., 1995; Fox and Gilbert, 1994; Bean, 1993); parental mental problems such as depression (Wills and Shiffman, 1985); parental unemployment (Conger et al., 1991); family dissolution due to separation or divorce (Fergusson et al., 1993; Fergusson et al., 1994; Stoker and Swadi, 1990); and the

quality of the parent-child affective relationship (Black et al., 1986; Mian et al., 1994) have all been linked empirically with the risk of developing problem drinking and other behaviors such as illicit drug use (Vaillant, 1994).
From among the various nonfamily environmental or social influences, peer risk factors have also been cited as important determinants of the onset and use of alcohol and other drugs (Blackson and Tarter, 1994; Dupre et al., 1995; Swaim et al., 1989). However, it is also recognized that family influences underlie decisions about peer associations. Fundamental problems such as poor family conditions tend to increase the chances of associations with others oriented towards problem behaviors such as drug use involvement (Oetting et al., 1989).
Reviewing research from a variety of different cultures (Zitzow, 1990), Heath (1998) argues for the universal importance of close affective ties with parents in affecting a wide variety of outcomes such as academic performance, psychological wellbeing, juvenile delinquency, and substance abuse. In general, children having viable relationships with parents are less likely to become involved with drugs and drugoriented peers (Coombs et al., 1991). Indeed, much cross-cultural research has produced findings consistent with the claim that there are certain universal truths about human nature which involve common responses to important stimuli (O'Hara, 1995; Triandis, 1993).
One such universal truth is the need for attachment in intimate relationships according to the theory of psychosocial attachment proposed by Bowlby (1969). In the literature on family functioning, attachment is defined as a strong affectional bond between caregiver and child that af-

fords the child a sense of security and lays the foundation for further attachment behavior later in life (Bowlby, 1969).
Individuals lacking a sense of parental attachment will tend to be anxious and insecure, making later peer attachments and committed relationships more problematic (Bowlby, 1989). In general, developmental pathways of individuals are tied to their attachment experience with the primary caregivers (usually parents) early in life. Negative responses to a lack of secure attachment may occur throughout life, especially in stressful situations or periods of transition, such as adolescence. Indeed, poor parental attachment has been associated with a number of unfavorable life events such as problematic parenting later in life (Tayler et al., 1995); violence and aggression (Green, 1996); personality disorders (Fonagy et al., 1995); poor love attachment as adults (Pistole, 1995); promiscuity (Walsh, 1995); low academic achievement (Cutrona et al., 1994); perpetration of sexual abuse (Alexander, 1992); and substance abuse (Crittenden, 1995). Walsh (1995) finds that, consistent with the expectations of attachment theory, the experience of reliable and supportive family relations is associated with a lower susceptibility to drug use involvement. Moreover, among all available predictors, Walsh's (1995) results indicate that parental attachment has the most powerful influence on the propensity toward drug use.
According to attachment theory's universality claim, pathological outcomes like early substance use onset in response to poor parent-child relations should be observed regardless of cultural context since the need for intimate attachment in primary groups such as the family, as initially argued by Cooley (1962), is said to be culturally invariant. We seek to test empirically attachment theory's claim about cultural

universality in basic psychosocial processes like parent-child bonding by comparing different cultural groups in Canada--Natives and Non-natives--for the importance of family attachment variables for the timing of alcohol and drug use initiation. On the basis of attachment theory expectations, we also predict that individuals experiencing successful attachment with parents during childhood will be less likely to engage in deviant or illegal behaviors such as under-age drinking and use of illicit drugs than those who failed to experience successful relations with parents.
With the exception of the study by Gfellner and Hundleby (1991) on the drug use patterns of a school population of youth in Manitoba, no previous research has tested explicitly the impact of family attachment variables on the risk of substance use among Canadian Natives or examined cross-cultural differences in these relationships. In addition, although an impressive number of recent studies have examined familial factors and substance use outcomes (Smart et al., 1990; Barnes et al., 1986; Blackson and Tarter, 1994; Foxcroft and Lowe, 1991; Grichting and Barber, 1989; Peterson et al., 1994; Worobec et al., 1990; McKenna and Pickens, 1981; Latham and Napier, 1992), few have utilized large general population or nontreatment samples as we do here.
Available evidence about substance misuse and dependency within the Ontario Native Canadian population appears to parallel what has already been established about many Native American groups (e.g., Brown et al., 1992-93; Okwumabua and Duryea, 1987; Grobsmith, 1989; Gutierres et al., 1991; Hughes and Dodder, 1984; May, 1982; Oetting et al., 1989; Beauvais, 1992; Lujan et al., 1989)--the presence of severe problems for a substantial segment

of these populations (Merskey et al., 1988; Liban and Smart, 1982). Reports on patterns of substance use among Native adolescents in Manitoba tell us that Native youth are more likely than their Nonnative contemporaries to use a variety of drugs or to use them with greater intensity (Gfellner and Hundleby, 1991).
The importance of our study is premised on the need to analyze in more depth the determinants of substance use among Natives and to distinguish any identifiable features of risk from those of the general population. Additional research on Canadian Natives' alcohol and drug use patterns and how these might differ from those of the general population would help to inform the most successful prevention and treatment strategies for a group which appears to suffer heavily from a variety of drug-related health, family, and other social problems (Embree and De Wit, 1997).
Many of the above-cited family influences are thought to involve a genetic component. Behaviors such as child abuse, for instance, may be transmitted genetically as a proclivity towards aggression or impulsiveness. The potential genetic impact of parental substance abuse on offspring's use patterns has been examined in a number of studies including those by Bierut et al. (1998) and Merikangas et al. (1998). According to Merikangas et al. (1998, p. 973), "there is increasing evidence that substance use disorders are familial and that genetic factors explain a substantial degree of their familial aggregation." The question of racially-determined genetic differences in susceptibility to drug or alcohol addiction appears to be more controversial, with the few up-to-date studies dealing specifically with North American Indians yielding mixed results (e.g., Barthwell, 1995; Wall et al., 1996; Garcia-Andrade et al., 1997; Goldman

et al., 1998). More complete answers to these questions depend on the availabUity of clinical data and are therefore beyond the scope of our study. Instead, we focus on the impact of psychosocial influences thought to arise from family membership.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
For comparative purposes, one sample consists of a random sample of adults collected from a Native Ontario community and the other, a random subsample of the adult population from the 1990-91 Ontario Mental Health Survey Supplement (OHSSUP). The data on the Native population are based on a simple random sample of 876 adults ages 19 and over from a Native Ontario community with a total household population of approximately 1,200 (Embree, 1993). One adult respondent was chosen at random from within each household. The overall response rate for the survey was about 72 per cent. The questionnaire contains a large number of items pertaining to substance use beliefs and practices, as well as a number of questions about the respondent's family life while growing up. Females account for approximately 70 per cent of the sample due to higher non-participation rates among males who were more likely to be absent from the home for a variety of reasons.
Data for the general population were obtained from the 1990-91 Ontario Mental Health Survey Supplement (OHSSUP), a stratified, multi-stage area probability sample of the household population ages 15 and older. Excluded from this group are residents of Native reserves, prison inmates, foreign service personnel, and residents of remote areas. The original sample represents 9,128 persons ages 19 and older randomly selected from the

household interview portion of the 1990 Ontario Health Survey (OHS). The final response rate for the survey was 76.5 per cent. The OHSSUP contains detailed information on patterns of alcohol and other substance use as well as a wide range of demographic and socioeconomic characteristics pertaining to the respondent's childhood home environment.
To yield more meaningful tests of significance, we applied sample weights to the data and rescaled them to equal the actual number of cases in the sample. Further adjustment for an overall study design effect (DEFF = 2.2)1 resulted in a sample size of 6,154. Of this number, 3,655 cases were randomly selected for analysis. This subsample was generated in order to yield more similar sample sizes for the two groups under study while, at the same time, attempting to compensate for the lower relative prevalence of certain behaviors such as illicit drug use in the general population. Additional descriptive characteristics of the two samples are shown in Table 1.
As already noted, the age at which individuals begin consuming either alcohol or drugs strongly predicts more serious negative consequences later in life, including physical health consequences for the user (Soderstrom, 1994; Berman and Atkinson, 1994) and for unborn children (Conry, 1990; Harris et al., 1995; Lamanna, 1982; May, 1991), as well as a host of interrelated social problems, such as disrupted family relations, depression, criminal behavior,
1DEFF refers to "Design Effect" which reflects the relative magnitude of the standard error of key measures obtained with the given sampling design compared to the standard error obtained with Simple Random Sampling (SRS), which is considered as a standard. Therefore, DEFF values greater than one signify that the sample variance with the given design is larger than would be obtained were SRS sampling employed. This, in turn, indicates lower sampling precision relative to SRS.

child abuse, and substance abuse disorder (De Wilde et al., 1994; Lee and DiClimente, 1985; Humphrey and Friedman, 1986; Clapper, 1992; Yu and Williford, 1994). Patterns of substance use also tend to follow a predictable course among early initiators, from alcohol use to marijuana use to other more dangerous drugs such as cocaine (the socalled "gateway" theory of drug use patterns). Thus, early onset of alcohol consumption is often seen as a precursor to the use of other illegal and more dangerous substances (Yu and Williford, 1992; Blankfield, 1990; Dinwiddie et al., 1992; Kandel et al., 1992).
Given the strong empirical relationship between timing of onset and subsequent use patterns, we focus on predictors of the age of substance use onset. The dependent variables in the analyses of both the Native and OHSSUP data may be interpreted as survival time in years before experiencing either first drinking (defined as one full glass) or drug use.2 Over this interval, indi-

viduals may either survive the event up to the survey time, in which case they are considered censored, or succumb to the event before the date of the survey (uncensored cases).3
Available background predictors pertaining to early family functioning and attachment include: the experience of sexual abuse during childhood; parental depression during childhood; whether the mother or father had a drinking or drug problem; the perceived closeness of the affective relationship with parents while growing up; the experience of early parental loss through separation or death; and the occupational attainment of the parent or guardian while the child was growing up. In particular, reported intimacy in parent-child relations is a direct measure of successful attachment; collectively, these family background attributes may help to determine the likely degree of successful

2 T h edrug use onset measure in the Native sample is based on information about the timing of use onset of the following: cannabis, barbiturates with and without a prescription, heroin, speed, cocaine, stimulants with and without a prescription, tranquillizers with and without a prescription, LSD, hallucinogens, and anabolic steroids. In the OHSSUP data, the following items are included: sedatives, tranquillizers, stimulants, analgesics, non-medicinal inhalants, marijuana or hash, cocaine, LSD, PCP or hallucinogens, and heroin.

3TheNative and Non-native data sets alike measure time in discrete units (i.e., years of age) which may result in a large percentage of ties. Since most survival models are based on the mathematical assumption of continuous time (i.e., time measured in small fractional units such as days, weeks or months), a large number of ties may lead to biased regression coefficients (Blossfeld et al., 1989). Relevant research on the question of substance use timing, however, has revealed little difference in the shapes of the hazard functions estimated via discrete versus continuous time methods (see De Wit et al., 1997).

psychosocial attachment between parents and their children.
The respondent's age and sex are also considered since various studies have observed significant age and sex differences in alcohol-related behaviors (Blankfield, 1990; Cheng and Chen, 1995; York and Welte, 1994). Age at the survey data is included as a covariate in our analysis to assess possible cohort differences in the risk of substance use onset. The analysis of drug use timing examines the specific impact of alcohol consumption onset in addition to the other covariates just noted. In order not to confound cause with effect, the necessary assumption made here is that the initiation of drinking, as discussed above, operates as a "gateway" or precursor to subsequent use of other substances.4
For both samples, covariates selected for the hazard analyses of alcohol and drug use onset are measured as follows: Age at the date of data collection is grouped according to the age categories 19-30, 3 1 ^ 9 , and 50 or older, with the oldest group serving as the comparison or reference group. Parental occupation during the respondent's childhood is grouped according to "professional," "service sector or small business," "farming or other occupations," "blue collar" (the reference category), and "unemployed." In addition, the model of drug use onset examines the influence of timing of alcohol use onset. With this variable, the relevant categories are "never drank," started "before age 13,""between 13 and 16," "between 17 and 18," and "19 or older" (the reference group).
4Since peer risk variables such as tobacco and alcohol use are not available from the Native data set and are only measured as of the survey date in the OHSSUP data, they are not included as possible predictors of substance use timing.

Among the Native sample, quality of
affective relations with mother and father
while growing up are measured separately,
with those not enjoying close relations serving as the reference.5 In the OHSSUP
sample, relationship with parents is also a
dichotomous variable measuring perceived
closeness between parents and child while
the respondent was growing up; those not
enjoying close relations serve as the refer-
ence category. With the OHSSUP measure,
unfortunately, no distinctions can be made
between quality of the child's relationships
with the mother and the father since the
question from this survey referred to par-
ents collectively. This combining of mother
and father is unfortunate since, as Rutter
(1995) points out, most people will have
more than one attachment figure in their
lives and their relationship with each can be
quite different. Moreover, the original sur-
vey question ("Did you have a close rela-
tionship with your parents while growing
up?") was measured according to two pos-
5In the Native sample, the childhood attachment measure is comprised of six items designed to tap the degree of emotional warmth, intimacy, affection, communication, support and understanding that respondents perceived themselves as receiving from their parents as children. Each item consists of five ordinal-level categories ranging from 'never' to 'almost always'. Parental attachment items in the Native questionnaire, measured separately for relations with mothers and fathers, were as follows: Thinking back over your relationship with your mother/mother substitute or father/father substitute, how much of the time did s/he:
1. speak to you with a warm and friendly voice? 2. seem emotionally cold to you? 3. show affection toward you? 4. enjoy talking things over with you? 5. make you feel you weren't wanted? 6. seem to understand your problems or worries? Each of these items is summed and the resulting scale (Cronbach's Alpha reliability coefficients of 0.88 and 0.89 for the mother and father series questions, respectively) is dichotomized according to positive versus negative affective relations with each parent while growing up (i.e., never, almost never or sometimes experiencing positive interactions versus very often or almost always enjoying such relations).

sible outcomes, necessitating the reduction in the number of categories on the Native survey measures. Apart from this one discrepancy, the measures employed in the two data sets are operationalized in a very similar or identical manner.
Mother's and father's substance abuse and depression are dichotomous variables, with those not reporting a history serving as the reference group. Sexual abuse is measured at the nominal level according to whether the respondent was ever abused sexually as a child. Those not experiencing abuse of this nature serve as the reference category.6 Separation status refers to whether the respondent was separated from either of his or her parents prior to age 16. In both samples, those not experiencing a separation serve as the reference group.
6Although it is possible to distinguish the relationship of the perpetrator to the victim in both the Native and non-Native data sets, the primary measure of abuse used in the present analyses does not differentiate. Given very small numbers reporting childhood victimization in the general population sample and especially involving a family perpetrator, combined with the major sex imbalance in reported levels (over 80 per cent of victims are female), further refinements of the abuse measure proved unfeasible. It may nevertheless be argued reasonably that, in any event, the occurrence of sexual abuse reflects certain general conditions and characteristics of the child's home environment, such as low parental competence or lack of proper child supervision (see, for example, Hernandez, 1992; Mian et al., 1994; Lujan et al., 1989).
In the OHSSUP survey, sexual victimization refers to the following events during childhood:
a. whether anyone had ever exposed him/herself to the respondent;
b. whether anyone had ever threatened to have sex with the respondent;
c. whether anyone had ever fondled the respondent's sex parts; and,
d. whether anyone had ever tried to have sex with or had sexually attacked the respondent.
In the Native survey, sexual victimization refers to the following items:
a. whether, as a child, the respondent had ever been sexually approached by a non-family person; and,
b. whether, as a child, the respondent had ever been sexually touched or fondled by a family member.

Sex is measured at the nominal level, with females as the reference category.
The Proportional Hazards model (Cox, 1972) combines multiple regression with life table techniques. This technique is appropriate in overcoming the problems of censoring, which is common in event history analyses and due to the truncation of observations at the survey date. For example, in the analyses of drug use onset, only 10 per cent of respondents in the OHSSUP sample reported substance use by the time of the survey, whereas about 40 per cent in the Native group report prior drug use. Life table techniques can handle this data truncation by combining the experience of those who have undergone the event of interest with those who have not, in the calculation of (corrected) survival probabilities.7 In contrast, with more static techniques such as linear regression which are suitable for determining the structure (i.e., relevant predictors) of an event, hazards modeling is ideal for
7Twoimportant assumptions, however, must be made by event-history models in overcoming the problem of censoring. First, it is assumed that all cases eventually experience the event of interest, whether by the survey date or at some future time. Second, censoring is assumed to occur randomly over the interval such that censored cases are considered to be at risk of initiating use half way through the interval. A probability of experiencing drug or alcohol use is then calculated for each case at various durations. The denominator of these conditional probabilities includes both censored and uncensored cases who are at risk of substance use onset during the interval. The numerator consists of the actual number of cases experiencing onset. Since the Proportional Hazards procedure makes full use of all censored cases, individuals who are censored or lost to analysis by the survey date are assumed to experience the same risk of substance use as others at the mid-interval of survival time. It should be apparent that, with the very large proportions censored in the drug use analysis, particularly with the OHSSUP data, the assumption that all individuals eventually experience the event of interest may be problematic. Nevertheless, given clear-cut evidence from the present study for increased incidence of substance use among younger cohorts relative to older ones, this assumption may be less problematic among younger than older age groups.

studying the process (timing) of an event such as substance use onset.
To identify trends in drinking and drug use onset, we first estimated proportions experiencing the events of interest classified by the given demographic and family background characteristics. The Proportional Hazards modeling technique (Cox, 1972) was then applied to the data in order to determine the impact of family attachment on the rate at which both Natives and Non-natives experience drinking or drug use onset. The application of this procedure yields estimates of the magnitude and direction of effects on timing of a given level of the independent variable as well as the relative risk of undergoing the transition of interest associated with a particular demographic or family characteristic. Different levels of risk, higher or lower, imply differences in timing, either earlier or later, compared to that for an established reference group.
For k time-constant variables, Cox's Proportional Hazards model is as follows:
logh(t) = a (t) + + +
where a(t) can be any function of time. Formally, "for any time t, h{t)/hj(t) = c where i and j refer to distinct individuals and c may depend on explanatory variables but not on time" (Allison, 1984, p. 34).8

RESULTS
Concerning descriptive characteristics associated with alcohol and drug use onset and consumption, Non-natives' use patterns are as follows: median survival times (corrected for censoring) are 17 years for alcohol use and 35 for drug use. Only 7.5 per cent of this group have never used alcohol by the survey date whereas almost 91 per cent are censored with respect to drug use. Given the especially heavy censoring of drug use for the Non-native group, interpretations of "failure" or "survival" times, estimated on the basis of uncensored cases, should be treated with caution.9 Nine per cent of this sample began drinking before the age of 13; almost 40 per cent, between the ages of 13 and 16; 21 per cent, between the ages of 17 and 18. About 24 per cent delayed drinking until at least age 19, the current minimum legal drinking age in Ontario.
For the Native group, comparable corrected median survival times with respect to alcohol consumption are 17 years and to drug use, 32 years. Only about 7.5 percent of this group have never used alcohol by the survey date whereas 60 per cent are censored by the survey with respect to drug use. Eight per cent began

8For further information on the estimation procedure involved, see Allison (1984) and Kalbfleisch and Prentice (1980). In unstandardized form, the coefficients mean that a unit change in the level of the covariate involves a given change (either positive or negative) in the hazard, controlling for other variables in the equation. Exponentiating the coefficients in order to fix the baseline or reference category to one, coefficients less than one work to decelerate the timing of the event or the failure time by a given factor, while coefficients greater than one are interpreted as having an accelerating effect on timing. These antilogged parameter estimates, therefore, yield numerical multipliers of risk per

unit difference in the predictor (Singer and Willett, 1991). With dummy variables, the exponentiated coefficient gives the relative hazard for the groups corresponding to values of the dummy variable, controlling for other predictors.
9The necessary assumption (explained in Note 7) that all individuals eventually experience the event of interest is certainly unrealistic in the case of behaviors such as drug use onset, the result being that survival times are significantly biased upward; nevertheless, these estimates still allow us to make valid comparisons of the relative timing of initiation for Natives and Nonnatives. From this evidence, it is apparent that Natives' onset of drug use is earlier (by 3 years) than that of the general population.

drinking before the age of 13; 36 per cent, between the ages of 13 and 16; 22 per cent, between the ages of 17 and 18; and about 26 percent delayed drinking until at least age 19.10
The uncorrected estimates provide information on patterns of onset for initiators alone and are not, therefore, susceptible to the influence of censoring. Further analyses of the subset of Native and Nonnative initiators of substance use reveal some important similarities and differences between the two cultural groups: First, from among the 92.5 per cent in each group reporting prior alcohol use, 72 per cent of Natives and Non-natives alike report doing so before reaching age 19. By contrast, differences between the two groups appear much more conspicuous with respect to patterns of illicit drug use. Nearly 74 per cent of Natives initiating drug use have done so prior to age 19; this figure compares with about 66 per cent of Non-native initiators. Based on suggestions from previous literature (e.g., Okwumabua and Duryea, 1987), the relative youth of Native Indian drag users may be indicative of faster progression and more severe patterns of use later on in life.
Table 2 presents numbers and percentages of Natives and Non-natives experiencing alcohol and drag use onset, classified by the various demographic and family functioning or attachment characteristics. The most notable features of this preliminary analysis are as follows: Age
10Some caution is due regarding the accuracy of this sample in view of the high rate of nonparticipation among Native males in particular. The generalizability of this sample to other Native communities may also be limited by the diverse geographical and cultural experiences of reserve residents. For further information about the survey and sampling procedures, see Embree (1993).

appears to be associated inversely with substance use onset, and particularly with illicit drag use among Natives where we observe that nearly 75 per cent aged 19 to 30 (compared to 20 per cent of Non-natives of the same ages) have started taking drags. Males also have substantially higher rates of initiation of substance use, with the male-female disparity being particularly noticeable with patterns of illicit drag use. Substantially higher proportions of drag users are found among both sexes in the Native sample: Fifty-seven per cent of Native males and 34 per cent of Native females report drag use onset, as compared to about 13 and 7 per cents for Non-native males and females respectively. In the model of drag use onset, the age at which alcohol use begins appears to be linearly related to use of drags; the impact of this effect seems particularly strong among Native Indians where only 12 per cent of life-time alcohol abstainers report initiation of illicit drag use, compared to 85 per cent of those who started drinking before age 13.
As for family-functioning attributes, parental substance abuse appears to be associated with onset for both Natives and Non-natives, and especially so for illicit substance use. Higher proportions of initiators of substance use are also associated with parental mental depression. Concerning parental occupation, the highest rates of illicit substance use are found among those with professional background status, regardless of cultural status. Differences in proportions initiating alcohol use according to parental occupation appear to be negligible. Early separation from parents appears to be a salient predictor of illicit substance use initiation for both cultural groups. Among both Natives and Non-natives, childhood

sexual victimization also appears to be associated with substance use initiation and illicit substance use in particular. Poor parent-child affective relations as well appear to relate to onset. Among Natives, positive paternal relations seem to correlate with lower rates of illicit substance use onset in that over 55 per cent of those reporting poor relations with their father while growing up have also initiated illicit drug use, in contrast with about 38 percent of respondents reporting satisfactory relations. With Non-natives, a similar pattern of results is evident with the combined parental-relations measure. Twelve per cent of subjects having poor parental relations also report taking drugs, as compared to about 9 per cent of the group enjoying good parental relations.
Table 3 gives the relative risks of drinking and drug use onset, respectively, for both Natives and Non-natives. We observe that a number of factors are significant in affecting the rate at which both Natives and Non-natives experience substance use onset. Looking first at the OHSSUP results on drinking onset, age

cohort exerts the strongest impact on the risk, with those in the youngest age group being at 2.25 times (p < 0.001) the risk of early onset compared to the reference group; in a similar manner, those ages 31 to 49 at the survey date are at 1.39 times (p < 0.001) the risk of those in the reference group.
Father's drug and/or alcohol problem achieves statistical significance at p ^ 0.05 and indicates a 14 per cent increase in risk over those not experiencing this problem while growing up. The impact of mother's substance use problem is more conspicuous, with those reporting a problem being at 61 per cent (p ^ 0.001) greater risk of early onset compared to the reference group. Father's depression (but not mother's) increases the risk significantly as well, by approximately 30 per cent (p < 0.05). Parental occupation proves to be a significant predictor as well. Service sector and small business backgrounds reduce the risk significantly by 19 per cent (p ^ 0.05) compared to blue collar occupations. Unemployment appears to increase the risk substantially (by 28 per cent) but not significantly so,

possibly due to too few cases. Sex also influences the risk, with males being 66 per cent (p ^ 0.001) more likely to begin drinking. None of the other variables in the model appear to exert a significant effect on timing of alcohol use, including sexual abuse, although the obtained coefficient indicates the expected direction of effect (i.e., 11 per cent greater risk for those victimized). Overall, the model is statistically significant at p < 0.001 (x1 = 368.00, df = 14).
Turning to the results on Natives' alcohol use onset, we observe the following. Age cohort has the largest impact on the risk of alcohol use onset, with those in the 19 to 30 age category 2.58 times (p ^ 0.001) more likely to begin drinking than those in the oldest age category. Those in the middle category, ages 31 to 49, have an increased risk of almost 80 per cent (p ^ 0.001) compared to their elder counterparts. The results for Natives and Non-natives alike suggest

strongly that the risk of initiating alcohol use among young people is increasing in a dramatic and linear fashion. Sex is also an important predictor, with males at 46 per cent higher likelihood of initiating drinking than females (p < 0.01).
From among the family characteristics, father's substance use problem is associated with a 39 per cent increase in risk (p ^ 0.01); quality of maternal relations corresponds with a 33 per cent reduction in risk but does not quite achieve statistical significance at the conventional minimum probability level of p < 0.05 (p = 0.07). Parental occupation is also important to the risk, with those from a predominantly farming background at 44 per cent lower risk than those from blue-collar backgrounds (p < 0.001). As for the effects of childhood sexual abuse, it is apparent that victimization has a positive impact on the risk. Those reporting abuse are found to be at 54 per cent greater risk of early onset alcohol use than their

nonabused counterparts (p = 0.01). The overall model is statistically significant at p < 0.001 (JC2 = 136.49, df = 15).
The models of drug use timing shown in Table 3 also reveal some interesting patterns of results. Considering first the general population results, as with the models of drinking onset for both cultural groups, age cohort has by far the largest impact on the risk of drug use onset. In the case of drug use, however, the effect is much more dramatic. For instance, those in the youngest survey-date cohort (ages 19 to 30) are found to be almost 20 times (p £ 0.001) more likely to begin drug use compared to the reference group consisting of those in the oldest group, ages 50 or older; those in the middle age group (ages 31 to 49) are over six times (p ^ 0.001) more likely to initiate drug use than their older counterparts. The measure of alcohol use onset provides evidence that earlier use of alcohol among Non-natives is associated with the use of other drugs. Specifically, individuals who began drinking prior to age 13 are 88 per cent more likely (p s 0.05) to use other substances than are those waiting until after age 19 (the legal drinking age) to begin drinking.
As for family characteristics, father's drug and/or alcohol problem (but not mother's, although the coefficient is positive as expected) is also influential. Specifically, the risk of initiating drug use is increased by 60 per cent (p -- 0.01) among those with a history of paternal substance abuse. Father's depression (but not mother's) during childhood also has a similar but stronger effect on the risk, elevating it by 100 per cent (p < 0.01). The experience of sexual abuse during childhood increases the risk by 72 per cent (p s 0.05). From among the categories of

parental occupation, only the "service sector and small business" group appears to be at significantly different risk of drug use (2.12 times greater) compared to the blue collar category (p < 0.001). Possibly, this result for white-collar-type occupations is explained by the fact that use of many kinds of illicit drugs requires greater financial resources than may be enjoyed by those from blue collar backgrounds (note that the coefficient for the professional group is also positive, although the sample size may be too small to enable detection of a significant effect). Positive parental affective relations reduces the risk by 30 per cent (p < 0.05). Males are found to be at 70 per cent greater risk of drug use onset than females (p < 0.001). Overall, the model achieves statistical significance a t p £ 0.001, with A2 = 297.63, df = 18.
Turning to the Native sample, as was true for both Natives' and Non-natives' alcohol use, we find that age cohort has a large and significant impact on the timing of drug use onset. The youngest group, ages 19 to 30 at the survey date, are 13 times more likely to begin drug use than members of the oldest cohort, ages 50 and older (p < 0.001). The middle age category is also at greater risk, specifically 3.28 times greater, compared to the reference group (p < 0.01). According to the results, the risk of drug use onset for both Natives and Non-natives is clearly increasing over time. Despite apparent risk increases over time for the various age groups of respondents from both cultural groups, the possibility cannot be ruled out that the accuracy in recalling early life events like substance use initiation may also vary somewhat according to age. In addition, changes in availability over time due to either supply or demand factors re-

lated to changing socioeconomic, legal or political circumstances could also be operative. A further possibility is that observed age cohort effects for both cultural groups are explainable, in part, by unmeasured peer influences. Our results appear consistent with Harris' (1995) "group socialization theory" postulating that children's peer groups may be increasingly influential as socializing agents in urban societies. Timing of alcohol use onset exerts a powerful systematic influence on the risk of drug use, with the earliest group of drinkers (i.e., before age 13) at 10.64 times the risk (p < 0.001) of the reference group of late onset drinkers (i.e., ages 19 or older); those in the 13 to 16 age group at six times the risk (p £ 0.001); and those in the 17 to 18 age category at four times the risk (p < 0.001).
Among available family indicators, mother's depression increases the risk by 53 per cent and comes very close to achieving significance at p = 0.07. Mother's drug and/or alcohol abuse increases the risk by 81 per cent (p ^ 0.05). Quality of paternal relations reduces the risk of drug use by 42 per cent (p < 0.01); positive maternal relations reduce the risk by 40 per cent, but not significantly so. Farming and other occupational background lowers the risk by 37 per cent and almost achieves significance at p = 0.07. Unemployment, as well, appears to have the expected positive effect on the risk (55 per cent increase), but is not statistically significant. Males are observed to be at 51 per cent greater risk than females (p ^ 0.05), whereas the experience of sexual abuse during childhood elevates the risk of drug use by 47 per cent (p < 0.05). The model is statistically significant at p ^ 0.001 0 ^ = 286.31, df= 19).

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The above findings need to be interpreted in light of certain methodological limitations. First, since the data are primarily retrospective, they preclude prospective evaluations of causal relationships between childhood family experiences and onset of alcohol or other drug use. Other literature, nevertheless, offers strong support for the use of retrospective reports of early childhood events, downplaying the common criticisms of bias and distortion in recall (Brewin et al., 1993; Lopez, 1996; Anderson and Stevens, 1993; Blatt and Homann, 1992).
A further concern is the possible influence of "uncontrolled heterogeneity." Population heterogeneity refers to the differentiation of a population according to a variety of biological, socioeconomic, or demographic characteristics. Unfortunately, not all of these attributes are readily observable or measurable for the purpose of including all relevant variables in the model. A good example of such effects would be peer associations which cannot be readily measured retrospectively among adult samples. Because such variables cannot be incorporated in any satisfactory way, they are referred to as uncontrolled heterogeneity."
In addition to these general methodological concerns is the issue of comparability of results from the two data sets. It is commonly observed that Natives throughout North America have suffered heavily from social problems such as family violence and child neglect, suicide,
11Although efforts have been made to develop statistical models which attempt to control for this possible "unobserved heterogeneity" (for example, Yamaguchi, 1986), the use of such controls is considered controversial and involves untested mathematical assumptions about the distribution of the unmeasured effects (Vuchinich et al., 1991).

and drug and alcohol abuse (Durst, 1991; Kirmayer, 1994; Morrissette, 1994; Niezen, 1993). The observed smaller prevalence estimates in the OHSSUP sample compared to the Native group for drug use onset in particular (10 per cent versus almost 40 per cent respectively) suggest that comparisons about patterns of drug use should be drawn tentatively. Despite the robustness of the model, extremely heavy censoring means that estimates may be unstable since probabilities will be calculated on the basis of too few cases.
The primary goal of this study has been to test empirically the validity and cultural generalizability of attachment theory in predicting alcohol and illicit substance use onset among Natives and Non-natives in Canada. We find that a number of features of the family environment may entail significant protective and risk effects in the timing of substance use onset. Since the data do not allow for an explicit test of the "nature versus nurture" question, we cannot rule out explanations involving genetic mechanisms of personality development and behavior.
While the impact of the various family attachment and functioning measures appears to depend, in part, on which type of substance and which cultural group is under consideration, the results do point to the salience of the early family environment in affecting the risk and timing of drug and alcohol use onset. Oetting et al. (1989) suggest that drug use among Native American youth relative to Nonnative youth may be more heavily influenced by family associations due to the more isolated living conditions on many Native reserves which have the effect of limiting youths' access to friends. Although the findings do not suggest such differences insofar as family variables ap-

pear to be similarly important in both cultural contexts, the explicit incorporation of peer-attachment measures in future models would certainly improve our understanding of the relative importance of family versus nonfamily associations; such models would also provide a more complete test of the net impact of family contextual factors.
Our results also suggest some important patterns of differences between Native reserve residents and the larger population, namely, that initiation of drinking is a much more important indicator of the onset of use of other substances among Natives than among Non-natives. The timing of substance use progression patterns may indeed be shifting, as suggested by Golub and Johnson (1994),12 such that alcohol use is no longer a necessary precursor to the use of more serious substances. However, Native communities may lag behind the general trends in drug use behaviors exhibited by the larger society in a manner analogous to the long-standing differentials in patterns of morbidity and mortality between the two populations. As Natives' and Nonnatives' patterns of health and illness converge with Natives' achievement of the socalled "epidemiological transition" (Omran, 1971), the influence of early-onset drinking on the timing of drug use initiation
13Golub and Johnson (1994) argue that the timing of the substance use progression pattern might be shifting. Whereas the typical pattern in the past has been from alcohol use to marijuana use to more serious substances, findings from a sample of serious drug abusers indicate that alcohol use is not a prerequisite for marijuana use, but marijuana use almost always preceded the use of serious substances such as cocaine, crack and heroin. This same research maintains that early onset of substance use is a major predictor of later drug usage, but that the importance of alcohol as a precursor to marijuana use may have declined due to the relative increase in the prevalence of marijuana use since the 1960's as well as the increased acceptance of alcohol consumption in present-day society.

may also diminish. Whether this change in turn implies ultimately a change in the overall risk of drug use onset for future cohorts of Native youth remains to be seen. The evidence obtained here indicates that prevention of early alcohol consumption is more important in combating illicit drug use onset for Natives than Non-natives. This information would seem to be particularly important in view of the observed large (absolute and relative) proportions initiating drug use in the present sample of Canadian Natives (almost 40 per cent of Natives compared to only 10 per cent of Non-natives). Parallel findings on Native versus Non-native use patterns in other regions of Canada are reported by Gfellner and Hundleby (1991).
Oetting et al. (1989) have argued that Natives' greater susceptibility to drug use is due not to specific cultural beliefs and practices but to an excess of poverty, prejudice, and lack of economic, educational, and social opportunities. The commonly-held assumption in the literature that Native North Americans' distinctive culture contributes to substance abuse does not appear to be supported by our data given that, apart from differences in prevalence of illicit drug use initiation, the mechanisms do not seem to be remarkably dissimilar for the Natives and Non-natives. This finding would seem especially evident insofar as various dimensions of family attachment examined here are seen to have

comparable influences on the likelihood of substance use onset. Findings from Gfellner and Hundleby (1991) as well support the general conclusion that there appear to be more similarities than differences in the correlations between predictor variables and substance use among Native and Nonnative youth in Canada.
The implications of our findings for attachment theory are that family relations among both Natives and Non-natives are important to children's decisions about whether and when to begin using alcohol or drugs. Thus, intervention programs aimed at preventing early onset use of alcohol or other drugs may be similarly valid for both groups. The information gathered from this study about relevant risk and protective factors is essential to the development of effective health programs and policies, especially in light of strong evidence from this study that for Natives and Non-natives alike the risk of alcohol and particularly drug use onset among younger cohorts has increased dramatically over time, relative to the experiences of previous generations.
