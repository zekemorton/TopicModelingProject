The fertility differences among women are determined by a variety of reasons, not all of which have been identified. Despite extensive studies, differential fertility has yet to be fully, explained. It is imperative that explanations be found if fertility is to be controlled, and control seems to be essential to improve socioeconomic conditions.
In a recent work, Karen 0 . Mason and her associates (1971) reviewed and analyzed more than a hundred studies on differential fertility in the developed and developing countries. In this work, the authors present the major studies undertaken to measure the effect of sodoeconomic variables on family fertility. The major variables included in the studies were: income, occupation, social and geographic mobility, education, family structure, female labor-force partidpation, egalitarian maternal relationship, religion and religiosity, value orientation, and family planning. After a careful examination of the results of these studies, the authors have found very little evidence of uniformity and consistency in the findings of the studies.

However, a general notion that many studies support is that traditional values and beliefs and low socioeconomic status generally encourage high fertility; on the other hand, modern values and opinions and high sodoeconomic status modify the high fertility norms and subsequently lead to the fertility reduction. With this general idea as a basis, survey data have been analyzed to study relationships between various facets of life styles and fertility norms and practices of urban, rural, and tribal populations of a southern province of Iran. The paper spedfically aims to report and discuss the findings concerning the following areas: (1) differential fertility among urban, rural, and tribal groups; (2) correlates of fertility differences within each of the three groups; and (3) relative effects of fertility correlates within each of the three groups.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data used in this report are part of 1,384 interview cases collected from the household heads in a sample survey of social, economic, cultural, and demographic characteristics and attitudes of the urban,

rural, and tribal subpopulations of Fars Province. The survey was conducted in 1968 (Paydarfar, 1974).
The city of Shiraz, the capital of Fars Province, was the urban site. With a population of over three hundred thousand, Shiraz ranks as the sixth largest city in Iran after Tehran, Isfahan, Mashhad, Tabriz, and Adaban. In many respects, Shiraz resembles a medium-sized Western university city and functions as a medical, administrative, and military center for the province and a market place for the nearby tribal and rural population.
The urban information in the study was collected from 1,062 household heads who were residing in 59 randomly selected blocks in the eight social units in Shiraz.
Four villages located in a rural area within the Shiraz district and approximately thirty to sixty miles northwest of Shiraz were chosen as the rural site. These four villages were selected from a group of forty villages located in the rural area after the villages had been ranked according to their degree of modernization. The four represent various degrees of modernity.
The rural information in this report was obtained from 176 household heads in the four villages. Twelve per cent of the household heads were not accessible and 9 per cent of the interview cases were omitted because of incompleteness.
Finally, information related to tribal samples were collected from 146 household heads of Qashghae Tribe of Fars Province. The Qashghae is the major nomadic tribe in Fars Ostan. According to the 1966 census data, this tribe had a population over one hundred thousand.
VARIABLES OF STUDY
Most of the studies on differential fertility undertaken in the developing coun-

tries have explained fertility differences in terms of social stratification variables. In our analysis, in addition to the respondent's socioeconomic status, various aspects of his life style have been hypothesized as affecting his opinion toward family size and his fertility behavior. Related to these variables, response items were selected from the interview schedule for scale and index construction measuring various facets of the life styles and fertility values and behavior of the respondents in the three subpopulations. These items are shown in Table 1. Dependent and independent variables were constructed from these response items.
DEPENDENT VARIABLES
Demographic items (see Table 1) were used to construct two measures of actual fertility performance: (1) the number of children ever born, and (2) the number of children living. Clearly, the two are highly related to each other. In this study, we have used both of them to overcome the effect of recall lapse on the reported number of children ever born.
In addition, five more dependent variables related to fertility norms are included in the analysis. They are (1) the number of children desired by the respondent for himself, (2) number desired for his son, and (3) number desired for his daughter, (4) age at which a boy should marry, and (5) age at which a girl should marry. The purpose of including these variables is to examine whether there is an emergence of new values in relation to age at marriage and ideal number of children and, if so, to identify the factors associated with them. The traditional values associated with these variables (i.e., low age at marriage and large desired number of children) support a high level of fertility. Therefore, even if there is no change in the actual fertility, we may

ism, familism, etc.) are included among the independent variables. Factor analytic technique was used to construct the scales. The items with high validity and reliability and those with low invalidity were selected for scale construction. A scale or index score for each of the variables was computed and assigned to each of the respondents.
Since the data were collected for a large cross-section of people, we have a wide variation in the respondents' age and the duration of marriage. Taking the effect of these two factors into consideration, these variables have been used as control variables in the analysis of fertility performance.

1. Do Iranian urban groups have the smallest and the tribal group have the largest family size?
2. Do Iranian urban groups wish the smallest family size and the tribal group the largest family size for themselves and their children?
3. Do Iranian urban groups prefer their children to marry at an older age compared to the tribal group who wish a younger age at marriage for their children?
The responses to these questions are sum-
marized in Tables 2-4.

The urban respondents desire fewer children and are least likely to feel that "the more children, the better" or that the number of children one had was controlled by the will of God. On the other hand, more than one-fourth of the tribal respondents attribute thenumber of children to God's will. Almost 12 per cent feel the more children, the better

son or daughter to have a family size of one to three children. On the other hand, a large proportion of the rural and tribal respondents leave the control of family size for their children to God's will. The findings in Table 3 clearly indicate that the attitudes and value orientation of tribal and rural populations must substantially be changed toward small family size before a family planning program can proceed successfully among the rural and tribal populations.
Although the age at marriage has been dropping in most Western countries and

rising in the Arab countries (Goode, 1969), marriages still take place at an earlier age in Iran than in many Western nations. Table 4 shows that tribal and rural respondents preferred their children to marry at a much younger age than urban respondents did. Rural respondents desired marriage at even a younger age than did tribal respondents,
Almost half the urban respondents wanted their sons to be at least 24 years of age before marriage, compared with one-fourth of the tribal and 13 per cent of the rural respondents. More than 31

per cent of the urban respondents wanted their daughters to reach 20 before marriage, compared with 10 per cent of the tribal and 3 per cent of the rural. Respondents in all three residential areas preferred their daughters to marry younger than their sons.
The ideal age at marriage reported by the respondents was compared with the actual age at marriage of the married children of the respondents. The results suggest certain discrepancies. The children of the tribal and rural respondents tended to marry later than the age that was considered ideal; 40 per cent of the tribal and IS per cent of the rural married sons reached age 25 before marriage. A similar trend existed for married daughters. Onethird of the tribal daughters were at least age 20 when they married, compared with 13 per cent of the rural. The urban discrepancies between preferred and actual ages of children at time of marriage were the reverse. Children tended to marry earlier than the stated preferred ages. Only 28 per cent of the urban sons were 25 or

older, and only 14 per cent of the daughters were 20 or older when married.
Finally, the indices of fertility among the tribal, rural, and urban groups were compared to find out if they were statistically different. The null hypothesis was that the three groups are the same in regard to various indices of fertility. To test this hypothesis, the mean scores of fertility indices were computed for the three groups, and the differences between mean scores were measured by a Z test. The result of these operations are shown in Table 5. The table shows the ideal family size is highest among the tribal groups, lowest among the urban, with the rural group in-between. In regard to the age of marriage, the urban group has the highest score for both sexes, meaning that the urban respondents prefer their children to get married at an older age than do the tribal and rural parents. In regard to the indices of fertility practice, the tribal families had the largest number of children ever born per household; urban families, the smallest. The high tribal

death rate, however, reduced tribal, rural, and urban differences 'with respect to living children. The birth and death rates in all three groups resulted in almost equal numbers of living children per household. The Z score values in Table 5 indicate that in most cases the three groups are significantly different. Thus, the null hypothesis can be safely rejected.
CORRELATE OP FERTILITY WITHIN TRIBAL, RURAL, AND URBAN GROUPS
The above findings clearly indicate that the tribal, rural, and urban groups are significantly different in regard to most indices of fertility attitude and behavior. The objective of this section is to find out if the selected 23 independent variables significantly explain all or some of the differential fertility within each of the three groups.
This section is divided into two parts. The first part reports the relationship between respondent's general attitude toward fertility and various aspects of his life style; the second part reports the asso-

ciation between respondents' fertility behavior and life style differences.
Fertility Attitudes.--As we indicated before, fertility attitudes are expressed in terms of the respondent's desired family size for himself and his children and also desired age of marriage for his children. In order to measure the association and the statistical significance of the association between indices of fertility and the 23 independent variables, we cross-tabulated them by controlling for age of respondents. The independent variables were categorized into three groups--high, medium, and low scores--for the purpose of cross-tabulation. Similarly, the dependent variables were also grouped. The statistical significance of the association in each case was assessed by testing the value of the chi-square, and the nature of association between dependent and independent variables was determined by Gamma coefficient.
The results of these two statistical values are presented in Table 6. An examination of Table 6 reveals that several

independent variables are significantly associated with the number of children desired by the head of the household among the urban group, especially when the respondents are 35 or more years old. Modern material possessions, communication exposure, fatalism, education of respondent, his wife, and his parents, and his occupation are among the variables which show significant influence on the desired number of children. On the other hand, very few of the 23 variables significantly explain the variation of tribal and rural respondents' desired number of children.
One may argue that the response to the question on desired number of children may be influenced by the past experience of the respondent, in that his response may more closely reflect the number he has than it does the number he desires. The response to the question on the desired number of children for son and daughter should be free from this bias. Only the independent variables explaining the variation of desired family size for urban respondents seem to be significantly responsible for differential attitudes of the urban respondent toward the family size for their children. We can see from Table 6 that only very few of the independent variables have any impact on the desired number of children for son or daughter within the tribal and rural groups.
We examined the relationship between the respondent's opinion on desired marital age for his children and the 23 independent variables (Table 6). Here again, we see significant relationships only within the urban group. Occupation, education, communication exposure, fatalism, familism, and indices of modernization are found to be significantly associated with the age at which the father desires girls and boys to marry.

Finally, it is significant to note that the 23 independent variables in most cases are not significantly associated with the indices of fertility attitudes within tribal and rural groups. In some cases they are related, but the nature of the relationship is inconsistent with the cases among urban respondents. For example, within the tribal group, there is an inverse relationship between the respondent's degree of fatalism and his desired family size for his daughter and also an inverse relationship between the respondent's degree of communication exposure and desired marital age for his son; but the opposite pattern is found among the urban respondents. I t is also surprising that so many rural respondents with a high degree of fatalism desire an older marital age for their daughters.
Fertility Behavior.--Fertility behavior is measured in terms of the respondent's reported number of living children and number of children ever born as related to the couples. Simple correlation technique was applied to examine the association between fertility behavior and various indices of life styles among the three groups. The results are shown in Table 7. Both indices of the fertility behavior are significantly related to most independent; variables among urban respondents. The urban respondents' score on modern appliances, familism, communication exposure, personal health, fatalism, respondent's fortune ladder, educational status of respondent, his wife, and his parent, occupational status of respondent, and duration of marriage seem to be among the major significant variables differentiating both indices of the fertility behavior.
Within the tribal and rural respondents, particularly rural, only very few of the 23 independent variables explain the differential fertility. Furthermore, the effect of

significant variables on tribal and rural fertility behavior seem to be inconsistent when compared to their effect on the urban sample. For example, possession of modern materials, exposure to modern communication media, and educational-occupational status are positively related to the number of living children and children ever born among tribal respondents. But exactly the opposite association is found between related variables among the urban respondents.
Although our tribal sample is not large enough to have our full confidence, these observations challenge the generality and universality of the conventional propositions postulating ah inverse relationship between fertility and socioeconomic status among different population sectors, at least within a country. One explanation may be that in the transitional period

among developing populations, the relationship between fertility and socioeconomic indices is curvilinear. In other words, with the rise of socioeconomic conditions, fertility increases, but as socioeconomic conditions continue rising, fertility declines. To substantiate this observation, we require more detailed historical data on fertility and socioeconomic conditions.
Finally, as Table 7 shows, religiosity and duration of marriage commonly have a positive significant effect on both indices of fertility behavior of tribal and rural respondents. But the religiosity loses its effect to differentiate fertility among urban population.
RELATIVE EFFECTS OF FERTILITY CORRELATES
As we stated briefly above, the available evidence in the field of fertility studies clearly substantiates the fact that the dif-

ferences and change in human fertility norms and behaviors are the function of multiple variables. No doubt the identification and the understanding of these variables and their relative effects on fertility must be the main objective of any fertility study. In our study of fertility correlates, we are limited to the analysis of 23 independent variables. Although these variables express the most significant features of life style, value orientation, and socioeconomic status of the Iranian tribal, rural, and urban groups under study, the selected variables do not explain all the variance of fertility norms and behavior within each of the three groups. Furthermore, the effect of the 23 variables on fertility differences within the three groups are not to be equally weighed. At any rate, the findings in the last section clearly indicated that most of the variables individually have significant relationships with most of the indices of fertility norms and behavior within the three groups.
In this section, the data are analyzed to measure: (1) the joint effect of all the independent variables on fertility behavior; (2) the joint effect of the theoretically interrelated blocks of the variables on the fertility behaviors; and (3) the relative effect of the independent variables on the fertility behavior. Only two of the fertility indices--number of living children and number of children ever bom --were used in the analysis of data in this section. This decision was based on the fact that interval scale could be used only for those two variables, making them appropriate for the kind of statistical analysis used here. Multiple and partial correlation techniques have been used to measure the association between dependent and independent variables.
The results of this analysis are reported in Tables 8-11. Table 8 shows the joint effect of all independent variables on two

indices of fertility. According to the table, the 23 independent variables acting together explain more than 55 per cent of the variation in the number of living children of the tribal and rural respondents. The corresponding percentage for urban groups is roughly 40 per cent. The amount of explanation increases when the number of children ever born is used as an index of fertility within each of the three groups. For example, more than 60 per cent of the fertility variation within tribal and rural groups and more than 48 per cent within the urban groups is explained by the 23 independent variables. This increase might be due to the fact that the first index is also influenced by differential mortality.
A cursory glance at the list of 23 independent variables shows that several of them are theoretically interrelated. Therefore, it would be of great interest to examine the effect of those variables taken together on the dependent variables. For example, educational aspirations for the son and for the daughter are indicators of the same concept, namely, the respondent's view on education. Similarly, the respondent's degree of familism, fatalism, and religiosity are indicative of the traditional value orientation, namely, the respondent's score on traditionalism. The same conceptualization is true in relation to a number of other variables. Thus, meaningful categories were made, and the effect of these blocks of variables were

the educational dimension (achievement of aspirations) consistently explains most of the fertility variation. Within each of the three groups, occupational status and aspirations are next to education. It is interesting to note that while traditional value orientation (fatalism, familism, and religiosity) accounts for relatively significant portions of the fertility variation among tribal and rural population, it ex-

dices of fertility behavior within the three groups. In this effort, multiple partial correlation technique was also used to measure the effect of one set of variables controlling the duration of marriage and nine other blocks of variables. The results of this analysis are in Table 10. It seems that very few of the blocks individually have significant relationships with the indices of fertility behavior.

Within the urban group, only three blocks of the variables show significant association. This is particularly true when the number of children ever born is used as an indicator among the urban respondents. These three blocks are (1) economic satisfaction, (2) educational status of respondent, his wife, and his parents, and (3) communication exposure.
Among the tribal group, almost the same block of variables has a significant relationship with the indices of fertility behavior. But we must bear in mind that the effect of these variables within the tribal group is the opposite of that for the urban group.
Table 10 generally indicates that the respondent's score in each group on two sets of variables (educational background of the respondent, his wife, and parents, and communication exposure) more than the other eight sets of variables individ-

ually differentiate fertility behavior. Thus, these two sets of variables plus duration of marriage seem to be the principle variables, at least among the three independent variables, which determine differential fertility.
Finally, the 23 independent variables were grouped in three relatively distinct categories, and the net effect of the other two categories on fertility indices were measured controlling the effect of the other two categories. The result of this analysis is reported in Table 11. While the sociocultural category significantly explains the variances in the fertility experience within tribal, rural, and urban groups, the economic category by itself seems to have an insignificant effect in differentiating the fertility behavior within each group. As the table indicates, the duration of marriage within each group explains a substantial proportion of the variance. This finding means that regardless of the socio-

ential fertility. Within the sodocultural category the respondent's score on educational background (the respondent's own education and that of his wife and his parents) and communication exposure are the main determinants of differential fertility within the three groups in Fars Ostan.
Finally, while modern value orientation and high socioeconomic mobility reduce the high fertility norms and practices among the urban Shirazi, these factors seem to have a positive effect on the fertility pattern of the tribal population. The direction of the relationship within the rural group in regard to fertility and life style is not quite clear. One plausible hypothesis being established in fertilityrelated studies is that the improvement of socioeconomic conditions among nonurban sectors of developing countries will improve the nutritional conditions of the rural population and this will reduce child mortality and raise the mean number of living children. The evidence in our study not only supports this hypothesis, but also demonstrates that the socioeconomic im-

provement among tribes raises the number of children ever bom. This finding may be surprising, but it is quite possible that at the early stage of modernization, this phenomenon may occur, particularly among rural and tribal respondents with high socioeconomic status who feel having a large family is further strength to their social and economic power. We need further evidence to prove this opinion about the tribal and rural respondents of Iran.
In conclusion, the findings in this study clearly indicate that the sodocultural characteristics of respondents (husbands) affect the fertility behavior of thdr wives regardless of their duration of marriage. Surprisingly, the economic characteristics of the respondents by themselves do not affect the fertility differences within tribal, rural and urban groups in the Fars Province.
