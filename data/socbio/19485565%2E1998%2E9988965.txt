ABSTRACT: Using data from the 1990 National Family and Fertility Survey (NFFS) and employing discrete-time hazards models, we examine the effect of weaning, child death, and socioeconomic factors on postpartum amenorrhoea in Ethiopia. The results show that 91 in every 100 mothers breastfed their child for at least 6 months. The median duration of breastfeeding stands at 18 months, and amenorrhoea lasts for a median duration of 12 months. Significant variations in breastfeeding and amenorrhoea duration are also observed among the different categories of breastfeeding women. The median duration of breastfeeding for lactating women is 24 months, 6 months for those who weaned, and 2 months for those whose child died. The median duration of postpartum amenorrhoea is 14 months for breastfeeding women, 12 months for those who weaned, and 6 months for those whose child died. Discrete-time hazard models reveal that child death has the strongest effect on the resumption of menses. Net of other factors, the risk of returning to menses increased 3 times for mothers whose child died. The effect of child death, however, decreases over time. Weaning also has a significant positive effect; and, like child death, its effect diminishes as time passes. The study further shows significant differences in the risk of returning to postpartum menses by socioeconomic characteristics of the women, even though they are breastfeeding.

Breastfeeding has long been recognized as the major determinant of fertility in noncontraceptive societies. By delaying the return of postpartum menses, lactation produces a suppressive effect on fecundity. Breastfeeding also appears to have an impact on fertility even after menses has been resumed (Santow, 1987; Guz and Hobcraft, 1991). Evidence from the WFS for African and Asian countries shows that breastfeeding, on average, reduces total fertility by at least 30 per cent below natural fertility compared to the reduction by contraception of only 5-20 per cent (Cleland et al., 1984). Given this contraceptive effect of lactation, promotion of breastfeeding practices has often been recommended to be among high pri-

orities in the health-policy agenda of developing countries (Trussell et al., 1992). To this end, an impressive body of research has been conducted during the past fifteen years to assess the impact of breastfeeding on fertility in many of these countries.
Although the generalizations from the existing studies seem to be widely accepted, the evidence for countries in the Horn of Africa has not been successfully demonstrated. This region is subject to high infant and child mortality, frequent drought and food crisis, poor maternal nutrition, and wartime disruption. The region is also characterized by a level of fertility that is near biological maximum and an extremely low level of contracep-

tive use. Understanding the nature of the relationship between breastfeeding and postpartum amenorrhoea in nations of this region is thus essential. The main purpose of this paper is to assess the extent to which variations in timing of weaning and child death have affected the risk of resumption of postpartum menses in Ethiopia, the largest country in the Horn of Africa.
The paper begins with a brief review of the literature on the relationship between breastfeeding, socioeconomic factors, and postpartum amenorrhoea and then examines their applicability in the Ethiopian case.
DETERMINANTS OF POSTPARTUM AMENORRHOEA (PPA) IN OTHER
POPULATIONS
Breastfeeding has been established as the principal determinant of PPA (Knodel, 1977; Srinivasan et al, 1989; Nath et al., 1993, 1994; Jones, 1990). The most important factors that influence this relationship are the frequency and intensity of suckling during day and night. The relationship is also supported by clinical evidence; longer duration, frequent, and intense breastfeeding inhibits ovarian activity and thereby delays postpartum menstruation. However, the frequency and intensity of breastfeeding are affected by the nature and timing of supplementation. Early introduction of supplementary or substitute food for breastmilk decreases the number of suckling episodes, as well as the level of milk production and nursing intensity. These factors in turn result in a quicker return to menses (Srinivasan et al., 1989; Jones, 1990, 1988a, 1988b; Nath et al., 1993; Jones and Palloni, 1990; Santow, 1987; Bracker and Santow, 1982).

Moreover, weaning and child mortality patterns are likely to have significant effects on the underlying process of resumption of menses (Jones and Palloni, 1990). When weaning precedes menses, it is likely to result in shortening the duration of postpartum amenorrhoea. The death of a child who has been breastfeeding also leads to a complete termination of lactation and hence results in early resumption of menses. In short, both weaning and child death, if they occur prior to menses, lead to an immediate cessation of the inhibiting effects breastfeeding on ovulation. It is thus hypothesized that women who terminated breastfeeding because of the death of their children or who weaned their surviving children are likely to resume menses more quickly than those who continued breastfeeding.
In addition to the actual infant feeding patterns, weaning, and child death, the differing demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of individual mothers also influence the timing of return to postpartum menses. The effects of these factors, however, are indirect, and operate through such intermediate variables as breastfeeding and the health and nutritional status of mothers (Srinivasan et al., 1989; Nath et al., 1994; Jones, 1990, 1988a, 1988ft; Nath et al., 1993). Although the causal mechanisms of the association are far from clear, there is a strong relationship between severe nutritional deprivation and longer duration of postpartum amenorrhoea (Jones and Palloni, 1990; Huffman et al., 1987). The stress of poor nutritional status, overall energy imbalance, and associated weight loss on a woman's reproductive system might lead to a longer period of postpartum amenorrhoea.
Maternal education is among the various socioeconomic factors that have

82

significant influence on PPA (Srinivasan et al., 1989; Nath et al., 1993; Jones 1990, 1988a, 1988fc). Education exposes women to and makes them more receptive to messages regarding commercial infant foods, which may cause them to abandon traditional breastfeeding norms. Moreover, educated mothers may have greater interest in the various opportunities for activity such as work outside the home. Such activities may be competitive with both breastfeeding and with childbearing and child-rearing, and hence motivate mothers to feed their babies commercial infant food (Millman, 1985). Furthermore, education may lead to a better standard of living, better health, and nutritional status. Accordingly, educated mothers are likely to have shorter periods of postpartum amenorrhoea than uneducated ones.
Household economic status also exerts a positive effect on the risk of resuming postpartum menses (Nath et al., 1993; Jones and Palloni, 1990). This effect comes from its association with breastfeeding behavior and the nutritional status of women. Wealthier families can easily afford to feed their babies expensive artificial milk, and women from such families are less likely to breastfeed their babies for a longer time in an intense way. Women from poor families, on the other hand, have generally poor nutritional status and produce less breastmilk. These women may also have hungrier babies who suckle more frequently and intensively. Poor women are thus more likely to have longer periods of amenorrhoea than their wealthier counterparts.
Urban residence is another important socioeconomic determinant of postpartum menstruation through its effect on breastfeeding. As is noted by Millman

(1985), in urban areas of many developing societies, bottle feeding is considered to be more modern, sophisticated, and more convenient. Urban environments may also lead to greater access to commercial infant foods and be more supportive or at least permissive of nontraditional behaviors such as bottle and commercial infant food feeding (Millman, 1985). What is more, opportunities for outside activities that compete with both breastfeeding and childbearing and child-rearing generally may be more abundant and more attractive in urban areas. Thus, we expect earlier resumption of postpartum menstruation among urban than rural women.
Finally, parity and maternal age are also key factors affecting both breastfeeding, and the return of postpartum menses (Jones and Palloni, 1990; Millman, 1985). On average, high parity women are older than others. Since fecundity is decreasing with increasing age, older age may lead to a longer period of PPA. Moreover, if there has been an intercohort decline in breastfeeding practices, older women more often prolong breastfeeding and may have a longer period of postpartum amenorrhoea than younger ones. On the other hand, high parity may lead to an earlier weaning, because the cumulative physical impact of repeated childbearing or the inhibiting effect of a houseful of children on breastfeeding (Millman, 1985). Thus, to the extent that resumption of menses is influenced by breastfeeding, high parity women may tend to have shorter amenorrhoea periods than those with a small number of children. In short, mechanisms by which parity and maternal age might affect both breastfeeding and postpartum amenorrhoea in either direction may be proposed.

BACKGROUND ON ETHIOPIA
Breastfeeding is universal and prolonged in Ethiopia. Available evidence indicates that close to 97 of every 100 Ethiopian children born are ever breastfed; and the median duration of breastfeeding is around 19 months (Hasen et al., 1994; CSA, 1993). Breastfeeding is also an important part in the emotional bonding between mother and child. Children are usually fed on demand, and night breastfeeding is common since the baby sleeps with the mother. In traditional Ethiopia, child carrying is compatible with women's work and children are held and carried most of the time during the day. Simply put, close proximity of a child to a mother day and night allows for frequent feeding of breastmilk.
There are, however, variations in breastfeeding status among the various groups and subgroups of women in the country. For instance, breastfeeding is longer among illiterate and rural women, and shorter among educated and urban mothers (CSA, 1993). There are also notable differences in infant feeding habits. It has become a common practice among women from well-to-do families in Ethiopia to supplement or substitute breastmilk by artificial infant foods. Moreover, infants born to such women spend little time in body contact with their mothers so that they do not have easy access to breastmilk. There may also be some inherent incompatibility between breastfeeding and some life styles among mothers with high socioeconomic status that may inhibit the breastfeeding response.
Despite its obvious importance, there has been no study in Ethiopia to date that examined the differential impact of

breastfeeding on the duration of postpartum amenorrhoea and thus on fertility (Hasen et al., 1994). Using retrospective data and employing event history models, the present study assesses the empirical significance of breastfeeding in regulating postpartum infecundability in Ethiopia. It also investigates the impact of socioeconomic factors on the risk of early resumption of postpartum menses. In doing so the basic questions to be answered are: (i) Do weaning and child death affect the timing of resumption of postpartum menses in the Ethiopian setting? (n) Do the effects of weaning and child death on the timing of postpartum menses vary by the mother's socioeconomic characteristics? (Hi) Do the differing socioeconomic characteristics of mothers influence the return to postpartum menstruation independent of breastfeeding and child death, and to what extent?
MATERIALS AND METHODS
DATA
The data we use in this study come from the 1990 National Family and Fertility Survey (NFFS) of Ethiopia, conducted by the Central Statistical Authority (CSA). As of 1997, it was the first and only large scale demographic survey ever conducted in Ethiopia (CSA, 1993). The NFFS used a multistage, stratified sampling plan, with major strata based on regional and rural-urban divisions.1 The NFFS was designed to be nationally representative. However, it could not cover most parts of the northeastern and north-

western highlands (Wello, Gondar, and Tigray regions), and some parts of the lowland areas due to security problems (CSA, 1993). The survey covered about 80 per cent of the geographical areas initially planned to be sampled, which, in fact, represent more than two-thirds of the country's population. The primary target of the survey was women of age 15-49 years. Information on the duration of breastfeeding and postpartum amenorrhoea following the last two births as well as data on demographic and socioeconomic characteristics for eligible women were collected in the survey. A total of 8,757 women were successfully interviewed2 (CSA, 1993).
We therefore restrict our analysis only to ever-married women who have had at least one live birth at the time of the survey. In the NFFS, information on breastfeeding and amenorrhoea was collected for women who have ever given birth to at least one live child. The proportion of births that take place outside some form of marriage is very insignificant in Ethiopia. These restrictions provide 6,256 women for the analysis. Of this number, 5,314 (85 per cent) have had at least two children at the time of the interview, and the remaining 942 (15 per cent) have had only one child. The present analysis is thus based on information for 11,570 children born to ever-married women:3 6,256 for the open, and 5,134 for the last closed birth interval. In other words, each child constitutes the unit of analysis.
2Thisfigureis about 62 per cent of the number initially planned to be interviewed. However, within the areas covered by the NFFS, the response rate was over 96 per cent (CSA, 1993).
3Strictly speaking, the unit of analysis is the individual child.

It should be noted, however, that the data from the Ethiopian NFFS show marked heaping of both breastfeeding and PEA duration on certain preferred digits. The distortions in the reported data are most pronounced at 12, 18, 24, and 36 months. Heaping in breastfeeding duration may be genuine and reflect weaning at socially prescribed points in a child's development. But heaping in PPA duration is likely to be as the result of recall or response errors, since resumption of menses is not under the voluntary control of the women (Trussell et al., 1992; Jones and Palloni, 1990). In fact, such response errors are not unexpected in a country like Ethiopia where the great majority of the women are illiterate, and hence dating of events is inherently difficult.
Admittedly, distortions in the reported duration of amenorrhoea could introduce biases in the estimated effects of covariates. Cognizant of this fact, we include in our multivariate statistical models a' measure to net out heaped responses in PPA duration. This measure assumes a value of unity when the duration of PPA is 6, 12, 18, 24, or 36 months and zero otherwise. To see the relative effect of heaping, we re-estimated all the models without this variable. In the models that do not contain a measure for heaped responses, we find that the magnitudes of the coefficients of all the covariates are attenuated. We have also fitted models only for women whose reported duration of PPA are not multiples of six, and the results are not altered in any significant way (not shown here). Therefore, models with a control for heaped responses may provide conservative estimates of the true values of the explanatory variables included in the analysis.

METHODS
We use the Kaplan and Meier (1958) product limit lifetable method to determine the median duration of PPA for each covariate category. This method takes into account the exact time (in months) during which each woman was at the risk of weaning. It thus allows us to include data for those who have not terminated breastfeeding as well as for those who have not ever breastfed.
To estimate the net effect of weaning, child mortality and each of the other fixed covariates on the resumption of menses while simultaneously controlling for other factors, we employ discrete-time hazards logistic regression models4 (Allison, 1982). The outcome of interest in our model is resumption of menses in the current month. The logit of resumption of postpartum menses in month t is thus given by:
where Trjt is the probability of resuming menses in month t for a woman i with a vector of covariates Vitj, Xjtk, Zitl. Vitj stands for time-varying covariates that correspond to weaning and child mortal-
4To check the robustness of the results of the discretetime hazard model, we also estimated Cox's proportionalhazards model. Following Yamaguchi (1992), comparisons of the fit of non-tested models were made based on the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), given by BIC=G2--(DF) ln(N), where G2 is the likelihood-ratio chi-square, DF is the number of degrees of freedom, and N is the number of observations. The model with the largest value of BIC is the best among those compared. Our calculations revealed that the discrete-time hazards technique provides the best for all the estimated models (not shown here).

ity in month t; the Xitk covariates are fixed individual and household characteristics; the Zitl covariates are controls for duration of PPA; and 30, Pj; 0k, and (3, are vectors of unknown regression coefficients to be estimated.
To apply the discrete-time hazards model, we constructed a person-month data set. For each month after the birth of the last or next-to-last child, we create a dummy variable indicating whether a woman resumes menses. If the woman resumes menses in that month, the dummy variable is coded 1; if the woman does not resume menses, the variable is coded 0. For women who returned to menses, the person-months after the month of resumption of menses are excluded from the data. An observation is censored by the occurrence of the interview. This procedure provides a data set with 168,511 person-months (88,800 in the open, and 79,711 in the last-closed birth interval), three timevarying variables (full breastfeeding, weaning, and child death) and a number of fixed covariates.
In this analysis, breastfeeding status refers to the timing of weaning and child death and has three categories: (i) fall breastfeeding--if a woman was breastfeeding at the time of menses; (ii) weaning--if a woman weaned her surviving child prior to resumption of menses; and (iii) child death5--if a woman terminated breastfeeding because of the death of her child before she resumed menses. The main explanatory variables are thus the timing of weaning and child death (if they occur); full breastfeeding is used as a reference category. Both of these two

timing measures are dummy variables having a value of 1 after the event (weaning or child death) occurs. This specification is needed to properly formulate the effects of weaning and child death on postpartum amenorrhoea.
The other three independent variables are fixed covariates and include maternal education, household economic status, and place of residence. Maternal education is defined as the highest grade completed by the mother at the time of interview6 and has three categories: no schooling, some primary, and some secondary.
Household economic status is a proxy measure for household income and is divided into three classes:7 high, medium, and low. This variable is constructed based on an inventory of household items, using a principal component analysis. After some experimentation on the classification, the upper and lower quartiles of the value were taken to represent the higher and the lower strata, respectively.
Place of residence refers to the place where the mother was living at the time of the birth of the child and is a dichotomous variable, rural and urban. We control for birth order and age of the mother at the birth of the child.8 Birth order is categorized as 1, 2-3, and 4 or higher; and age is grouped into 15-24, 25-34, and 35-49.
6Treatingeducation as a fixed covariate does not affect our results, since it is very unusual for Ethiopian women to continue their studies once they are married.
7Given the socioeconomic conditions that prevailed in Ethiopia in the last couple of decades, our treatment of the household economic status variable as a fixed covariate seems a safe assumption.
8Other factors such as women's employment status, religion, ethnic background, and sex of the child were included in initial models (not shown here). However, none of them was significant at the 0.05 level and hence they are excluded from the analysis.

The duration of PPA is also included in the analysis as a categorical variable. After some experimentation, we selected five categories in completed months (0-5, 6-12, 13-18, and 19+). Here we assume that the risk of returning to menses is constant after 18 months and also in each of the three intervals during the first 18 months, but varies between intervals.
RESULTS
Table 1 presents the means of the variables included in the analysis as well as the median duration of breastfeeding and PPA. The results show that breastfeeding is nearly universal and of long duration in Ethiopia. More than 95 per cent of mothers in our sample ever breastfed their last two children, and close to 91 per cent of the children were breastfed for at least 6 months. The median duration of breastfeeding for the entire sample is 18 months. Consistent with this universal and prolonged pattern of breastfeeding, we find the overall median duration of PPA (12 months) to be longer than those reported for many other developing countries (Nath et al., 1994). The survival curve (Figure 1) shows a monotonic decline in the proportion of women amenorrheic by month postpartum.
As expected, we find significant variations in the duration of breastfeeding and PPA by breastfeeding status. About nine in every ten women in the sample were breastfeeding when their menses began, and breastfeeding lasted for a median duration of two years. A little more than 7 per cent weaned prior to resumption of menses, with a median duration of breastfeeding of six months. Child death terminated breastfeeding prior to menses for about 4 per cent of the women; these women had a median du-

ration of breastfeeding that was only two months (Table 1).
Consistent with the foregoing results, we find a significantly longer period of PPA among breastfeeding women than among those who weaned or who experienced a child death. Whereas PPA lasts for a median duration of over 14 months among breastfeeding women, it lasts only for a median duration of 12 months among those who weaned, and 6

months among those whose child died (Table 1). The survival curves also indicate that, at each month postpartum, a significantly higher proportion of women who weaned, or who had experienced child death, resume menses compared to lactating women (Figure 1).
Moreover, the bivariate results suggest that differences in the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the women influence the risk of resuming

postpartum menses. Women with better education and household economic status and those who live in urban areas are likely to return to menses much earlier than other women. Older and higher parity women also have longer periods of amenorrhoea (Table 1). These results are consistent with the fact that actual breastfeeding patterns are not homogeneous across the study women. The differentials are, however, unadjusted for possible confounding effects. Discrete-time hazards regression models make it possible to separate the net effect of each of the covariates by simultaneously controlling for other confounding factors.
The results of the discrete-time hazards models for predicting the likelihood of resumption of menses for each interval are reported in Table 2, while results for the pooled sample are presented in Table 3. A visual comparison of the parameter estimates and levels of significance for the covariate effects reveals very similar

results across the closed and open intervals (Table 2). A more formal test of the similarity of the effects of the covariates in the two intervals is given by estimating a pooled model with a variable indicating open or closed interval and interactions of interval with the covariates. If one assumes that in different intervals the relative effects of the covariates are constant, the net effect of these variables on the risk of resumption of menses should be the same in each interval (i.e., no significant interaction effect). Indeed, we find none of these interaction terms to be significant at the 0.05 level. Therefore, we base our discussion on the results from the pooled sample models, controlling for whether the event is for an open or closed birth interval (Table 3).
Model 1 in Table 3 is estimated without the breastfeeding variables to examine the overall effects of some selected socioeconomic factors on the resumption of menses. Household economic status

has the strongest effect; women from relatively wealthier households are more likely to return to menses than those from poor households. Net of other factors, women from higher and medium economic classes have, respectively, about 1.9 (e0632) and 1.3 (e0247) times higher risk of returning to menses than their

counterparts from the lower class. The difference in the risk of returning to menses between women from a high economic class and for those from a medium economic is also significant (Table 3, Model 1).

the early resumption of postpartum menses, and its effect increases as the level of schooling increases (Table 3, Model 1). Net of other individual and household factors, women with postprimary education have at least a 73 per cent higher risk of returning to menses than those with no formal schooling. Even some primary education significantly increases the probability of returning to postpartum menses by about 23 per cent.
Consistent with our expectation, urban residence significantly increases the risk of early resumption of postpartum menses. Controlling for other factors, urban women are about 1.3 times as likely as their rural counterparts to resume postpartum menstruation.
Regarding birth order of the child, we find the association to be significant and in the expected direction (Table 3, Model 1). That is, the risk of resumption of menses decreases as parity of mothers increases. But the magnitude of the parameter estimate is more substantial for the first-born children. Age is not significantly associated with the risk of resumption of postpartum menses. This finding is not surprising given the uniformity of breastfeeding duration among the three different cohorts of women (Table 1).
Note that the dummy variables for time intervals have significant associations with the risk of resuming menses, showing an increasing trend with time. This trend may be related to a natural pattern toward reduction in the levels of hormone inhibitors following a birth.
In sum, our analysis reveals that the three socioeconomic factors--household status, education, and urban residence-- accelerate the early resumption of menses in Ethiopia. These results are consistent

with findings from other studies in developing countries (Jones and Palloni, 1990; Nath et al., 1993). The significant positive influence of household wealth might have resulted from its relationship with breastfeeding or other intermediate factors such as the nutritional and health status of the women. Availability of resources in households provides alternative food to breastmilk. Women from such households may thus decide not to breastfeed, and in turn may have shorter periods of postpartum infecundity. Moreover, in many developing countries such as Ethiopia, weight loss over the postpartum period or poor nutritional status is characteristic of mothers of lower economic class. Thus, women living in impoverished households are likely to experience longer periods of postpartum amenorrhoea than those from wealthier families.
The significant positive relationship between education and amenorrhoea may be due to the effect of increasing education on the decline of breastfeeding. Educated mothers are also likely to have a better standard of living and in turn have better health and nutritional status. Consequently, their menses may return more quickly than would otherwise have been the case.
The positive effect of urban residence on postpartum menses may also be attributed to declines in breastfeeding practices among urban women. It has been argued that, due to behavioral changes associated with urbanization, breastfeeding practices continue to decline in developing countries (Millman, 1985), with a trend toward earlier weaning and mixed feeding. This trend is also likely to be true in the case of urban Ethiopia, leading urban mothers to resume menses much earlier than their rural counterparts.

Finally, the strong positive association between first birth and early resumption of menses may be due, among other things, to factors related to infant feeding patterns. The tendency to give supplemental food early for first-born children is high. Besides, breastfeeding is a learned behavior and requires the coordination of several reflexes in the body of the mother. Initiating breastfeeding for the first time may thus be more difficult than subsequent breastfeeding. All these factors may lead to a quicker return to menses.
Does breastfeeding mediate the effects of the socioeconomic factors on the risk of resuming menses? Comparison of the results of Model 2 with those of Model 1 (Table 3) indicate that the inclusion of the timing of weaning and child death significantly improves the fit of the model. However, a closer look at the parameter estimates of Model 2 reveals similar patterns of relationships between the individual and household factors and the risk of resumption of menses to those reported earlier. Simply put, we observe marginal changes in the magnitudes of the effects of the socioeconomic variables when the influences of weaning and child death are taken into account.
Turning to the net effects of weaning and child death, we find that the relationships between these two events and timing of resumption of menses are highly significant and in the expected direction. Net of socioeconomic and demographic factors, women who weaned or those who experience a child death by any month are significantly more likely to return to menses than those who were breastfeeding in that month. The effect of child death is, however, substantially higher than that of weaning. For instance,

net of other factors, mothers who experienced a child death by a given month are at least three times as likely as breastfeeding women to return to menses. The corresponding figure for women who weaned their surviving child is 1.7 (Model 2, Table 2). The results of Model 3 (Table 3) also reveal significant interactions of child death and weaning with duration dummies. The influence of both weaning and child death on resumption of postpartum menses tends to decrease as time passes. This downward trend probably is due to the changing composition of women who wean or whose child dies as months postpartum increase. Women who wean or who experience a child death, and who resume menses shortly thereafter, are likely to be more fecund than those who remain amenorrheic, even after they terminate breastfeeding.
Do the effects of weaning and child death on the timing of postpartum menses vary by socioeconomic characteristics of the women? To address this question, we have estimated a model that includes all the variables used in Model 3 (Table 3) and measures of interactions of weaning and child death with the socioeconomic variables. However, the results reveal that none of these interaction terms is significant at the 0.05 level (not shown here). It may thus be said that, despite differences in socioeconomic characteristics, the effects of weaning and child death on the resumption of postpartum menses remain the same across all groups of the women. This result provides strong evidence of the important role of breastfeeding in regulating postpartum amenorrhoea in Ethiopia.
Consistent with similar studies in other developing nations, the foregoing analysis

identifies breastfeeding as the principal determinant of postpartum amenorrhoea in Ethiopia. The analysis also shows that the socioeconomic variables have a significant influence on the risk of resumption of menses, even after the effects of weaning and child death are taken into account. The persistence of these significant breastfeeding-adjusted differentials by the socioeconomic factors is, however, contrary to our expectation. We expected convergence in the differentials once we controlled for breastfeeding status. This unexpected result may be due to unmeasured characteristics of mothers. For instance, it is possible that differences in biological fecundity of the women may be generating a spurious association between the socioeconomic variables and the risk of resuming postpartum menses. While more fecund women resume menses quickly, less fecund women may remain amenorrheic for a longer period, regardless of breastfeeding practices. The other possible confounding factor may be women's nutritional and/or health status. None of the variables in the analysis is a good indicator of these dimensions of life among Ethiopians.
Although the retrospective nature of the data limits the extent to which we can deal with problems of unobserved factors, we attempted at least to control for women's fecundity using some proxy measure. We estimated a model for the open birth interval, controlling for the duration of PPA in the closed birth interval as a proxy measure for women's fecundity (Table 3, Model 4). This control is not an especially strong test for the possible spuriousness of the relationships, but provides at least a crude test of that hypothesis.
The results of Model 4 (Table 3) indicate that a shorter amenorrheic period in

the last closed birth interval predicts a significantly higher risk of early resumption of menses in the open birth interval. Net of breastfeeding status and other factors, every additional month of PPA duration in the closed interval reduces the risk of resuming menses in the open interval by at least 4 per cent. If a woman had an 18month PPA period in the last closed birth interval, her monthly risk of returning to menses following the birth of her most recent child is at least 40 per cent lower than that of a woman with a duration of only 6 months. The strong negative association between next-to-last and last postpartum amenorrhoea periods may thus suggest that this control variable is a good proxy for women's fecundity.
Regarding the effects of the socioeconomic variables, we still have little success; we find marginal changes in the parameter estimates of the socioeconomic factors. In other words, the estimates of the effects of the socioeconomic variables from this model do not appear to be explained by underlying differences in fecundity, nor are they mediated by breastfeeding status. On the other hand, the introduction of a proxy measure for women's fecundity significantly increases the magnitudes of the effects of weaning and child death on postpartum menses. These increases are strong evidence of the important role played by breastfeeding in regulating the underlying process of postpartum amenorrhoea in Ethiopia.
CONCLUSIONS
This study provides supporting evidence for the already established relationship between breastfeeding and resumption of postpartum menses. Both the lifetable and discrete-time hazards analyses reveal

that in Ethiopia, as in any developing society, breastfeeding regulates the underlying process of resumption of menses. Results from discrete-time hazards models, in particular, indicate that weaning and child death significantly increase the risk of early resumption of menses, even after controlling for socioeconomic and demographic factors. The influence of child death is more substantial than that of weaning, but the effects of both of these events appear to decline over time. The results further show the existence of distinct subgroups of women with significantly different hazards of returning to menses, even though they are breastfeeding. Net of breastfeeding status and women's fecundity, higher economic status and education and urban residence significantly increase the early resumption of menses.
The study however provided no evidence about the likely effects of supplementation or frequency and intensity of suckling. It is likely that women with better education, and economic status may tend to introduce food supplementation because they can afford it. The tendency among low parity and urban women to use supplementary infant food is also high. These women may have shorter average duration and fewer day and nighttime suckling inputs than other groups, and as a result, they may have a shorter PPA period. Maternal nutritional and health status may also play a role in regulating the return to postpartum menses. Women with poor nutritional and/or health status are likely to produce less breastmilk. These women may also have hungrier babies who suckle more frequently and intensively, reducing their risk of early resumption menses. Thus, to make concrete generalizations regarding

the relationships among breastfeeding, socioeconomic factors, and PPA in Ethiopia, our findings require confirmation by research more focused on this issue. Such research should include information on frequency, intensity, and supplementation of breastfeeding as well as on women's nutritional and health status.
Nonetheless, the results of the study have some important policy implications for the fertility rates of the country. The evidence that some groups of the study women have shorter durations of breastfeeding than others signals that breastfeeding practices may have declined among some groups of women over time. If these changes in breastfeeding practices were to continue, they would be likely to be diffused throughout the society over the years to come. The diffusion of abandonment of breastfeeding practices, without being accompanied by adoption of modern contraception, would certainly result in shortening the length of the postpartum infecundible period, which could lead to a rise in fertility levels. Therefore, recognizing the suppressive effect of lactation on fecundity, and more importantly the clear health advantages of breastmilk for infants and young children, Ethiopian health officials should place breastfeeding promotion as a priority in their health-policy agenda. There is a need for improving the quality and availability of modern contraceptive methods since breastfeeding clearly does not produce long enough periods of postpartum amenorrhoea to reduce large family sizes. Efforts should also be made to improve the health status of children and their mothers so as to avert the problems caused by high child mortality and replacement fertility.
