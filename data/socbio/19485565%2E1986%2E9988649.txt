ABSTRACT) Two surveys designed to appraise fecundity and mortality were carried out In Morocco in 1983 and 1984, on samples of 3,000 and 5,000 women, respectively, In the city and in the province of Marrakech. Infant mortality was studied using the biometric method of J. Bourgeois-Pichat. The first results presented in this article highlight the absence of excess exogenous mortality among women under thirty years of age living in a provincial urban environment and among women from the city of Marrakech whose husbands are employed in service activities. These results are discussed in relation to the socioeconomic backgrounds of the sample families.

For sorhe years research conducted by demographers in industrialized countries has confirmed the already widespread opinion that infant mortality can no longer be considered as an indicator of economic and social development (Hohrt, 1981). A recent study (Lantoine and Pressat, 1984) even shows a development of the internal structure of infant mortality, which is expressed in the spread of endogenous deaths during the first year of life and even later. Moreover, these results challenge the biometricmethod set up by J. Bourgeois-Pichat to separate endogenous from exogenous deaths.
However, in developing countries and in spite of the variety of demographic transition processes, infant mortality rates still remain at a high level. Bourgeois-Pichat's law can only be applied imperfectly, and one can note the appearance of excess exogenous mortal-

ity starting between the third and the ninth month depending on the countries or regions.
In this study, based on research carried out in Morocco over several years, we set out to provide some elements for reflection on the recent developments in this phenomenon.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The results presented are from two retrospective surveys conducted in 1982^ and 1984. The aim of both was to supply quantitative information on fecundity and mortality in relation to various forms of cultural behavior and to economic and social conditions. Three thousand women replied to a questionnaire in the twenty health centers of the Cityof Marrakech in 1983.The following year, a similar questionnaire was presented to five thousand women from the

province of Marrakech, excluding the city.
In order to appraise the structure of infant mortality and because of a lack of precise statistics concerning the causes of death, we used J. Bourgeois-Pichat's biometric method, which enables one to separate endogenous deaths (due to causes prior to birth or resulting from the birth itself) from exogenous deaths (caused by factors depending on the child's social environment). This method consists in grouping the deaths from zero to twelve months according to a logarithmic scale of age with the form Log3 (n + 1), n being the age in days. When the graphic adjustment of the grouped deaths is appropriate, a straight line is obtained. Its intersection with the axis of the ordinates give us the value of the endogenous deaths. The exogenous deaths are obtained by subtraction from the total.
RESULTS
For the two surveys as a whole, the results of the distribution and structure of infant mortality agreed quite closely with those found in African countries where similar studies have been made (Bchir, 1967; Cantrelle, 1969; Abdou, 1972; Tabutin, 1976). In the city of Marrakech and in the urban sectors of the province, the most striking aspect is the presence of excess exogenous mortality (or exceptional exogenous mortality) from the fourth month onward, a phenomenon which is more pronounced among female children. In rural areas, excess mortality is still to be found but appears later, around the eighth or ninth month.
However, two elements appear to reveal a new trend in the structure of infant mortality. Indeed, in the city of

Marrakech, a differential analysis according to the socioprofessional category of the head of the family highlights an absence of excess exogenous mortality when that person is employed in the tertiary sector.1 In urban areas of the province, we notice the same phenomenon in the case of women under thirty years of age. The divergences observed do not appear to be ascribable to the nature of the study, even though errors or omissions may be frequent in retrospective surveys. Indeed, they were kept to a minimum by employing medical staff trained for the needs of such a survey. Moreover, a study on Senegal (Lecomte-Enselme, 1984) shows that in the field of fecundity there is excellent agreement between data collected in retrospective surveys and that of repeated demographic surveys.
These results are worthy of some development. For the city of Marrakech (cf. Table 1), we notice that women from the tertiary sector are the youngest, those who married the latest, and whose husbands are the least often polygamous. They are more likely to give birth in hospitals and breastfeed for a shorter length of time. They belong to the households with the largest number of incomes, though the number of persons per household is relatively low and their homes are the most likely to be equipped with lighting and running water. Inversely, the categories "manual workers" and "miscellaneous" which seem to have the least favorable living conditions and the most traditional behavior are also those in which the per-

centages of both normal and exceptional exogenous mortality are the highest. In the province (cf. Table 2) we note that excess exogenousmortality startseither at four to five months or around the ninth month. In the latter case, the per-

centage of excess mortality appears to decrease, which can only be explained by an extensionof the phenomenon into the second year of life. Later excess mortality only concernsolder womenin rural areas, whereas early excess mor-
