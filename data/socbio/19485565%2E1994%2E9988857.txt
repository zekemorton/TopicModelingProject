ABSTRACT: Much lower levels of fertility in urban than rural areas throughout sub-Saharan Africa imply that fertility decline in the region may be facilitated by rapid urbanization and rural-to-urban migration. The present study uses data from Demographic and Health Surveys in six countries--Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Senegal, Togo and Uganda--to assess the impact of long-term rural-urban female migration on fertility. Results of logit analyses indicate that in most countries women who leave the countryside represent the higher fertility segment of the rural population in the years before migration. Migrants' risk of conception declines dramatically in all countries around the time of migration and remains lower in the long run among most migrant groups than among rural and urban nonmigrants. Descriptive analyses suggest that the decline in migrant fertility is related to the rapid and pronounced improvement in standard of living experienced by migrants after settling in the urban area and may be due in part to temporary spousal separation.

Persistent high fertility in subSaharan Africa overshadows the fact that fertility is considerably lower in urban than rural areas, and in metropolitan than other urban areas, in most countries in the region. The World Fertility Survey (WFS) in the early 1980's documented an urban-rural fertility differential of about one child (Cochrane and Farid, 1989), while evidence from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted between 1986 and 1991 suggests a differential of about 1.6 children. In some countries, such as Kenya, Togo, and Zimbabwe, the urban-rural fertility differential exceeds two births, while evidence from Ghana, Nigeria, and Senegal, where both WFS and DHS surveys were conducted, indicates that the differential may be growing, as fertility declines faster in urban than rural areas. In sum, these differences imply that fertility decline in Africa may be facilitated by rapid urbanization and rural

to urban migration, as an increasing proportion of national populations are subject to environments where there are lower family-size norms, family planning services, secondary school education, superior child health care services, and higher costs of raising children.
To date, little is known about the ways in which long-term rural to urban migration might contribute to fertility decline in Africa, due in part to demographic data limitations. Surveys in the region have not collected information on both births and migration, while census data generally remain inaccessible to researchers. The study of migrant fertility has now become more feasible, however, with the completion of Demographic and Health Surveys in 20 sub-Saharan African countries. Unlike previous international surveys projects, the DHS provide comparable data on residence and mobility that can be linked to information contained

in retrospective birth histories, and thereby allow for the first time the cross-national study of migration-fertility interrelationships.
Our limited knowledge of the demographic consequences of migration to African cities is also a result of historical patterns of migration in the region. Most migrant women have been seasonal circulators who migrate between rural areas. Large-scale migration of women to cities is a recent phenomenon in most countries. Migrationfertility linkages have become more important for African demographic research, however, in light of the increasing volume and permanence of female rural-to-urban migration in the region in recent years (Peil, 1985). These linkages also have critical implications for government policies and programs relating to migration and family planning. Identification of a prolonged decline in migrant fertility following migration, for example, would suggest that many migrants may have moved to the city in part to realize their familybuilding preferences, and may serve as "innovators" who can impart ideas concerning lower family size to other urban subgroups, as well as to the rural population upon visiting or resettling in the town or village. For governments seeking to lower national population growth, such a finding would support the removal of policy barriers to cityward migration. On the other hand, evidence of continued high or increased fertility after several years of urban residence would identify migrants as an appropriate target group for urban family planning programs, and would provide justification for some of the anti-accomodationist measures of municipal and national author-

ities throughout the region who aim to reduce current high rates of urban growth.
The present study uses DHS data from six countries--Ghana, Kenya, Mali, Senegal, Togo, and Uganda--to assess the impact of long-term rural to urban migration on fertility. The central research question is whether individual women modify their reproductive behavior as a result of moving from high to lower fertility settings, and if so, at what stage and through what mechanisms this occurs. A crossnational focus is chosen to address this issue, to examine whether observed migration-fertility relationships are generalizable to the West and East Africa regions as a whole.
CONCEPTS AND HYPOTHESES
To date, studies of the interrelationships between migration and fertility have been mainly guided by four theoretical perspectives: selectivity, disruption, adaptation and socialization. These differ from each other in (1) relating migrant-nonmigrant fertility differentials to the timing of migration and (2) their emphasis on the impact of type of residence and the act of migration itself on fertility.
The selectivity hypothesis argues that migrant-nonmigrant fertility differentials exist before migration. It is well established that migrants are selected at origin in terms of sociodemographic characteristics, many of which are believed to affect fertility directly or indirectly. Rural-urban migrant women in Africa in the 1980's, for example, were more likely to be unmarried, educated, and to have experienced low child mortality than women who remained in rural areas (Brocker-

grant. Whatever the personal characteristics that distinguish migrants from nonmigrants, the selectivity hypothesis posits that it is these differentials, rather than the migration process or residential setting, that explain fertility differentials (Bacal, 1988).

A third perspective, the adaptation hypothesis (Goldstein and Goldstein, 1983), places emphasis on the effect of destination setting on migrants' fertility. It assumes that migrants will undergo changes in fertility attitudes and behavior after migration as they grad-

their lower fertility than rural nonmigrants results mainly from migrants' adjustment to urban constraints (e.g., higher costs of living and childraising, more crowded housing) and their adoption of urban (lower) fertility norms through exposure to modern media (Farber and Lee, 1984; Goldstein, 1978; Lee and Farber, 1984) or as a function of changing tastes (Campbell, 1989; Findley, 1982). In the African context, increased contraceptive use and induced abortion may both contribute to reduce the fertility of rural-urban migrants, given the greater availability of family planning services and possibly fewer constraints to illegal abortion in urban than rural areas (Coeytaux, 1988). Insofar as urban areas are characterized by much lower fertility than rural areas in most developing countries, including throughout Africa, the adaptation hypothesis takes on the policy implication that ruralurban migration may be an important mechanism to reduce national fertility and population growth.
Finally, the socialization hypothesis argues that changes in fertility norms and behavior take place over a long time period, often from generation to generation. While also recognizing the importance of setting, it posits that migrants' fertility preferences are determined by their childhood environment (Hervitz, 1985). Hence, rural-urban migrants are expected to have similar fertility levels after migration as nonmigrants at the rural origin despite the presence of sufficient motivating factors to lower fertility in the urban area, because of the inherited barriers of childhood socialization (Perez, 1991). Convergence of migrants' fertility to-

wards that of urban natives is expected to occur only after a generation (Campbell, 1989; Lee et al., 1983). Due to data limitations, most studies, including ours, are unable to directly test the socialization hypothesis and can only infer it from the absence of an adaptation effect.
The four hypotheses, if supported by empirical evidence, can lead to different conclusions concerning (1) the fertility impact of migration and (2) the timing of such impact (immediate or long-term). Results of numerous research efforts to date vary considerably from study to study (Perez, 1991). Inconsistent findings may suggest that the interrelations between migration and fertility differ depending on the cultural and socioeconomic contexts under investigation. We argue, however, that a more problematic issue relates to measurement and research design.
While some studies have used longitudinal data to assess the childbearing risks of individual women in relation to the timing of migration (Goldstein and Goldstein, 1982; Lee and Farber, 1984), most studies on migrant fertility have used cumulative fertility measures such as "children ever born." With these measures it is difficult, if not impossible, to separate later effects (adaptation) from earlier ones (selectivity or disruption). For example, lower cumulative fertility of migrants at destination than nonmigrants at origin could be the result of selectivity, disruption, adaptation, or a combination of the three. The question therefore remains as to what extent migrants' fertility is subject to more than one of the expected effects, and if so, which effect is most important.

A second problem is that most research based on single-round survey data measures interruption and adaptation effects by the observed fertility difference between two migrant groups: recent and long-term migrants, or actual and expectant migrants. Lower or higher fertility of long-term migrants than their recent counterparts is interpreted as an adaptation or disruption effect of migration. Here, the static comparison between migrants who moved in different time periods (or at different stages of the individual life course) is interpreted as the dynamic change that is expected to occur to individual migrants after migration. This is premised on the assumption that recent and long-term migrants have similar fertility before migration, are subject to similar personal changes around the time of the move, and follow similar patterns of adaptation after migration. To the extent that most developing countries have been experiencing dramatic changes in fertility and migration patterns, as well as other socioeconomic changes, the validity of such an assumption is highly questionable.
In light of the above shortcomings observed in the literature, our multivariate analysis represents a significant departure from most previous research in the following respects: (1) we focus on the risk of fertility rather than migrants' cumulative fertility, (2) we follow the same female migrants over the pre-migration, migration and postmigration periods, to provide a more accurate account of migration-fertility relations and a more robust test of the various hypotheses, and (3) we focus on a number of countries in the region,

instead of one setting, to arrive at more generalizable results.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
DATA
The six DHS analyzed here, conducted between 1986 and 1990, interviewed women ages 15 to 49 regardless of marital status. Each survey used a nationally representative sample except in Uganda, where nine northern districts representing about 20 per cent of the national population were excluded. Sample sizes range from 3,200 in Mali to 7,150 in Kenya, while the number of women who migrated to urban areas, our focal group, ranges from 759 in Mali to 1,197 in Kenya. Each survey defined "urban area" according to the definition used in the most recent census, with minimum population sizes ranging from 1,000 to 10,000. Migrants are defined in the DHS on the basis of the question "How long have you lived in this locality?" Nonmigrants, or natives, are those women who respond "Always," while responses of migrants are coded by number of complete years lived in the current area. We have calculated the time of migration to the current locality as the survey month minus the number of complete years lived at the locality, e.g., women responding "three" settled in the urban area 36 months before the survey month. It should be noted that the period of residence in the current locality may include departures of less than six months to other localities, where some children may have been conceived.
The quality of the migration data may suffer most from problems of

representativeness. Migrants living in the city at the time of the survey may not be representative of all persons who in-migrated over a given time period, if there has been selective onward or return migration. One way to assess this is through a comparison of characteristics of current urban migrants and rural residents who have returned from urban areas (urban-rural migrants). In the six countries studied here, socioeconomic differences between these groups (not shown) are sufficiently small in size, and the number of permanent returnees to rural areas so few, as to discount the importance of selective return migration as a threat to the following analyses.
The limitations of fertility data collected in retrospective birth histories are well known (Hill and David, 1988) and will not be repeated here. While DHS data quality is thought to be inferior to WFS data collected in some African countries, such as Senegal (Barbieri, 1990), in general, DHS fertility and mortality data from Africa and elsewhere compare favorably with information gathered by the WFS (Institute for Resource Development, 1990).
DESCRIPTIVE ANALYSES
The total fertility rates of ruralurban migrant and nonmigrant groups presented in Table 1 provide some insight into whether migrants to African towns and cities are selected for higher or lower fertility than rural stayers, whether childbearing patterns are disrupted by migration, and whether migrants eventually experience the lower fertility levels of urban natives. Rates are calculated for three-year periods to enhance the reliability of estimates

based on small numbers of women in some age groups. A rough indicator of migrant selectivity is the fertility rate three to six years before the survey of women who subsequently migrated to urban areas in the three years preceding the survey, as compared to the rate of rural nonmigrants during that period. The hypothesis that migration disrupts fertility can be assessed by comparing the rate of this most recent migrant group during the three years preceding the survey (during which time they migrated) to their rate in the earlier period. Evidence of fertility disruption would be a decrease (or increase) in migrant fertility between the periods that differs significantly from the change in fertility experienced by nonmigrants. The fertility rate of women who migrated three to six years ago during that period may also reflect temporary changes in childbearing patterns as a result of migration, to the extent that the rate increases in the subsequent three-year period, or differs greatly from those of women living in rural areas (rural natives and less-thanthree years migrants) in this earlier period. Adaptation to lower fertility in urban areas would be reflected most obviously by a decrease in the fertility rate of women who in-migrated six to ten years ago from the earlier to later periods, to levels that approximate those of lifetime urban residents.
Table 1 indicates that women who migrated from rural to urban areas in the three years preceding the survey in each country had lower fertility than rural natives in the years immediately preceding migration. These migrants' total fertility rate in the period three to six years before the survey ranged from 0.26 lower than rural stayers in Uganda

to 3.64 lower in Kenya. Multivariate analyses later in this study will examine whether this migrant selectivity for lower fertility just before migration refleets a postponement of childbearing

until after the move, or a continuation of lower fertility than nonmigrants throughout the childbearing ages before migration. The rates also suggest that migration from rural to urban

areas disrupts fertility in some African countries, but does not always lead to a temporary decline in fertility. In Ghana and Mali, the most recent migrant group experienced a larger decline in fertility between the premigration and migration periods than did nonmigrants between these threeyear periods, and women who migrated three to six years ago experienced much lower fertility during that period than women in rural areas. On the other hand, in Kenya and Togo, recent migrants experienced an increase in fertility during the period in which they migrated while the fertility of rural and urban nonmigrants declined. These differences between countries might be explained by variation in the extent to which migration involves spousal separation or results in termination of lactational amenorrhea (e.g., if the breastfeeding child does not accompany the migrant mother).
Except in Uganda, where the fertility rate of long-term migrants remained at 5.9 over time, there is a clear pattern of fertility decline among migrants after several years residence in urban areas, which in most countries exceeds the decline experienced by urban natives. In Ghana, for instance, six- to ten-year migrants experienced a decline in fertility from 5.61 to 5.35 between the three-year periods while urban natives experienced an increase from 5.21 to 5.34. In each country except Togo, fertility rates of long-term migrants were closer to those of urban natives after living in the town or city for several years than earlier, and in Ghana and Kenya these migrants achieved virtually identical fertility levels as urban natives. In sum, there is evidence in support of each of the three

main hypothesized migration-fertility relationships in most of these African countries. It is also worth noting that lifelong urban residents had considerably lower fertility than their rural counterparts in the three years before the survey in each country, suggesting that there are indeed distinct urban and rural fertility regimes in the region which can be expected to impact on migrants' fertility as they move between areas.
While the DHS allow one to link fertility to the timing of migration, as in the following multivariate analysis, the data provide more limited insight into how migration affects proximate or underlying determinants of fertility. Aside from the information collected in retrospective birth histories, most other information collected from respondents relates to their status at the time of the survey, rather than to the pre-migration period or the time of migration. The most critical limitation of the data for this study is the lack of direct information on spousal separation around the time of migration, which presumably would have a dramatic impact on migrant fertility. Nevertheless, comparisons of current status indicators of migrant and nonmigrant women can illuminate some mechanisms through which ruralurban migration affects fertility, insofar as characteristics of migrants who differ in duration of residence at the time of the survey are suggestive of changes experienced by all migrant women with increased length of residence in the urban area.
Table 2 shows the per cent of married female visitors, migrants, and natives who were cohabiting with their husband at the time of the survey, and

Vol. 41, No. 1-2

the per cent of these women who were using a method of contraception. While living in a separate household from one's spouse does not necessarily imply great distance between spouses, particularly in societies where polygamy is common, it may also reflect separation as a result of the migration of one spouse, as well as the necessity of migrant couples to live temporarily in separate dwellings (e.g., with kin) upon entering the urban area until a permanent residence can be established. From the table it appears, on the whole, that women who visit towns and cities for short periods, for employment or other reasons, often leave their husbands behind in the village, whereas women who migrate to urban areas for longer periods are more likely to be joining their husbands. The similar or higher percentage of recent migrant (less than three years residence) than urban native women living with their husbands in each country suggests that spousal separation accounts for little if any fertility decline experienced by migrants after settling in the urban area. On the other hand, increased access to family planning services may have an immediate impact on the fertility of new urban residents. Among women living with their husbands, recent migrants were more likely than rural natives to be using contraception in each country. In Ghana, for example, 18 per cent of recent urban migrants were using contraception, compared to 9 per cent of rural natives, while in Uganda, about 15 per cent of recent migrants and only 4 per cent of rural natives used family planning. In each country except Mali, contraceptive use was moderately greater among longterm than recent migrants, which may

imply gradual adaptation to urban norms, constraints and opportunities that favor fertility regulation, or may simply reflect age or family-size differences between the migrant groups.
Table 3 presents socioeconomic, behavioral, and attitudinal characteristics of migrant and nonmigrant groups that may account for fertility differentials. In the three francophone countries examined, migrants are less educated than lifelong urban residents, reflecting the unavailability of schooling for women in much of rural Africa. Women who migrated to cities, however, particularly those who moved in the mid-1980's, were considerably more likely to have received schooling than women who remained in rural areas in each country, suggesting a possible inclination or receptiveness to lower fertility once settled in the city. Contrary to popular conceptions (Abu-Lughod, 1961; Adepoju, 1984; Lerner, 1967), migrants from the African countryside are not disadvantaged socioeconomically compared to more established urban residents and immediately achieve or surpass the standard of living of urban natives. While migrants are moderately disadvantaged in wealth and income in Senegal, and slightly disadvantaged in Mali, they quickly achieve similar economic levels as native women in Kenya and Togo, and slightly higher levels in Ghana and Uganda. Similarly, housing facilities of migrants, which may be suggestive of the social modernity of urban neighborhoods in which migrants reside, are clearly inferior to those of urban natives only in Senegal, and are superior in Ghana and Uganda. Comparison with rural natives indicates that throughout the

region women dramatically improve their economic status by migrating from the countryside to towns and cities, which may allow them to support more children, or conversely, may reduce the need to have many children as an income-earning or economic security strategy.

The cross-sectional comparisons in Table 3 also suggest that migrants from rural areas do not necessarily gradually adopt the shorter breastfeeding durations that are associated with urban areas and that could increase the risk of conception following migration. In four of the six countries, urban-born

children of recent migrants were breastfed for shorter periods than children of long-time migrants. On the whole, however, differences in duration of breastfeeding between urban and rural groups remain small and are unlikely to contribute substantially to fertility differentials. Only in Mali and Senegal, where they are the least welleducated, are migrant women less likely than natives to know where they can obtain a method of contraception and, in Senegal, to have contact with the modern health system. Likewise, migrants in the two Sahelian countries, and in Senegal their husbands or partners, are least likely to adopt as favorable an attitude toward family planning as urban natives, whereas elsewhere urban groups have similar attitudes concerning fertility regulation. In sum, rural-urban migrant women in Africa, even those who have only recently inmigrated, much more closely resemble the native urban than rural population in terms of personal characteristics that are indirectly or directly related to fertility.
MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS
MODEL AND VARIABLES
Logistic regression is used to analyze the risk of conceiving in the ten years preceding the survey in each country. Our model estimates migrants' risk of conception at various time periods before and after migration in relation to the risk of urban and rural nonmigrants. The model includes a set of demographic and socioeconomic variables commonly associated with fertility to assess whether migrantnonmigrant differences observed in

Table 1 are the result of differences in these other factors. The multivariate model thus provides more precise and comprehensive information on migration-fertility interrelations than the total fertility rates presented in Table 1, inasmuch as there is greater temporal coherence between migration and conception, a broader time frame is examined, the same migrant women are observed before and after migration, and possible explanations for migrant-native fertility differentials are considered.
Since the DHS do not provide information on date of divorce or separation, our sample is restricted to birth intervals of women whose first marriage was intact throughout the tenyear interval. Rural-to-rural migrants, who are of less interest to our study, and urban-to-rural migrants, who are too few to analyze, are excluded from the sample.
The model takes the following form:
ln(P/l-P) =p1Z + q1U+ rxM\ + r2M2 + r3M3 + r4M4 + sxM + s2N2 + s3N3,

Pi, q{, rl...ri,sl...s3 = parameters to be estimated.
N2 encompasses both the year before and the two years after migration due to the small number of women in our sample who moved between urban areas in each of these two periods.
The calendar period for exposure to the risk of conception is roughly similar for migrants and nonmigrants. For nonmigrants it is the entire ten-year period before the survey. For most migrants, the time periods before and after migration used in the analysis may have occurred at any time during the ten years, since migrants may have moved at any time in the ten years. However, women who migrated in the two years preceding the survey are excluded from the MAand A3 categories, and most of these women did not experience the full 23 months after migration represented by M3 and N2. Similarly, those women who migrated

nine to ten years before the survey were not exposed in the period 12 or more months before migration. We do not believe that this censoring has a substantial effect on our results.
The other independent variables included in the model are chosen on the basis of previous research that demonstrates their strong relationship with length of succeeding birth interval. The coding of these variables is presented in Table 4. We employ only one socioeconomic variable, level of female education, because other common socioeconomic determinants of fertility available in the DHS, such as proxies for household income (e.g., husband's occupation, ownership of consumer durables), are likely to have changed at some unidentifiable time between the pre-migration period and the time of the survey. Female schooling in subSaharan Africa, on the other hand, is typically completed before age 15, whereas mean age at migration to urban areas is no earlier than 24 in these surveys.
The negative effect of female education on fertility has been shown and explained in countless analyses of WFS data (United Nations, 1987; Cochrane and Farid, 1989; Ashurst et al., 1984) and will not be elaborated on here. In our analysis, the education variable is particularly critical to assess whether higher (or lower) migrant than nonmigrant fertility in the pre-migration period is a result of the pronounced differences in level of education between the groups observed in Table 3, and whether adaptation to lower fertility in the city is facilitated by or contingent on the woman having received schooling, as suggested elsewhere (Findley, 1982).

The three demographic variables included in the model--woman's age and parity at the beginning of the interval and the survival status of the child born at the beginning of the interval--have been used in virtually all recent studies of determinants of birth interval length. Each of these factors may have a greater effect on proximate determinants of fertility than factors associated with the migration process. Older women are less fecund and, along with high parity women, less likely to want additional children than women at an earlier stage of the reproductive life cycle, both of which conditions should result in longer or open-ended follow-

ing birth intervals. In some African settings, older women may also respect traditional abstinence rules more often and practice longer breastfeeding (Trussell et al., 1989). Analyses of survey data from a wide range of areas, including the Philippines (Akin et al., 1988), Peninsular Malaysia (DaVanzo and Starbird, 1991), Indonesia (Trussell et al., 1985), Kenya (Starbird et al., 1990) and nine countries surveyed by the WFS (Rodriguez et al., 1984) all show either a strong inverse relationship between age of mother at the start of the interval and her risk of conceiving or giving birth within the interval, or a positive relationship between age

and length of interval. The declining probability of conception with increasing birth order, on the other hand, is a sensible hypothesis that has been more often disproven than confirmed in multivariate analyses that account for other demographic influences on fertility (Rodriguez et al., 1984).
In settings where women exercise limited control over reproduction, such as those studied here, the death of the child born at the start of the interval can be expected to hasten a following conception primarily through the termination of breastfeeding in cases where the child died at a young age, and to a lesser extent through nonuse of contraception in order to replace the child (Mensch, 1985). In our analysis, we estimate the risk of conception associated with a child death at any age of child but before the mother has conceived the subsequent child.
RESULTS
Table 5 presents exponentiated parameter estimates of the risk of conception for migrants at different stages of the migration process and other results of the multivariate model. The estimates for migrants are also illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. Rural natives are used as the reference category in the analysis in order to emphasize distinctions in rural areas in the pre-migration period, e.g., the degree to which migrants are selected for higher or lower fertility. The brackets next to the estimates for migrants indicate whether these estimates are also significantly different from those of urban natives.
In the period more than one year before migration, migrant women had much higher fertility than women

who remained in the countryside in most countries. The risk of conception among rural-urban migrants was roughly twice that of rural stayers in Ghana, Mali, and Senegal, and almost three times as high in Uganda. Married women who migrated between urban areas also had significantly higher fertility than urban natives in Ghana and Senegal in this period. This high fertility of migrants a few years before migration may reflect, among some women, a deliberate attempt to have children after the decision to migrate has been made but before the women (or their husbands) leave the village. This might occur, for instance, if husbands migrate in advance of their wives to secure an income or establish residence in the city, if women have to satisfy the fertility expectations of husbands and kin prior to moving, or if there is an intention to complete breastfeeding before moving. Viewed differently, these estimates suggest that childbearing may instigate migration to urban areas among some women in these countries, if for example, the mother seeks the superior amenities (e.g., modern health care, schools) available for her young children in the town or city. In any case, the estimates strongly suggest that insofar as migrants experience lower fertility than nonmigrants after migration, this is not a result of migrants having been the low fertility segment of the population at origin.
Throughout Africa, migrant fertility declines dramatically around the time of migration. In each country except Togo, rural-urban migrants experience a substantial decrease in their risk of conception between the distant and immediate pre-migration periods. The

decline is most striking for migrants in Ghana and Kenya, falling to about one-third the level of rural stayers. One interpretation of this pattern is that women in many African societies do not migrate for long periods when they have infants, but only after their children are perceived as old enough to accompany them or be fostered-out by the migrant mother. In Togo, the decline in fertility occurs during the first two years in the urban area, when risks of migrants from rural areas are about 30 per cent lower than those of the native urban population (as in Uganda). Similarly, migrants between urban areas appear to experience a drop in their risk of conception around the time of migration in each country except Togo, although we can say this with confidence for only three countries (Ghana, Kenya, and Senegal). The implication is that migration to African towns and cities involves personal or situational changes that dramatically reduce fertility irrespective of national setting or migrant background.
These reproductive patterns in the time surrounding migration are no doubt due in part to the temporary spousal separation that often accompanies migration throughout sub-Saharan Africa, particularly migration to towns and cities (Adepoju, 1984). The extremely low risk of conception among migrants in Ghana and Kenya just prior to migration suggests that husbands of migrants may have already departed for the urban area, as has been the historical pattern of family migration in these countries (Caldwell, 1969; Ominde, 1968) as well as elsewhere in the region (O'Connor, 1983). In cases where the couple migrates together, it is plausible that they choose

not to conceive after they have decided to move, in order to facilitate the move and not give birth in unfamiliar surroundings. An alternative explanation for the low risk in Ghana and Kenya is that pregnant women do not migrate, in order to preserve their own and their child's health and to receive support from family and kin during delivery and immediately following childbirth. The lower risk of conception of migrants than rural natives around the time of migration in the non-Sahelian countries is also consistent with the greater use of contraception among migrants than rural women as observed in Table 2.
After having lived in the new urban locality for two or more years, the fertility of migrants from both rural and urban areas closely approximates the fertility of native urban women in four of the countries--Ghana, Kenya, Mali, and Senegal. In the other two countries, Togo and Uganda, ruralurban migrants have a significantly lower risk of conception after living two years in urban areas than urban natives. A significant increase, or "catching up," in fertility following the dramatic decrease around the time of migration is observed only among urban-urban migrants in Ghana, Kenya, and Togo, and these increases are modest. The continued low fertility of urban migrants over time suggests that, in addition to postponement of childbearing due to spousal separation or other factors, a desire to have fewer children or even terminate childbearing may account for much of the decrease in conception we observe around the time of migration as well as in subsequent years. To the extent that such reproductive control is exercised

Vol. 41, No. 1-2

Migration and Fertility in Africa

39

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:45 08 December 2015

by migrant women, it does not appear attributable to advanced age or high completed fertility.
In contrast to the early premigration period, when rural-urban migrants in most countries experienced much higher fertility than rural nonmigrants, after living in the city for several years women who left the countryside experienced a 24 to 49 per cent lower risk of conception than rural natives in the four non-Sahelian countries. In all six countries, the risk among migrants was also significantly lower after two years of urban residence than in the initial pre-migration period (test not shown), often by large amounts. Although one can only speculate what migrants' fertility would have been had they remained in rural areas, these results do suggest that factors associated with the process of migration to African towns and cities reduce migrant fertility, and probably contribute to the much lower urban than rural fertility observed in African countries.
In the absence of information on migrants' reproductive attitudes or intentions over time, one cannot accurately assess the relative importance of migrant selectivity in rural areas and migrants' adjustment to the urban environment in determining their lower fertility in African towns and cities. To the extent that women move to urban areas to pursue smaller family size, these intentions are probably most prevalent among rural women who have received some schooling. An interaction term not included in our final model, however, revealed that migrants' risk of conception after living in the urban area for two years does not significantly differ according to their

level of education in any of the countries analyzed. It seems more plausible that many migrant women intend to pursue large families or have additional children soon after settling in the urban area, but are either circumscribed by structural forces common to urban settings--limited housing space and land, high costs of raising children, greater income-earning opportunities for women--that limit the number of children an urban couple can support, or gradually modify their reproductive preferences as a result of exposure to groups or institutions that favor lower fertility.
Whereas Table 1 showed that urban and rural nonmigrants experienced very different levels of fertility in the 1980's, the multivariate analysis reveals significantly lower fertility for urban natives only in Kenya. Thisfinding is not surprising, insofar as the female populations in rural and urban areas of Africa are known to differ considerably in terms of factors included in this model that impact on the timing or level of fertility; on average, rural women are younger, commence childbearing earlier, experience higher child mortality, and are less educated than urban women. As expected, older age, high parity, survival of the child born at the beginning of the interval, and schooling each reduce a woman's risk of conceiving in most countries, confirming previous findings from the region (Starbird et al., 1990). Notably, women have a considerably higher risk of conceiving at parity one than at parity two to four when one considers also whether they are age thirty or older, reflecting that many women in the region do limit their family size. It is also worth noting that in each country

40

Brockerhoff and Yang

Social Biology

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:45 08 December 2015

where female education lowers the risk of fertility, this reduction occurs from primary schooling, but further substantial reductions result from secondary school education. In sum, however, we conclude that factors associated with migrants, rural or urban areas of Africa, or the process of migration that are not included in our model result in distinct patterns of fertility among migrants over the course of the migration process.
SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
Of the hypotheses tested in this study, the one most strongly confirmed is that factors associated with migration to African towns and cities lead to a decline in fertility around the time of migration, i.e., the "disruption" perspective. This decline is apparent in all of the states examined, is pronounced, and is experienced by both urban- and rural-origin migrants. Unfortunately, the DHS provide limited information on the mechanisms involved in this decline, although it is probable that temporary spousal separation is a predominant cause.
Several notable characteristics of migrant fertility observed in Asian and Latin American settings are not found in these sub-Saharan African countries. Low migrant fertility following the change from rural to urban residence, experienced throughout the region, is not the result of migrants having been the low fertility segment of the rural population prior to departure. On the contrary, there is evidence in some countries that female rural-urban migrants tend to be women

who have experienced high fertility in the past. The notion of gradual adaptation of migrants from the countryside to the lower fertility of lifetime urban residents is also not found in Africa: The decline in migrant fertility to levels approximating those of urban natives is immediate (sometimes even preceding migration), and migrants from rural areas do not take longer to experience lower fertility than migrants from other urban areas. This implies that, despite the enormous difference in standard of living between urban and rural areas in virtually every African country, urban and rural life may not differ so much for women in terms of types or degree of social contacts, economic activities, living arrangements or other socioeconomic or cultural factors as to make rapid personal adjustment to the new environment difficult. Moreover, the almost universal exposure of rural residents in Africa to aspects of urban life through association with return migrants or their own circulation between urban and rural areas probably results in a high degree of what Hanna and Hanna (1981) call "anticipatory socialization" among prospective migrants --an adoption of norms, values, and behaviors associated with the urban environment while the migrant is still living in the village. In this context, low migrant fertility in urban areas is not unexpected.
While the commonly perceived consequences of heavy in-migration to African cities--pressure on housing, services, and income-earning opportunities--may be real, immediate and persistent low migrant fertility in urban areas suggests that urban migrants have a more modest impact on long-

term urban growth in the region thanis often argued (Adepoju, 1986). Moreover, the apparent reduction in fertility that accompanies rural-urban migration implies that migration to cities may contribute to lower national population growth, had migrants continued to have higher fertility in ruralareas if they had not moved.
Limitations of the DHS data do not allow one toexplore in detail the social or behavioral mechanisms through which fertility patterns are modified at different stages of the migration process. Nevertheless, thefindingspresented here clearly show that migrant fertility does undergo dramatic change

over time and raise additional questions worthy offurther research. Foremost among these are: Is female migration to African towns and citiesfor long periods motivated by a desire to have small families (i.e., low fertility)? What isthe extent and length of spousal separation associated with longterm female migration tourban areas? To what extent do structural characteristics associated with urban environments limit the number of children a woman or couple canhave? Both indepth migration surveys and more qualitative research approaches should be considered in order to address these questions satisfactorily.
