ABSTRACT: In a large sample of girls admitted to the University of Warwick, 1971-81, physique, as measured by height, weight, and ponderal index, was examined in relation to family variables and socioeconomic class. Not only do girls of different social classes enter the university at different average ages, but also the family size from which they come varies. There are differences between social classes in mean height, and the secular trend to increasing height continues.

Chamla (1983), drawing together data on secular trends 1960-80 in height in young adults in Western European countries, was unable to find any relevant material covering this period from Britain where, although there have been several growth studies of children since the war (e.g., Douglas, 1964;Douglas et al., 1965; Miller et al., 1972), there is relatively little information on diachronic variation in body size and shape in the older age groups. A previous twelve-year study of Swansea University students (Roberts and Dann, 1975; Dann and Roberts, 1976) indicated a tendency to increasing height and linearity, partly due to changes in the regional derivation of the students in the sample. It appeared of interest to report a further series of cross-sectional studies among university students, which investigated whether secular trends in body size and shape are still continuing and whether socioeconomic differences in physique persist, and how they are related to other factors in the family environment.

MATERIALS AND METHOD
The subjects were 3,496 girls, admitted to the University of Warwick during the eleven-year period 1971-81. They were all born between 1946 and 1964, the majority between 1953 and 1964, and at admission they were between the ages of 17 and 28, with the great majority between 18 and 20. The sample included no girls born outside Britain, and no girls were colored. All were measured in their first six months of residence by the same observer, using the same instruments and giving the same instructions to each, e.g., for stature to stand as upright as possible and to look horizontally before her. Final adjustment of the head into the Frankfurt plane was completed by touch. Thus, the variation included no inter-observer or inter-instrument error, and there is no reason to suppose any consistent trend in intra-observer or posing error over the years in which the work was undertaken. All measuring was done between 1000 and 1600 hours, and the

same numbers of girls were measured each morning and afternoon session at the end as at the beginning of the survey; diurnal variation may therefore contribute slightly to the variance in stature, but no consistent trend is likely.
The following independent variables were considered for each girl:

plumpest to 15.14 for the most slender.
These variables were examined by analysis of variance and multiple regression techniques.
RESULTS

The following dependent variables were considered separately:
Yx Height in centimeters, measured to the nearest centimetre, which ranged from 137 to 184;
Yi Weight, measured in kilograms, which ranged from 34 to 108;
Y s The ponderal index, measured as stature over the cube root of weight which gives a measure of the linearity of physique and which ranged from 10.62 for the

The means and standard deviations for each variable by social class (X4) are given in Table 1. Analysis of variance shows that the classes differ highly significantlyin each of the social variables. It seems that girls of Social Class I enter the university at an average age older by ten months than those of Social Class II, by one year and 11 months than those of Social Class III and IV, but only by 11 months than those of Social Class V. This may be due to secular trends in the sample, with enrollment of an increasing proportion of girls from Classes III and IV. Girls of Social Class V tend to come from larger families than do the remainder, and their position in the family is also later. However, girls of Social Class I also come from slightly larger families than those of Classes II, III, and IV. As regards physique, there are again highly significant differences between classes in mean height, with the girls of Social Classes I and II being slightly

ficant negative correlation with social class, but with no other variable. On account of these intercorrelations, a multiple regression analysis was undertaken of each dependent variable on the four independent (Table 4). Stature shows a significantly increasing secular trend and an increase with social class, while there is also a somewhat disturbing significant diminution with the number of sibs. This social class effect on height is independent of the secular trend. The ponderal index shows a tendency to increased linearity in the upper social classes. Of the variables in the weight regression, only position in family exerts an effect that is barely significant. Of the three overall regressions, only two (stature and ponderal index) are significant (F = 8.22, p < 0.0001; F = 4.66, p < 0.001, respectively), but the low multiple correlation coefficients indicate how slight is the proportion of total variance in the physique variables to be attributed to the socioeconomic variables, barely 1per cent in height, 0.50 per cent in ponderal index, and 0.25 per cent in weight.
Since it may not be valid to treat the socioeconomic classification as a numerical variable, the interrelationships were

examined within social classes by covariance analysis. The regression coefficients within social class and their standard errors are given in Table 5. They differ little from those in Table 4, though for all three variables there is a very slight increase in the multiple correlation coefficients. The results as expected are very similar to those of the initial analysis of variance. Though small, the effect of social class on physique, primarily through the effect on stature, appears well established.
The occurrence of regional variations in physique in Britain has been recognized for more than a century, and the differences pointed out by Beddoe in 1870 remained in the 1940's, with gradients of increasing stature and weight as one moved south and east across the United Kingdom (Roberts, 1953). In the years covered by the present survey, the University of Warwick was expanding, and it is possible that such expansion might have brought a change in composition of the sample. Examination of the students by region of origin shows indeed highly significant differences in stature. Considering only regions where the numbers are sufficiently large, we find the smallest statures occur

in girls from Wales and northern England, and the tallest statures in those counties to the southeast of London and from the southwest of the country. Weight and ponderal index show no significant regional variation. Mean stature, weight, and ponderal index was calculated for each year's intake, weighted according to the proportion of girls from each region. These show no trends comparable with the actual means observed. A similar calculation of the means for each year weighted by social class, also showed no trend comparable with those observed, so neither differential representation of the regions nor of the social class is responsible for the diachronic variation in stature.

DISCUSSION
COMPARISON WITH THE SWANSEA SERIES
These results are directly comparable with those from the Swansea survey, for the data were obtained by the same observer using the same procedures. There are considerable differences from the Swansea results. In Warwick, all the social variables differ between classes. First, a striking contrast is the later age of entry of girls of Social Classes 1 and 2 by comparison with those of 3, 4 and 5, perhaps due to the tendency of the former to take a year attempting scholarship level work at school or gaining nonacademic experience in travel or in employment before commencing their university career. Secondly, reflecting the post-war fertility boom, family size is consistently greater than in Swansea, but in the Warwick data, while the smallest family size again occurs in Social Class 3, the larger family size of So-

cial Class 5 is very obvious. Thirdly, in the physique variables, though the results are very similar, with a clear class gradient in height but not in weight, giving the different average morphologies, the Warwick girls are consistently taller than the Swansea girls, the mean difference increasing in the lower socioeconomic groups. The mean weight is slightly lower in Classes 1,2, and 4, but rather greater in Class 5, and the result is a slightly more linear physique in all five classes in Warwick. The associations of stature with year of birth and social class are about the same in Warwick as in Swansea, as shown by the zero-order correlations, but those of ponderal index are less close. The effects of the social variables on height, as shown by the regression coefficients, are consistently greater in Warwick, by a factor of 4 for birth year and a factor of 2 for the remainder. The secular change in weight has disappeared, and the effect of social class on ponderal index has increased. There has been a slight decrease in the multiple correlation coefficients in all three variables.
INTERPRETATION
The obvious differences in height among the socioeconomic classes attracted social investigators in Europe in the nineteenth century, such as Villerme in France and Chadwick in England, to use stature to trace changes in economic and social conditions. Tanner (1955, 1966,1982) has repeatedly drawn attention to the usefulness of growth data for monitoring social and economic environments and, recognizing this, the National Bureau of Economic Research in America recently sponsored an examination of economic and social trends as indicated by secular change in height. It

established that the changing pattern of height of American whites, and its relationship to socioeconomic differences, is substantially different from that in most European populations (Fogel et al., 1982). The historical data that are available show that the secular trend in height, while generally positive, has at times been negative.
One interpretation, then, of the general trend toward earlier menarcheal age that occurred in Britain until about twenty years ago, and toward greater stature at .a given age, was that these were a reflection of improvement in environmental conditions. The cessation of the downward menarcheal age trend (Roberts and Dann, 1975) and its apparent replacement by an upward movement in the subjects here analyzed (Dann and Roberts, 1984) could be seen as possibly indicating deterioration in those environmental factors that affect growth and development in Britain. The present finding of a secular trend toward increasing stature provides some reassurance. Yet this perhaps is not as solidly based as it may at first seem. Factors to consider are that the present sample relates to a selected and possibly privileged section of the population which may not be representative of the whole. Whether or not differences in height observed between social classes in this study are due to environmental or genetic differences, the diminution in stature within families with increase in number of sibs is not likely to be genetic. It parallels the tendency toward later menarcheal age with sibship size, and it is noticeable that the regression coefficient of height on position in family is negative only in Social Class 5 in this study. This suggests that in some sections of the community their situation as regards the

factors that affect growth and maturation may still be quite marginal.
Whatever the cause, the present study reveals an interesting discrepancy in that social class differences apparently continue to occur in stature but not in menarcheal age. The results are in agreement with other recent reports. No class differences in menarcheal age were found in two studies in northern England, respectively, in a depressed industrialized and a middle-class residential urban area (Roberts, et al., 1971; Roberts, et al., 1975). As regards physique, however, Billewicz et al. (1983) showed that in Newcastle upon Tyne adolescents at age 15 both boys' and girls' height, and particularly leg length, tended to diminish with father's occupational status and with family size. Smith et al., (1980) showed that differences of attained height by social (occupational) class and family size persisting in 5- to 10-year-old children, are already well established by age 5 years; in boys also, skinfold thicknesses and arm circumference diminished with family size. In other countries the situation varies. There is generally an inverse relationship between social class and obesity in adults in the United States and Western European countries (Baird, Silverstone, et al., 1974; Oken et al., 1977; Ravelli and Belmont, 1979) and sometimes in children (Stonkard et al., 1972; White-

law, 1971; Wilkinson et al., 1977), but others have not observed this relationship (Rona and Chinn, 1982; Garn et al., 1975). Differences in height between socioeconomic groups in Oslo schoolchildren seem to have disappeared (Brundtland, 1980). It seems that in the United Kingdom, while the environmental, and particularly general care and nutritional, differences that distinguished the socioeconomic classes and possibly influenced menarcheal age have today disappeared, those affecting stature have not. Rona et al (1978) noted that in primary schoolchildren biological factors (parental height and birth weight in particular) contributed much more to the variance of height than did social factors (social class, family size, and employment status) and so did Billewicz's material. This suggests that genetic differences between classes affecting stature remain. This is not to imply that all environmental restriction on growth has been removed; instead, it is to be sought between families within classes, rather than between classes.
