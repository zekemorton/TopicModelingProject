ABSTRACT: In Turner syndrome, there is a high incidence of neurocognitional impairment specific to the mental processing and sequencing of rotational transformations of shapes in the spatial dimensions of left-right, up-down, and back-front. In Klinefelter syndrome, the corresponding neurocognitional impairment is specific to the mental processing of sequence and synchrony in the temporal dimension, including the temporal dimension of language.

Some pediatric endocrine syndromes are characterized by multiple anomalies, one of which may be a neurocognitional impairment that affects IQ and learning. In such syndromes, all the anomalies stem ultimately from the same source which may be, for example, a traumatic or endogenous brain lesion, a hormone-secreting tumor, an infection, or a genetic anomaly. In the pediatric endocrine clinic, two genetic anomalies affecting the actual sex chromosomal number are particularly frequent: the 45,X (Turner) syndrome and the 47,XXY (Klinefelter) syndrome. In Turner syndrome, there is a high incidence of neurocognitional impairment specific to rotational transformation in the spatial dimension. In Klinefelter syndrome, the corresponding impairment is specific to sequence and synchrony in the temporal dimension.

45,X (TURNER) SYNDROME
In this syndrome, in all of its chromosomal variations (affecting an estimated 1:5000 newborn girls), the neurocognitional impairment that may affect intelligence and learning is in evidence throughout childhood. Thus, there is no doubt that its existence is coexistent with, but not dependent on inert gonadal streaks that fail to secrete gonadal hormones at puberty.
The error of embryogenesis responsible for the differentiation of gonadal streaks instead of ovaries is responsible also for other deformities that occur not universally, but sporadically in Turner embryos. One of these additional sporadically occurring errors will ultimately impair intelligence and learning. One infers, therefore, that it must be an error of brain differentiation. If there are regional or hemi-

spheric localizations, they have not yet been demonstrated.
For a quarter century after Turner first described the syndrome, impairment of intellect and learning, if present, was mislabeled as mental retardation. The correct label, specific cognitional deficit, was discovered in the course of psychohormonal testing (Shaffer, 1962) in the Psychohormonal Unit of the Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Clinic at The Johns Hopkins Hospital and has since been confirmed in many studies. It is widely agreed that, whereas the deficit does not affect verbal intelligence, it may severely affect nonverbal intelligence. The disparity between verbal and nonverbal (performance) IQ's may be as great as 30 points, with the verbal IQ being above 130.
By pooling and comparing the data drawn from various studies based either on standardized psychological tests (e.g., Money, 1964; Bekker and Van Gemund, 1968; Garron, 1977; Nielsen et al., 1977) or on special tests (e.g., Alexander and Money, 1966;Silbert et al., 1977; Waber, 1979; Rovet and Netley, 1982; McCauley et al., 1987), it may be construed that the basic deficiency pertains to the mental processing and sequencing of rotational transformations of shapes in the spatial dimensions of left-right, updown, and back-front. The latter is also the push-pull rotation which rotates the self-image, as in a mirror. In the activities of everyday life, the rotational transformation deficit translates into a handicap in map reading, following travel directions, drawing a floor plan of a familiar room, deciphering sounds stereophonically, and recognizing changes in facial expression.

In psychological testing, rotational transformation wreaks havoc on the drawing of a person. This test necessitates rotational transformation of the self-image onto a flat page on which the left and right of the figure depicted before one's very eyes is a mirror rotation of one's own left and right.
The mirror rotational effect interferes also with copying either a human figure or a geometric shape (Alexander et al., 1966). The rotation of angles and points has the effect of turning the shape that they define inside out (for example, the points of a triangle become pouches) and creates more evidence of distortion than does the rotation of curves.
The link between rotational disability and shapes apparently extends from geometry to calculation in general. Mathematics is a great academic stumbling block for Turner girls. It frequently necessitates intervention from the physician, in order to obtain from the school a special dispensation so that a verbally superior Turner student will not be penalized for a genetically derived specific nonverbal disability.
Vocationally, as well as academically, rotational transformation disability is a handicap in all assignments that involve arrangements and rotations of designs and configurations. With accumulated experience, a Turner girl's degree of handicap may be lessened by the device of transliterating from shapes and directions into silently spoken language.
Rotational transformation disability is not a handicap to learning to read. It may even be an advantage, insofar as the shapes of letters and words retain their meanings by remaining stable and not rotated. Those with rotational

disability do not transform "b" into "d," or "p" into "q," etc. The psychological law of object constancy dictates that the meaning of a shape or object perceived remains constant, even if it is turned around or upside down, or added to, or subtracted from, or broken (Alexander and Money, 1967; Money, 1967). The ordinary child, in learning to read, has to resist the law of object constancy. Turner girls are spared this resistance.
47,XXY (KLINEFELTER) SYNDROME
In this syndrome intelligence may or may not be impaired. Impairment, if present, is evident prepubertally, prior to the manifestation of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism that characterizes the syndrome from puberty onward.
Epidemiologically, the incidence of intellectual impairment among 47,XXY males is a function of the type of population cytogenetically screened. When large-scale screening began in the 1960's, the focus was on males segregated in penal, psychiatric, and mental retardation institutions. In each type of institution, the proportion of 47,XXY males was in excess of the estimated 1:900 ratio that would be found among newborn boys. So also was the proportion of 47,XXY males with a below-average or defective IQ. It required cytogenetic screening of males in infertility clinics, and subsequently in newborn nurseries, to show that the majority of 47,XXY males are of average and sometimes superior IQ. Even though average, however, the IQ may have been several points higher without the supernumerary X

chromosome--and this does appear to be the case when 47,XXY males as a group are compared with, say, their 46, XY siblings, or a matched 46,XY control group (Theilgaard et al., 1971).
It became evident, from early in the 1970's onwards, that the missing IQ points are more often missing from the Verbal IQ than the nonverbal or Performance IQ. Specific linguistic disability is more pronounced in some 47,XXY males than others. In some 47,XXY boys, the disability is manifested early in infancy as a developmental delay in the use of speech. It may be severe enough to require speech therapy. Later in childhood it may be manifested pedagogically as a learning disability specific for reading (dyslexia) and spelling.
Oral and written language development was followed prospectively (Graham et al., 1988) in fourteen boys who had been identified as 47.XXY in a New England neonatal screening program. They were compared with fifteen 46,XY control boys when they were between the ages of nine and ten, at which age they were academically at the transition between third and fourth grade. On the basis of a broad spectrum of tests, it was concluded that linguistic disability in 47,XXY boys is characterized by deficits in processing the rate and order of auditory stimuli, and in word finding, narrative sequencing, and arranging meanings syntactically.
The hypothesis that linguistic disability might be lateralized in one hemisphere of the brain was experimentally investigated (Netley, 1988) in a cohort of 23 prepubertal boys (average age, 10--11 years) who had been identified as 47,XXY in a Canadian
