ABSTRACT: Disclosures that this decade has had the five hottest years ever recorded globally raise concern that extreme temperatures might be associated with higher mortality. An analysis of fluctuations in annual cause-specific deaths, seasonal temperatures, and annual income per capita in Massachusetts, Michigan, Washington, Utah, North Carolina, and Mississippi, 1930 to 1985, suggests that, on the contrary, a temperature increase throughout the year was associated with fewer deaths from all causes combined, including deaths from infectious diseases, heart diseases, cerebrovascular diseases, pneumonia, and influenza. An average temperature increase of one degree Fahrenheit was associated with a more than 2 per cent decline in deaths from pneumonia and influenza. The only category of deaths showing no significant association was death from malignant neoplasms. Compared to spring, summer, and fall temperature fluctuations, unusually cold winter temperatures had the strongest fatal effects, but only in North Carolina and Mississippi. The greatest cumulative temperature effects on mortality were found in the same two states. Controlling for annual fluctuations in income per capita did not influence the relationship between temperature and mortality. There was evidence suggesting that the level of wealth ameliorated the fatal effects of extreme temperatures. In conclusion, unusually warm weather was followed by fewer deaths; unusually cold weather, by more deaths.

There is a rich literature about the seasonality of temperature and its effect on mortality. Many studies have focused on the effects of unusually low temperatures in the winter and higher than usual temperatures in the summer (Ellis, 1972; Lloyd, 1986) In both the United States and Europe, an increase in the number of deaths has been recorded after winter cold spells and summer hot spells. Since increases in temperature produce opposite effects on mortality in the summer and the winter, it is of interest to determine what the effect of a year-long high or low temperature would be on mortality. A previous study (Larsen, 1989) showed that overall mortality (the crude death rate) in the

United States from 1921 to 1985 was higher in July and August when the weather was warmer than usual, while during the rest of the year unusually warm weather was followed by lower overall mortality. However, different causes of death are probably not equally sensitive to temperature fluctuations.
This study aims to clarify whether deaths in the United States from some diseases (cardiovascular) are systematically more greatly affected by extreme temperatures than are deaths from other diseases (malignant neoplasms). The present analysis is confined to examining fluctuations in annual causespecific deaths, because, at the state level, statistics about cause of death

were recorded only on a yearly basis until 1968 (National Center for Health Statistics). Monthly temperature data are available. However, we create four seasonal temperature variables, which enables us to obtain a more parsimonious model and to take into account seasonal differences in the relationship between short-term fluctuations in temperature and mortality.
In general, the number of deaths from cardiovascular diseases and cerebrovascular accidents are higher subsequent to a summer heat wave and to a winter cold wave (Lloyd, 1986; Vuori, 1987). Keatingeetal. (1984) suggest one mechanism by which cold can cause deaths from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Subjects exposed to cold have increases in cell volume, circulating platelets, and viscosity of the blood, all factors which increase blood pressure and may contribute to an increased risk of death from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Deaths from respiratory diseases are found to increase significantly after unusually cold fall and winter weather, probably due to an increased incidence and transmission of viral infections (Bull and Morton, 1978; Leppaluoto, 1984; Lloyd, 1986). There is also evidence that susceptibility to infectious diseases is increased during warm weather, and that summer heat waves may be followed by an unusual number of deaths from infectious diseases (Howe, 1972). The relationship between short-term fluctuations in temperature and cause-specific mortality has been documented in a time-series analysis of historical London (Galloway, 1985). However, findings from historical populations may not apply to contemporary America under prevailing conditions of advanced medical technology, good housing facilities,

high hygiene, and sanitary food storage. Also, the major categories of causespecific deaths (e.g., cardiovascular diseases and diseases of the heart) in twentieth-century America are different from those in historical London (e.g., typhus and tuberculosis).
Possible significant relationships between short-term fluctuations in temperature and mortality concerns individuals as well as public health policy makers. For instance, the summer of 1988 was exceptionally hot in many areas of the United States, and the news media announced repeatedly that many deaths could be avoided if people prone to suffering from heat waves (cardiac patients and elderly people in general) were provided financial aid to install air conditioners. A careful analysis of the relationship between temperature changes and cause-specific deaths is needed in order to support arguments for such aid.
Whether improvements in factors such as housing, heating, air conditioning, and clothing can reduce fatal effects of extreme temperatures concerns both Americans and Europeans and has been debated in Lancet.The Editor ofLancet stated in the November 2, 1985 issue that "it is by no means certain that further improvement in house heating would have a great impact on mortality," while Dr. Lloyd responded in the December 21,1985 issue that "improvement of the thermal environment, not only in housing but also at work, might strikingly reduce the winter excess of deaths in the UK." The fatal impact of extreme temperatures may be influenced by the level of wealth (e.g., the general housing standard), but it may also be affected by short-term economic fluctuations, in that many people may not be able to afford appropriate heat-

tion or a subgroup. Furthermore, changes in the population are slow and trendlike, and the trends in the series are explicitly modelled, and then removed by first differencing (as described below). Finally, most of the variation from one year to the next takes place in the numerator (the deaths), while variation in the denominator (the population size) tends to be relatively small if the population is relatively large.
TEMPERATURE
The average monthly temperature in Fahrenheit for one station in each state is used (Climatological Data; Report of the Chief of the Weather Bureau). The selected stations are located in Boston, Detroit, Seattle, Salt Lake City, Charlotte, and Vicksburg, respectively, in Massachusetts, Michigan, Washington, Utah, North Carolina, and Mississippi. There might be differences in the level of the temperature within a state, but the monthly fluctuations are very similar. For each state from 1930to 1955,the temperature read at the selected station and an average measure based on readings from many stations are highly correlated. The average measure is not published after 1955.
We create four temperature variables, one for each season. The average temperature in the winter (average of January, February, and March) spring (average of April, May, and June), summer (average of July, August, and September), and fall (average of October, November, and December). The four seasonal temperature variables are constructed so that they measure associations between warmer-than-usual winter weather and lower mortality, and between warmer-than-usual summer weather and higher mortality (Larsen, 1989), and so that they are comparable

to the temperature variables used by other researchers (Eckstein et al., 1985; Galloway, 1985).
INCOME PERCAPITA
Short-term fluctuations in the economy are measured byfluctuationsin income per capita by state of residence (Bureau of Economic Analysis). Massachusetts has the highest level of wealth according to income per capita, followed by Michigan, Washington, Utah, North Carolina, and Mississippi.
METHOD
Yearly fluctuations in mortality may be caused by many factors. If all other variables were fixed, and only the temperature varied, one could establish the relationship of yearly fluctuations in mortality and temperature. The temperature and mortality relationship is not affected by other variables, as long as these other variables are orthogonal to temperature. In most cases temperature is an exogenous variable. It might, therefore, be valid to analyze a model of only temperature and mortality. Medical technology, housing, diet, etc., improved during 1930 to 1985, and as a consequence the fatal effects of temperature fluctuations may have declined over time. To include this change, the interaction of temperature and time is added to the model, and so is the state and temperature interaction to account for variation in the relationship between temperature and mortality by state of residence.
We cannot discount the possibility that the effects of yearly temperature fluctuations on mortality are confounded by extraneous variables. For example, it may be argued that temperature fluctuations can affectfluctuations in wealth, e.g., unusually cold winter

RESULTS
As a first step, parsimonious models of deaths by cause and temperature are developed, and the impact of controlling for annual fluctuations in income per capita is examined. Next, the cumulative temperature effect on mortality, the seasonal pattern, and the time lags between temperature and mortality are analyzed.
PARSIMONIOUS MODELSELECTION
The statistical measures used to determine whether a variable adds significantly to the model are presented in Table 2. Here, the discussion centers on the substantive issues considered in the model building. We hypothesize that seasonal temperature fluctuations affect mortality significantly, that the effects of temperature on mortality vary over time

from 1930 to 1985, and by state of residence. Furthermore, controlling for annual fluctuations in income per capita may affect the relationship between mortality and temperature.
The form of any trend in the relation of mortality to temperature from 1930to 1985 is unknown. Hence, we examine whether there is a linear trend, or whether there is no trend within the periods 1930-39,1940-49,. . . ,1970-85. We examine also whether the effects of temperature on mortality differed between only the period after 1950, and the period 1950 and earlier. Wefindthat there is no linear trend. A fixed trend 1930-39, 1940-49, etc., fits the data best, although including a trend improves the fit significantly only for deaths from cerebrovascular diseases, and from pneumonia and influenza.

significant in the GROSS models are generally also significant in the NET models, and the size of each coefficient is almost the same in the GROSS and NET models, suggesting that controlling for income per capita fluctuations does not affect the relationship between temperature and mortality.

1985. Deaths are in particular affected by temperature fluctuations in North Carolina and Mississippi. These two states rank lowest with respect to the level of income per capita. Hence, it may be that the level of wealth, and not fluctuations in wealth, ameliorates the fatal effects of extreme temperatures.

LAGGED SUMMED TEMPERATURE
EFFECTS, SEASONAL PATTERNS AND TIME
LAGS BETWEEN TEMPERATURE AND
CAUSE OF DEATH
In general, a temperature increase is followed by lower mortality, and vice versa (Figure 1). (The following results are from the NET models.) Fluctuations in the temperature affect deaths from pneumonia and influenza, in particular, and deaths from other infectious diseases. For instance, an increase in the winter, spring, summer and fall temperature of one degree Fahrenheit is associated with more than a 2 per cent decrease in the number of deaths from pneumonia and influenza in the period 1970 to 1985 in each state examined. In contrast, in each state, the number of deaths from malignant neoplasms responds less than 0.5 per cent to a one degree Fahrenheit temperature change in the entire period 1930 to 1985. The association between temperature and causespecific death changed from 1930 to 1985 only for deaths from cerebrovascular diseases, pneumonia, and influenza. Specifically, warmer-than-usual summer weather was followed by more deaths from cerebrovascular diseases in the decade 1930 to 1939, while a reverse and weak association prevailed after 1940; deaths from pneumonia and influenza responded less to unusually cold winter weather from 1950 to 1959 relative to the years 1930 to 1949 and 1960 to

Mortality is most responsive to a one degree Fahrenheit increase in the winter temperature in Mississippi (Figure 2). In Mississippi deaths from all causes, except malignant neoplasms, are associated with more than a 0.5 per cent decline following a one degree Fahrenheit increase in the winter temperature in the same year. For cerebrovascular deaths the one-year delayed winter temperature effects cancel the immediate effects, while the one-year delayed effects are negligible for the other causes of death considered. It should be noted that fluctuations in the winter temperature have a minor effect on mortality in the states of Massachusetts, Michigan, Washington, and Utah. To explain the differentials in the associations between temperature and cause-specific death by state of residence, more research is required.
The fatal effects of temperature fluctuations in the spring, summer, and fall do not vary significantly by state of residence for any of the categories of causespecific death examined (Figure 3). Furthermore, the changes in cause-specific deaths following fluctuations in spring, summer, and fall temperatures are negligible compared to the winter patterns found in North Carolina and Mississippi. Similar seasonal patterns were obtained in the analysis of monthly crude death rates, with the exception that higher-than-usual temperatures were associated with more deaths in the months

CONCLUSION
The mainfindingofthis study isthat a year-long temperature increase is followed by lower mortality, and correspondingly a decrease in temperature is followed byhigher mortality. This is the case for allcause-of-death categoriesexamined, with the exception of deaths from malignant neoplasms which do not respond to temperature fluctuations. The association between mortality and temperature did not generally change from 1930 to 1985. Unusually warm summer weather is found not to befollowed by more deaths, as suggested in our previous study (Larsen, 1989), probably because annual mortality data

are used herein, which can obscureseasonal effects. For example, years with unusually warm summer weather have often warmer-than-usual weather throughout the year, and the excess of deaths following the summer heat may be cancelled bythelower mortality associated with warmer-than-usual weather during therest of the year. Tobetter disentangle the seasonal patterns between fluctuations in cause-specific deaths and temperature, we need daily, weekly, or monthly data bystate of residence or by county. TheMortality Detail Files(National Center for Health Statistics)provide such data from 1968and forward, and several cross-section analyses could be conducted.

Hence, this analysis draws added policy relevance from the fact that substantial funds have been set aside in the federal budget by the Low Income Energy Assistance Act for expenditure to offset the effects on mortality of weather variation.

The finding that year-long unusually warm weather is associated with fewer deaths, and vice versa, does not clarify whether mortality will fall or rise subsequent to a global warming trend, such as predicted by the greenhouse theory. Inferences from annual fluctuations to changes lasting many decades can be hazardous. The mortality responses to seasonal temperature fluctuations are probably greater than to long-term weather changes, because cultural and economic adjustments (improvements in housing, air conditioning, clothing, etc.) can be made to accommodate peo-
