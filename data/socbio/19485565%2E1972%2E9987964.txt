In spite of the appreciable controversy over and interest in abortion in the United States, there has been relatively little research on the factors influencing the attitudes people adopt toward abortion legalization. An early investigation was a 1965 national public opinion poll by the National Opinion Research Center in which approximately 1,500 adult Americans were asked their views on the conditions under which a woman should be able to obtain a legal abortion. Approval rates for six conditions were: if the woman's health was seriously endangered by the pregnancy (71%); if the pregnancy resulted from rape (56%); if there was a strong chance of deformity in the baby (55%); if the family had a very low income and could not afford any more children (21%); if the woman was not married and did not want to marry the man (18%); and if the woman was married and did not want any more children (15%). The major conclusion was that there was support among the majority of Americans for legal abortion only for the three "hard" reasons--when the mother's health was threatened by the pregnancy, when the pregnancy resulted from rape, and when there was a distinct possibility of

deformity in the child. A strong positive association was found between educational attainment and favorable attitudes toward abortion (Rossi, 1966).
Using data from the 1965 National Fertility Study on some 5,600 currently-married women under the age of 55, Moore, Ryder, and Westoff (1969) conducted an analysis designed to assess the structure of American attitudes toward abortion. It was found that older women who have or hope they have completed childbearing hold more favorable attitudes toward abortion legalization than younger women. Jewish women were least opposed to abortion while Catholic women were most opposed. It was also found that, except among Catholics (where the relationship was inverse), education was directly related to favorable attitudes. Nonwhite women were consistently less favorable than white women in their attitudes toward abortion.
In 1969, Louis Harris conducted a national public opinion poll using 1,600 respondents. His conclusion with reference to abortion legalization was that the morality of the American population is becoming increasingly liberal. This liberal shift characterized those in the upper reaches of

achievement: professional men and women, the college-educated, the prosperous suburbanites. To these he added the young under 30 and the blacks (Harris, 1969).
Judith Blake, in a recent work on abortion attitudes, analyzed differences and changes in views on abortion among Americans during the 1960's. The data were drawn from five Gallup polls taken during the period 1962 through 1969 and from the 1965 National Fertility Study. Blake's conclusion was that abortion for "hard" reasons is supported most strongly by nonCatholics, males, and the well-educated (Blake, 1971).
With the exception of the Moore, Ryder, and Westoff analysis (1969), the aforementioned studies did not attempt a systematic multivariate analysis of the relationship between demographic variables and attitudes toward abortion. The present study attempts to correct this deficiency by assessing the relationship of nine demographic factors--age, city size, education, family income, occupation of the household head, race, religion, section of the country, and sex--to the answers to a question in a Fall, 1967, Gallup poll for the Population Council. The question focused on attitudes toward the legalization of abortion for four "hard" reasons:
As you know, a few states have recently enacted laws that make it legal for a woman to have an abortion if her health might be endangered, or if the child might be deformed, or in the case of rape or incest. On the whole do you approve of such laws or not?

MATERIAL AND METHODS
The 1967 Population Council poll did not use multivariate analysis--that is, examine the relationship of a given factor to the opinion question while holding constant other relevant factors--to assess whether a particular relationship was real or due to some other factor. Moreover, only religion and education of the nine demographic factors on which information was gathered were examined for their relationship to the opinion question (Kantner, 1968). The present analysis was concerned with the nine background factors on which information exists in the poll and the relationship of each to the opinion question. The relationship between each factor and the opinion question was assessed via multivariate analysis (Rosenberg, 1968) in conjunction with inferential and descriptive statistics. The inferential statistical test used was chisquare.
To evaluate the strength of a statistically significant relationship, Cramer's V was used.2 In tables where significance was established with chi-square but Cramer's V was below 0.10, the relationship was considered too weak to be of practical importance. Admittedly, a V of 0.10 is still relatively weak. However, a V of 0.10 helped divide significant tables containing no apparent response patterns from significant tables with recognizable response patterns. It also helped divide significant tables with small differences between categories of the independent variable from significant tables

The categories for response were "approve," "disapprove," "don't know," and "no answer,
1 In the sample as a whole, the distribution of responses was: Approve, 75%; Disapprove. 19%; Don't know and No answer, 6%. The present study, however, uses only the Approve and Disapprove categories.

-I = | iVMin(r --l,c --
where Min (r -- 1, c -- 1) refers to either the number of rows minus one or the number of columns minus one, whichever is smaller. V can attain a value of 1.00 even when the number of rows and columns in a table is unequal. A more detailed discussion of V may be found in Blalock (1960, p. 230).

RESULTS
Multivariate analysis indicated that age, family income, occupation of the household head, race, section of the country, and sex did not in themselves have an effect on attitudes toward the legalization of abortion for the four hard reasons. City size, education, and religion, however, appeared to have an effect.

the reliability of a poll's results, the questions in The Population Council poll were included in three successive surveys (or waves), each conducted three to four weeks apart. However, the results reported in this analysis were based on just two waves because the opinion question under study was not asked in one of the three waves.
The number of cases on which the results of the poll are based was the number of individuals interviewed inflated by a weighting procedure designed to increase the degree to which the sample is representative of the population.8 As a result

CITY SIZE
It was predicted that size of city would be directly related to the approval of abortion legalization, and a one-tailed chi-square test revealed that, in the sample as a whole, such a significant relationship existed, with V exceeding 0.10 (see Table 1). The hypothesized relationship was supported in the total sample except for a deviation by persons living in areas of 250,000-999,999 population.
Instituting controls for age, education, family income, occupation of the household head, race, religion, and section of the country generated twenty-eight tables; of these,

3 This is a "times-at-home" weighting and is used in place of callbacks. The basis for the weighting is that, in any survey using a single call, persons who are infrequently at home at the time of the interview are underrepresented in the sample while those often at home at the time of the interview are overrepresented. This bias is corrected by giving greater weight to those persons interviewed who are not frequently at home at the time of the interview. The weighting is accomplished by counting more than once the responses

significance was achieved in all but two. The tables in which significance was not achieved were for clerical and sales workers
of interviewees not often at home; the less frequently the interviewee is at home, the greater the number of times his or her responses are counted, although the responses of no interviewee are counted more than four times. This weighting procedure is in principle equivalent to using four calls in a survey.

and for southerners. In all of the significant tables, V was at least 0.10. The significant tables for the relationship between city size and attitudes exhibited the V values shown in Table 2. However, in none of these tables was the hypothesized relationship of a direct, unidirectional relationship between city size and approval found to exist. Scrutiny of the data revealed only one general pattern, namely, that approval of the legalization of abortion for the four hard reasons was higher for persons living in cities of at least one million inhabitants than for persons living in less-populated areas. This relationship held in all significant tables except for individuals, 30-39 years of age, persons whose family income was $5,000-$6,999, and residents of the Midwest.
The research hypothesis that approval of the legalization of abortion for the four hard reasons is directly related to city size was not accepted. However, the null hypothesis that city size bears no intrinsic relationship to attitudes toward abortion legalization was also not accepted, since one general pattern did emerge from the data. This pattern was that persons living in cities of over a million inhabitants tend to be more likely to approve of the legalization of abortion than people living in areas of lesser population.
EDUCATION
It was predicted that educational level would be directly related to approval of

abortion legalization for the four hard reasons. A one-tailed chi-square test revealed a significant relationship in the total sample, and V was over 0.10 (see Table 3).

Except for the fact that no differences existed between high-school graduates and persons with some college, the research hypothesis was supported.
Controls instituted for age, city size, family income, occupation of the household head, race, religion, section of the country, and sex generated thirty-three tables of which twenty-eight were significant. Significance was not established in tables for persons 60-69 years of age, residents of cities with a population of 1,000,000 and over, persons with a family income of $5,000-$6,999, residents of households whose head was a clerical or sales worker, and Negroes. Of the twenty-eight significant tables, only three were not characterized by a V of 0.10 or higher; these were the tables for members of households whose head was a professional or business executive, for members of households whose head was a skilled worker, and for Catholics. The twenty-eight significant tables for the relationship between educational level and attitudes exhibited the V values shown in Table 4.
Of the twenty-five tables for which significance was established and for which V was 0.10 or higher, only four tables clearly supported the research hypothesis that approval of the legalization of abortion for the four hard reasons increases unidirectionally with educational attainment. The four tables were for members of households whose head was a farmer or farm laborer,

Protestants, Caucasians, and females. Only in these four tables was approval found to be directly related to education.
In addition, it was found that an increase in education tends to be associated-- though not in a consistent unidirectional fashion--with increased approval in several other tables. In these tables, a direct relationship did not exist between educational level and approval; however, higher educational levels tended to be characterized by higher approval rates and lower educational levels by lower approval rates. These tables were for: persons under 50 or 70-fyears of age; residents of areas of 10,00049,999 population and 250,000-999,999 population; persons with a family income under $3,000 and at least $10,000; members of households whose head was a professional or business executive (among whom V = 0.09); residents of the East and Midwest; and males.
Based on the findings from the multivariate analysis, it was concluded that the research hypothesis could not be accepted. However, the null hypothesis that education bears no relationship to attitudes toward abortion legalization was also not accepted. It was concluded that an increase in education is associated--though not necessarily in a consistently unidirectional fashion--with increased approval for the types of persons previously specified. It is of significance that the upper-middle class appears among these categories.
RELIGION
A one-tailed chi-square test revealed that there was a significant relationship in the total sample religion and attitudes when religion was trichotomized into ProtestantCatholic-Jewish; the data appear in Table 5, and V can be seen to exceed 0.10. Virtually all Jews approved of abortion legalization; Protestants were less likely to approve; and Catholics--with a 67% ap-

proval rate--were the least likely to approve. Protestant-Catholic differences exhibited a chi-square value of 158.2, which was significant at the 0.0005 level, and a V of 0.17. Thus, there was a significant relationship between religion and attitudes when religion was dichotomized into Protestant-Catholic as well as when it was trichotomized into Protestant-Catholic-Jewish, and in both instances V exceeded 0.10.

It had been hypothesized that approval of the legalization of abortion for the four hard reasons would be higher among Protestants than Catholics and that Jews would be more likely to approve of the legalization of abortion than either Protestants or Catholics. Table 5 leads support to this hypothesis for the sample as a whole. Unfortunately, upon the institution of controls, Jews had to be dropped from the analysis due to their small frequency in the sample.
The research hypothesis then was that approval of the legalization of abortion for the four hard reasons would be higher among Protestants than Catholics. Under controls for age, city size, education, family income, occupation of the household head, race, and section of the country, thirtyfour tables were created. Significance was achieved in all tables except three: for persons living in cities of 10,000-49,999 population, those in families with an income under $3,000, and Negroes. In the thirtyone significant tables, V was 0.10 or larger

in all but two: for those whose educational category was "High-school incomplete" and for members of households whose head was an unskilled worker. In the remaining twenty-nine significant tables, it was found that Protestants exhibited a higher rate of approval than did Catholics. The values of V in the thirty-one significant tables for the relationship between religious affiliation and attitudes are shown in Table 6.
An interesting finding was that as educational level, income, and occupational prestige increased, the relationship between religion and attitudes toward abortion legalization tended to grow stronger, although the relationship between religion and attitudes was stronger for farmers and farm laborers than for any urban occupational category. It was also found that the Protestant-Catholic differences were not significant when family income was under $3,000 and that they were of no practical consequence among persons in households whose head was an unskilled worker. This suggests that no important difference exists between Protestants and Catholics in the lower class.
SUMMARY
By way of summary, a multivariate analysis indicated that age, family income, occupation of the household head, race, section of the country, and sex did not have any general effect on attitudes toward the legalization of abortion for the four hard reasons. In terms of population of the area of residence, persons living in cities of at least a million inhabitants were more likely to approve of abortion legalization than persons in less populated areas. With regard to the variable of education, an increase in educational attainment was associated-- though not necessarily in a consistently unidirectional fashion--with an increased approval of abortion legalization, particularly in the upper-middle class. With regard

to religion, Protestants were consistently more likely than Catholics to favor abortion legalization except in the lower class and among Negroes (where ProtestantCatholic differences did not exist), and as education, income, and occupational prestige (for urban occupations) increased, the relationship between religion and attitudes tended to become stronger.

Perhaps the most theoretically significant outcome of the present study is that six of the nine demographic variables did not have an influence on attitudes and that the three which did have an influence did not have a strong impact given the fact V rarely reached even 0.30. This suggests that demographic variables possess only a fraction of the predictive-explanatory power for attitudes toward abortion which has been imputed to these variables by past

research and that a theory to explain and predict abortion attitudes will not attain closure until other types of factors, probably including social-psychological variables, are considered.
