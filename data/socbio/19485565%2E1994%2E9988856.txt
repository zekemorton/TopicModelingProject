ABSTRACT: Black adolescents in the United States consistently report an earlier age of first intercourse than White adolescents. Purely psychosocial explanations of this finding have been less than successful. We propose an "epidemic" model that combines social contagion (a psychosocial process) and pubertal maturation (a biological process). This epidemic model permits social contacts among adolescents of the same age and also among younger and older adolescents. The model statistically fit the actual growth curve of sexuality well for Whites; its fit was not as good for Blacks. From computer simulation analyses, we concluded that pubertal maturation may be more important in accounting for the racial difference in the onset of sexual intercourse than previously thought.

Race differences in rates of sexual behavior have been reported in most American studies of African American and Caucasian adolescents. Black adolescents usually report an earlier onset of sexual behavior than White adolescents. Understanding the origin of this racial difference is important for public policies aimed at reducing the negative consequences of precocious sexuality, including the spread of sexually transmitted diseases (especially AIDS) and the attenuation of life-time opportunities because of child care responsibilities (Hayes, 1987).
Many psychological variables that explain variation in sexual intercourse onset within racial groups become much weaker, however, as explanations of racial differences. For example, earlier onset of sexual intercourse usually occurs in lower social classes. Nevertheless, in two independent studies of representative data sets, statisti-

cal controls for indices of social class (education, income) failed to reduce race differences in the onset of intercourse (Furstenberg et al., 1987; Weinberg and Williams, 1988). Moreover, Furstenberg et al. (1987), using the National Survey of Children, explored other variables prominent in theories of adolescent sexuality. They calculated the log-odds of sexual intercourse as 3.7:1 in favor of Black adolescents, and then recalculated them after introducing various control variables. Variables measuring parents' work status, father's presence or absence, school performance, educational aspirations, and role expectations for parenthood all failed to reduce the log-odds favoring Black adolescents. The sole variable resulting in a log-odds reduction (from 3.7 to 1.8) was the respondents' report of friends' sexual intercourse. This peer measure, however, is but a restatement of the situation that we

seek to explain: the greater prevalence of intercourse among Black peers than White peers.
As ordinary psychological and social variables may fail as explanatory mechanisms, we believe that some other influence must contribute to this racial difference. For instance, Washington (1982) suggested that this missing explanatory influence was a persistence of African heritage and a "sex positive" culture among Blacks. The existence of different social norms, however, may beg the question as to why such cultural norms persist.
Instead, we propose differences in the timing of pubertal maturation in Black and White adolescent females as an explanation of their racial difference (Harlan et al., 1980; National Heart, Lung, Blood Institute, Growth and Health Study Research Group, 1992). Pubertal maturation has the desirable property that helps explain variation in sexual behavior within both Black and White populations (Bingham et al., 1990; Buck and Stavraky, 1967; Cutler et al., 1979; Flannery et al., 1991; Udry, 1979, 1988; Zabin et al., 1986).
The work of Udry and his colleagues indicates that pubertal development has a direct effect on sexual interest and behavior, independent of social reactions to changes in physical appearance (Udry et al., 1985; Udry et al., 1986). Nonetheless, pubertal timing has not been a major contender in previous explanations of racial differences. Furstenberg et al (1987, p. 512) criticized it on the grounds that nearly all girls reached pubertal maturity by age 15 and on the grounds that some Black males reported pre-pubertal sex-

ual intercourse. The Panel on Adolescent Pregnancy and Child Rearing noted the tendency of Black girls to be more mature than white girls, but they decided that the differences in physical maturity were too small to explain the race difference (Hayes, 1987, p. 97).
We believe that the possible impact of female maturation timing has not been appreciated because researchers have thought in terms of linear effects only. Linear regression models consider the maturation status of the individual, but not that of the group in which he or she is embedded. We propose an "epidemic" modeling approach that views sexuality in the context of a social contagion process. In our "epidemic" models, individual risk is highly influenced by group characteristics. In particular, our models are designed to fit prevalence data across time, in which the prevalences reflect the number or percentage of members of some group who have ever performed a certain behavior. When such behaviors are at least partially under social influence, then we expect social contacts within the network to "spread" the behavior.
These models are in a sense simulations of the interaction process that helps such behaviors to spread. There are two basic types of contacts simulated by our models that can lead to spreading the behavior of interest: epidemic and nonepidemic contacts. Epidemic contacts occur when someone who has already performed the behavior comes in contact with someone who has not; with some probability, the "carrier" will influence the "susceptible" to perform the behavior. Nonepidemic contacts occur when two "sus-

ceptibles" come in contact with one another; with some different probability, they may perform the behavior together spontaneously. Thus, to call these "epidemic models" only reflects their epidemiological origin. In fact, they model both epidemic and nonepidemic spread of relevant behaviors with equal facility.
We refer to this general class of models as "epidemic models of the onset of social activities" (EMOSA models, Rowe, Gulley, and Rodgers, 1992; Rowe et al., 1992; Rowe and Rodgers, 1991a, 19916; Rowe, Rodgers, and Meseck-Bushey, 1989). The mathematical structures that underlie the EMOSA modeling approach itself are anything but new. The application of the modeling approach to adolescent transition behaviors is the "innovation." Such models have been used for a long time by epidemiologists interested in the spread of biological organisms--viruses, for examplethrough a social community, by sociologists interested in the diffusion of innovations (Hamblin et al., 1973), and by biologists interested in modeling cultural transmission in addition to genetic transmission (Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman, 1981). Many social behaviors are under the control of social contagion processes, and they can be readily modeled with appropriate mathematical formulations. In a sense, many adolescent transition behaviors (e.g., smoking, sexual behavior, or even playing in the band) are rediscovered by each cohort, as new social "innovations" to be spread through the adolescent social network.
We use some terms taken directly from epidemiological models (e.g.,

"contagion," "carriers," "susceptibles") that are helpful because they give an intuitive understanding of the models. We note that our models are mute with respect to issues of morality; nor do we imply that any type of biological epidemic is involved in the social contagion process.
The EMOSA sexuality models (which have only been defined for voluntary heterosexual behavior) specify a two-state mixing population of males and females in which cross-sex individuals meet randomly and in which nonvirgins are the potential "carriers" of sexual intercourse. The rate of spread of sexual intercourse depends strongly on the number of nonvirgins in the population at any time. The model also accounts for noncontagious spread as well, which occurs when two virgins become nonvirgins together. A critical feature of the model is the ability to introduce filters, that are like "covariates" in ordinary regression models. The filters can be used to specify certain restrictions on the mixing population. For example, an important filter will be introduced in which only pubertally mature females are eligible to become nonvirgins.
In a randomly mixing population, with proportions Pm of male nonvirgins and P/of female nonvirgins, the probabilities of two opposite-sex individuals randomly encountering one another are Pm(l-Pf), Pf(l-Pm), and (1--Pm) (1--Pf), for an encounter between nonvirgin males and virgin females, nonvirgin females and virgin males, and virgin males and virgin females, respectively. Because our model assumes that only pubertally mature females will initiate sexual

of a high degree of "mixing" in adolescent populations is reasonable.
We conducted a simulation analysis to evaluate the importance of the random mixing assumption (Rowe et al.,

1989). In these analyses, we assumed that social contacts were correlated so that nonvirgins were more likely to encounter one another than they would have by chance encounters. Over a wide range of correlations, changes in parameter values were small. Hence, we concluded that the model was relatively robust to departures from the random assortment assumption.
Another assumption of our earlier model was that an adolescent's first sexual partner was exactly his or her own age. In fact, we know that both males and females tend to have as their first partner an individual older than themselves (Zelnik and Shah, 1983). In analysis of the ADSEX data set, we found that few first partners were younger than the respondent (7.5 per cent). Most were either the same age, one year older, or two years older (73 per cent). Our original model as presented in Equation 1 and 2 has been modified to take such inter-cohort contacts into account.
This paper reports an inter-cohort contagion model that accounts for mter-cohort contacts of both epidemic and nonepidemic types. We used the empirical data to decide on a threeyear window of mixing populations. Each adolescent is eligible to contact others of the same age, one year older, or two years older. The mathematical statement of the earlier EMOSA sexuality model from Rowe et al. (1989) has been re-written to account for these additional types of contacts.
Table 1 presents the mathematical terms defining the number of added nonvirgins for a particular age, "a," in a given year. Note that we have changed the model from a prevalence model (as defined in our first EMOSA

sexuality model) to a yearly gain model. This change facilitates statistical tests of the fit of the model, to be described shortly. In Table 1, there are a total of six terms per sex divided between those terms representing the contact of virgins with same-age or older nonvirgins and those representing virgin-virgin contacts.
The between-cohort contacts were weighted according to the empirical likelihood of their occurrence. The best empirical information on this likelihood that we could find was contained in the ADSEX data (the data referred to previously reflecting adolescent interactions in an approximately intact social environment; see Rowe et al., 1989, for a more complete description of the ADSEX data). Of the 73 per cent of the ADSEX respondents whose first partner was 0-2 years older, 44.5 per cent were within-cohort contacts, 31 per cent were contacts with the next older cohort, and 24.5 per cent were contacts with the cohort two years older. Contacts with younger partners and with partners more than two years older were not represented within the model. The inter-cohort contagion model is more realistic than our earlier model (which only accounted for within-cohort contacts); but obviously it becomes mathematically untractable if more than a very few cross-age contacts are permitted within the model.
In our earlier EMOSA sexuality model, which was fit first to the ADSEX prevalences, we found that the model fit better when Whites and Blacks were treated as separately interacting populations. Further, when the model was fit separately to the two races, the social contact parameters

bly nonlinear). These extrapolations are also included in Table 2. In our earlier study fitting the ADSEX data (Rowe et al., 1989), maturity prevalences were available for White females directly from this local sample. Those data support the extrapolated values in Table 2. Proportions mature in that study were zero per cent (N = 39) at age 10 and 10.4 per cent (TV = 48) at age 11, versus the extrapolated values of 1 per cent, respectively. In later analyses, several values for racial differences in pubertal timing are examined to explore the sensitivity of our results to the particular values that we have estimated.
INTER-COHORT CONTAGION MODEL
FITTING PROCEDURE
The equations defining our model were estimated iteratively. A program subroutine MIX first computed the number of new nonvirgins in a given year. A subroutine AGE then aged each cohort one year, adding the number of new nonvirgins to the number of preexisting nonvirgins in each cohort. Then a new youngest cohort was added. In our data, this youngest cohort was 10 years old. The proportion of nonvirgins in the youngest cohort was set equal to the proportion observed in the data. In fourteen iterations, the model-generated proportions reached an equilibrium state (for given values of Tnm, Tnp and k) and did not change appreciably with the addition of new cohorts.
Trial values of Tnm, Tnp and k were improved by maximizing a log likelihood function (L) based on the proportion making transition between any two ages (Hoel et al., 1971). That is,

(3) L = N(poa+1-poa) log(pea+1-pea)
where TV was the sample size, po was the observed cumulative proportion at age "a + 1" and "a," and pe was the model predicted cumulative proportions at age "a + 1" and age "a." Summation was over the total number of ages. The tail, 1 -- proportion at the oldest age, was also included in evaluating the likelihood.
Because likelihood ratio tests of statistical significance are very sensitive to sample size, they generally indicate lack of fit of a model in any large dataset. We use two different fit statistics to respond to weaknesses in the likelihood ratio tests. First, the "rate r2" is a goodness-of-fit measure that is less dependent on sample size (Pitcher and Hamblin, 1982). This statistic is computed as the correlation between the proportion predicted to become nonvirgin between each pair of ages and the proportion observed to do so (TV = number of ages -- 1). Because it is a correlation-based measure, the size of the rate-r2 is also easily interpreted. A second statistic we will use is a goodness-of-fit index that is becoming increasingly popular: the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC: e.g., Sclove, 1987; Bozdogan, 1987). The AIC is a function of the log likelihood that our fitting routine optimizes, adjusted by the number of free parameters in the model: AIC = - 2 L + 2k, where L is defined above and k is the number of independent parameters to be estimated in the model. The AIC has the particular attraction that it can be used to compare models that have been fit to the same data with equal degrees of freedom, a type of test not

RESULTS
We present two types of analyses in this section, a preliminary "traditional analysis," and a much more complete EMOSA analysis. The preliminary analysis attempts to explain the race difference in adolescent sexual behavior with linear models and traditional psychosocial variables. The EMOSA analysis uses the inter-cohort contagion model to simulate the social interaction of adolescents, along with a maturational filter for females that provides a biological constraint on the mixing process.
TRADITIONAL ANALYSIS
The first line of Table 3 presents the correlation of race with age of first intercourse (AFI). Then several partial correlations are presented in which one psychosocial variable was partialed out of the race-AFI relationship. If the race-AFI correlation is partially caused by the relationship of each to the psychosocial variables, we would expect the partial correlations to be substantially less than the original.
Race had a greater impact on sexual intercourse initiation in males (r =

0.36) than in females (r = 0.14), given the dummy coding (White = 1, Black = 0). These associations showed an earlier onset in Blacks than Whites. All correlations were statistically significant, although the samples sizes are so large that they were not necessarily meaningful substantively.
None of the psychosocial control variables appreciably reduced the racial effect in males (partial rs 0.340.38, compared to the original of 0.36). In females, controlling for parental education reduced the partial correlation from 0.14 to 0.11. The religiosity variable actually worked in the wrong direction and increased the racial difference.
In summary, in both sexes, most of the racial difference remains unaccounted for after adjusting for the covariates. If we drew conclusions from this type of modeling, we would report that the race difference is largely unexplained, and that the particular psychosocial variables we investigated-- variables selected because they would appear on theoretical grounds to be strong contenders to explain the race difference--are not potent explanatory variables. Of course, a much more careful and in-depth linear model analysis of these relationships could be run, further replicating and extending

work described in the literature review above. However, we instead apply the EMOSA approach, which is substantively interpretable as simulating a plausible social process, and which simultaneously accounts for both psychosocial and biological processes.
FITTING THE INTER-COHORT
CONTAGION MODEL
We fit our inter-cohort contagion model to the proportions of nonvirgins ages 10-18 years. We first fit our model not permitting social contacts between age cohorts. These fits resulted in log likelihood values of --13,305 and -6,284 for Whites and Blacks, respectively. We then fit our model allowing social contacts with the cohorts zero, one, and two years older. The log likelihoods were larger, indicating the better fit of our inter-cohort model (L = -13,240, and -6,235 for Whites and Blacks, respectively). Since the two same race models have equal degrees of freedom, we computed Akaike Information Criterion indices for each and selected the model with the smaller AIC. In each case, the inter-cohort contagion model fit the data better than the simpler intracohort interaction model.
Tables 4 and 5 present the expected and observed distributions and the parameter estimates for Whites and Blacks, respectively. The model fit both race subgroups (rate r2 = 0.931 for Whites, rate r2 = 0.721 for Blacks). The lower fit values for Blacks was primarily caused by the model overpredicting the proportion of nonvirgin females at young ages (e.g., 10.3 per cent predicted versus 3 per cent observed at age 13). Evidence from validity studies exists (e.g., Rodgers, Billy, and Udry,

The most important substantive result of this paper is the comparison of Black and White parameter values. If the contact parameters were very different, this result would suggest that the psychosocial processes involving social contacts and the spread of sexual behavior are different in the two races. If they were similar, this result would replicate the previous finding in the

ADSEX data and would suggest, again, that when maturation differences between Black and White females are accounted for, most racial difference in sexual behavior disappears.
The parameter values obtained by fitting the inter-cohort contagion model to the NLSY data are given in Tables 4 and 5. The values were surprisingly similar across the two races. Black female nonvirgins had a slightly higher contact rate than White female nonvirgins (Tnf = 0.66 versus 0.62); White male nonvirgins had a slightly higher contact rate than Black male nonvirgins (Tnm = 0.40 versus 0.34); and Black virgins had a slightly higher contact rate than White virgins (k =

0.041 versus 0.037). The equivalent parameter estimates from Rowe et al. (1989), using a different dataset and a simpler model, were Tnf = 0.90 for Whites and Tnf = 0.78 for Blacks, Tnm = 0.22 for Whites and Tnm = 0.31 for Blacks, and k = 0.10 for Whites and 0.14 for Blacks. Thus, not only are the parameter estimates stable across the races within each study, but the pattern of contact parameters are consistent across two different datasets with two different versions of the EMOSA sexuality model.
SENSITIVITY ANALYSES
In any model-fitting exercise like the one we report here, there may be pieces of the mathematical structure of the model that are particularly "volatile." For example, if the model is highly dependent on the quality of the maturation estimates at ages 10 and 11, then substituting extrapolated values instead of using actual data for these estimates would be problematic. If, on the other hand, the model results are quite stable across a whole range of possible values for these estimates, we would have much less concern over using the extrapolated values.
We will present two types of sensitivity analyses. The first is an inspection of the sensitivity of the model to exactly the example above, that is, changing values in the age 10 and 11 maturation estimates. The second is a comparison of the importance of the contact rate parameters (the psychosocial part of the model) with the maturation filters (the biological part of the model).
The use of linear extrapolation may have overestimated the racial differ-

ence in maturation timing at ages 10 and 11 years. At age ten, the problem was especially acute, because the linear extrapolation predicted fewer than zero per cent mature for Whites, and we reset the value to 1 per cent. We tried new values of 20 per cent Black females and 5 per cent White females, and new values of 15 per cent Black females and 10 per cent White females. The statistical fits changed only slightly with the new maturation estimates; fits for Blacks improved, and fits for Whites showed no trend. The races' parameter values were closest when the original Black's 24.9 per cent and White's 1 per cent maturation values were used. In percentage terms, the largest change occurred in the virgin contact rate, "k," where the Black rate increased and the White rate decreased (in the 20%/5% run, k = 0.044 Blacks and 0.034 Whites; in the 15%/10% run, k = 0.048 Blacks and 0.032 Whites). Those results are even closer to being consistent with those obtained using the earlier ADSEX data.
MATURATION COMPARED WITH
CONTACT RATES
These results suggest that a physical process--maturation timing--may be more important for explaining race differences than the rate parameters in the social contagion process. An explicit comparison of the effects of maturation timing and contagion rates can be made by using the model to make predictions. In the actual data, considerable racial difference already exists at age 10 years: for example, 6.5 times more Black than White 10-year-old males reported nonvirginity (7.2 per cent vs. 1.1 per cent). To avoid this

unexplained heterogeneity, we ran the model starting with zero per cent nonvirgin 10-year-old males and females.
Four types of models were run: (1) White contact parameters, White maturation values, (2) White contact parameters, Black maturation values, (3) Black contact parameters, White maturation values, and (4) Black contact parameters, Black maturation values. Models with the same maturation rates (e.g., 1 and 3) were compared to models with the same contact parameters (e.g., 1 and 2). If maturation timing has the greater effect, rate r2's for models with the same maturation timing (but different contact parameters) should be greater than rate r2's for models with the same contact parameters (but different maturation timing).
Table 6 presents comparisons of "same contact parameter" models versus "same maturation" models using different assumptions about pubertal maturity at age 10 years. Different contact parameter values (but the same maturation timing) had the least impact on model predictions. Indeed, in 5 out of 6 comparisons, the solutions under White versus Black contact parameter values were essentially identical (rate r2> =0.98). Changing the maturation assumptions had the greater impact on the solutions. The rate r2's explained from 4 per cent to 8 per cent less variance when maturation was changed than when the contact parameters were changed, and the rate r2 between solutions ranged from 0.91 to 0.93. These results indicate that observed racial differences could arise more easily from different maturation timetables than from differences in effective contact rates.

To illustrate the strong potential for purely maturational differences to influence the timing of sexual intercourse, Table 7 compares a model run using equal contact parameter values (TV =0.641, Tnm = 0.371, and k = 0.039) and using either White or Black maturational data. This model further assumed that 10-year-old children of either race were virgins. The effect of the maturational difference was to produce ratios of nonvirgins favoring Blacks from 4.6 to 1 to 1.2 to 1. Even holding all assumed social process equal across Whites and Blacks, we find that pubertal maturation timing can potentially produce large racial differences in adolescent nonvirginity.
DISCUSSION
The prevalence of nonvirginity increases rapidly in early adolescence, but more rapidly for African American than Caucasian adolescents. Many psychosocial variables postulated to explain the onset of sexuality within Black or White groups fail to account for this mean racial difference. Using a nationally representative sample, we found that three psychosocial variables (self-esteem, religiosity, and social

class) could not explain this racial difference. Thus, we chose to focus on maturational differences between Black and White adolescents with Black girls maturing earlier than White girls. It was hypothesized that maturation could account for a large part of the racial difference if it was included as a parameter in a statistical "intercohort contagion" model of the prevalence of sexual intercourse.
Fitting this inter-cohort contagion model to nonvirginity prevalences supported the hypothesis. The contact parameters, Tnm and Tnf, reflected the rate of "spread" of sexual intercourse from nonvirgins to virgins; and k reflected the rate among virgins. If social norms and cultural factors mainly accounted for the race difference, we would expect that these parameters would be larger in Blacks than in Whites; they were not. On the other hand, the maturational timing differences had a greater impact on nonvirginity distributions than did reasonable differences in these parameter estimates. Data were generated from one set of parameter values using different Black and White maturational timing data. This comparison showed that racial differences in maturational timing

alone can produce large racial differences in rates of nonvirginity.
Further, the basic structure of the contact parameters was very similar to that obtained in Rowe et al's (1989) analysis of the ADSEX data. The effective contact rate of females was relatively high, suggesting the relative ease with which female nonvirgins can convert male virgins. The male effective contact rate was lower, and nonepidemic contact rates were fairly small.
Our inter-cohort contagion model certainly cannot account for all aspects of the data. Overall fit for Whites was somewhat better than for Blacks and over-predicted the number of nonvirgin Black females. For males, race ratios in the observed data were larger than those estimated from our gener-

ated data in Table 7. The failure of the model to fit Black Americans as well as White Americans may reside more in the data than in the model. Black Americans' reports of sexuality and deviant behavior tend to be less reliable than White Americans' (Hindelang et al., 1981; Mensch and Kandel, 1988; Rodgers, Billy, and Udry, 1982). Falsely claiming intercourse among males or falsely claiming nonintercourse among females could produce the patterns of deviations from the model seen here.
Further efforts to develop social contagion models of the onset of intercourse should progress on two fronts. First, reliable data are needed on sexuality from representative samples of adolescents, including data on physical development and hormones. Second, further steps must be taken to bring the social contagion model closer to reality. Through either equation or computer simulation approaches, we need to include explicitly in our models some of the psychosocial variables affecting adolescent sexuality (such as parental education; see Billy et al., 1988).
There are many other possible applications of our EMOSA social contagion models. In other research, the EMOSA models have been applied to smoking and drinking (Rowe, Chassin, Presson, Edwards, and Sherman, 1992; Rowe and Rodgers, 1991a). The smoking model introduced a sequence of stages absent in the sexual behavior model; namely, transitions were defined among four statuses--nonsmoker, experimental smoker, regular smoker, and ex-smoker. The first transition, from nonsmoker to experimental smoker, involved a social contagion

16

process, whereas the remaining transitions did not. The sexual behavior model could be extended in the same direction by adding a transition from infrequently sexually active--as is the case for most young adolescents--to frequently sexually active. For females, transitions could be added representing pregnancy and childbirth. Our models also may describe how AIDS spreads heterosexually into younger populations depending on the degree of cross-cohort mixing as modelled here. Thus, further work could extend our EMOSA models to the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS. Social contagion processes also may apply to behaviors such as marriages, which are not ordinarily thought of in this way.
More broadly, social contagion models fit into work on cultural evolution and coevolution (Boyd and Richerson, 1985; Cavalli-Sforza and Feldman, 1981). Although we applied our model here to a specific behaviorsexual intercourse--social contagion processes also may be used to explain the spread of cultural knowledge among adolescents. In our application, we would want to model the increase in the adolescent population of accurate knowledge about sexuality and of social beliefs regarding sexuality. In Dawkin's (1992) terms, the prevalence of "memes," the unit of replication of cultural transmission, must be understood. An advantage to studying cultural transmission among adolescents is that generation times would be relatively short. Ignorant 9-year-olds become knowledgeable 16-year-olds in just seven years. In contrast, new cultural innovations and other "memes"

may take generations to reach an equilibrium in human populations, or reach their equilibrium just once, making them inaccessible to empirical research. Thus, by focusing on adolescence, models of cultural transmission can be given a practical empirical test in a way impossible for many other cultural "memes." Such testing would help to select among the many competing ideas about cultural transmission, ideas which have received elegant mathematical formulations but little empirical testing in the theories of cultural transmission.
We have not addressed here the possible social policy implications of our modeling approach. Many psychosocial accounts of racial differences in sexuality rely on "weaknesses" in the Black community--for example, on "single parent families" and "poverty." Our explanation for the race difference casts the Black community in a more value-free light; after all, the mother of a mature 11-year-old, regardless of race, is more concerned about her daughter's sexuality than the mother of an immature 11-year-old daughter. Thus, this biological explanation is in a sense "race free," relying as it does on a maturational mechanism that just happens to covary with race. This approach also could have implications for the design of social interventions, if they paid attention to the dynamics of sexual intercourse in the early teenage years as a means of delaying the onset of the "social contagion" of sexuality. We do not address social policy implications here, however, because our goal was only to define a causal description of the spread of adolescent sexual behavior.

In conclusion, we donot claim that maturational timing differences are the only cause of race differences in adolescent sexuality. Such aview would be taking a model too literally. However, we believe that the importance of pubertal maturation has been substantially underestimated. Psychosocial explanations may have been overestimated, but this possibility isdifficult to assess when a variable as apparently important as maturation has beenexcluded from previous analyses. In fact, psychosocial variables may have much less variance to account for (and may potentially do so more successfully)

once models that include a maturational component anda plausibledynamic description have been further developed. "Epidemic" modeling of the onset of adolescent behavior provides one such modeling paradigm.
