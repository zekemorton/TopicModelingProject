ABSTRACT: Data from parish registers on 182 couples married between 1754 and 1772 in Lancashire, England, were used to compare lifetime reproductive success of farmers and craftsmen. Farmers were expected to be of higher average status and wealth than craftsmen; thus, these data were used to test the hypothesis that status and reproductive success were positively correlated in this society. Fanners raised a significantly higher mean number of children to age 21 than did craftsmen, although mean numbers of children bom to farmers and craftsmen were not significantly different. The proportion of children surviving to age 21 was significantly higher for fanners than for craftsmen.

Some authors have argued that behavioral adaptations enabling the individual to obtain or control resources have been important in human evolution (e.g., Barash, 1979; Wilson, 1978). If so, one would predict that for most of human evolutionary history, the quality of resources controlled must have been correlated with reproductive success. However, it is often stated that there is no correlation between wealth and reproductive success in "advanced" societies (e.g., MacDonald, 1983). Indeed, quite a few studies have found a negative relationship between social class and fertility in twentieth-century industrial society (e.g., Wrong, 1958). On the other hand, Irons (1979) shows a correlation between number of children born and wealth in a present-day polygynous society. Also, historical studies have suggested that mean numbers of children born in families of high social class were higher than mean numbers of children born in families of low social class in certain monogamous societies in the past. Razi (1980) provides such data for

medieval England, while Smith (1977) presents similar data for Tokugawa, Japan, although in neither case were the data analyzed statistically. Similar results have been reported for some modern agrarian societies (e.g., Davis, 1951).
Because humans are long-lived organisms with a long period of immaturity, the number of children born to an individual or a couple is not a good estimate of reproductive success when childhood mortality is substantial. A truer measure of reproductive success is the number of children raised to maturity. Short-term ethnographic studies or cross-sectional studies of vital records cannot provide data on number of children raised to maturity, but historical records can. In this paper, I present a preliminary analysis of the relationship between occupational class, which is assumed to be roughly correlated with economic wellbeing, and reproductive success in an historical society, eighteenth-century Lancashire, England.

the usefulness of English parish records as tools in historical demography. Usually, these records are used to answer questions posed at the population level (e.g., questions about rates of birth or mortality). These records can also be used to follow the reproductive careers of individuals or married couples. As a result of Lord Hardwicke's Act of 1754, which promulgated a standard format for the recording of marriages, many parish records after that date record the groom's occupation. Occupations are sometimes also listed in records of burials. Comparison of marriage and burial records for the same individuals suggests that there was little opportunity for change in occupational class in English rural society in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. Thus, parish records provide evidence on differences between occupational classes with respect to reproductive parameters.
In this paper, I compare two broad occupational classes with respect to a number of variables relating to reproductive strategy and reproductive success. These occupational classes are (1) farmers, listed on the registers as "husbandman" or "yeoman"; and (2) craftsmen, including skilled trades such as weaver, tailor, cobbler, carpenter, etc. By far the majority of married couples whose reproductive careers I was able to trace belonged to either of these two classes. Individuals of lower class, listed in the registers as "laborers," accounted for relatively few recorded marriages; frequently, even when marriages of laborers were recorded, the individual soon disappeared from the records. These observations are consistent with a pattern of infrequent church marriage (cf. Newman, 1980) and high geographical mobility (cf. Maltby, 1971) in the laborer class. Marriages of gentry were

also infrequently found in the registers, apparently because gentry constituted a small portion of the population.
In peasant societies throughout the world, farmers are generally considered to be of higher status and prosperity than the craftsmen serving them (who may have smaller landholdings) (see, for example, Jay, 1969; Mayer, 1966; Rees, 1950). Gregory King in 1690 ranked farmers above craftsmen in status and income in England at that time (Laslett, 1971). In the mid-twentieth century, Williams (1956), in a study of an English country village, likewise ranked farmers above craftsmen in status. Thus, I predicted that farmers would have greater reproductive success on the average than craftsmen and used data from Lancashire parish records to test this prediction.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data were obtained from the registers for eight Lancashire parishes (Brierley, 1911, 1912; Cheetham and Sparke, 1934; Chippindall, 1931, 1932, 1933; Clayton, 1910; Farrer, 1911). In these registers, the occupation of the groom was consistently recorded for marriages from 1754 on. I examined all marriages recorded for the years 175472 in which the groom was not a widower and for which the groom's occupation was recorded. Baptisms of children and deaths of family members were then traced. I included in my data sample only families for which there was strong evidence of the family's remaining in the parish at least as long as the twenty-first anniversary of the baptism of the youngest child. Such evidence involved unambiguous mention of the parents (e.g., at their burials, because of their serving as churchwardens or baptismal sponsors,

mean number of children born to craftsman couples, but the difference was not significant. The mean number of children surviving to age 21was significantly higher for farmer couples than for craftsman couples. Likewise, the proportion of children surviving to age 21 was significantly higher for farmer couples than for craftsman couples. Mean childbearing span was slightly higher for farmer couples than for craftsman couples, but the difference was not significant.
All of the variables considered in Table 1 were intercorrelated and, as suggested by the data here, related to occupational class. I used partial correlation to assess independent effects on both the number of children surviving to age 21and the proportion of children surviving to age 21, of each of the following predictor variables: number of children born, childbearing span, and occupational class (scored as a dummy variable, 0 = craftsman, 1 = farmer). Table 2 shows second-order partials between each of these predictor variables and both number of children surviving to age 21 and proportion of children surviving to age 21,simultaneously controlling for

the other two predictor variables. All three predictor variables were found to have significant independent correlation with the number of children surviving to age 21. Not surprisingly, there was a strong positive partial correlation between the number of children born and the number of children surviving to age 21. Childbearing span and occupational class both showed more modest but significant positive partial correlation with the number of children surviving to age 21.There were small but significant positive partial correlations between the proportion of children surviving to age 21 and both childbearing span and occupational class.
For the 51 couples for which both husband's and wife's age at marriage were known, I calculated the age difference between husbands and wifes. The mean age difference was 7.81 yrs (S.D. = 11.37) for farmers and 1.95 yrs (S.D. = 6.85) for craftsmen. The variance in age difference for farmers was significantly higher than that for craftsmen (P<0.05). Thus, I tested for equality of means by Welch's approximate Mest. Mean age difference between groom and bride was found by

Thus, occupations which are considered to have high status in these societies do not always confer increased individual fitness. Mitchell and Pratto (1977) note that high-status occupations in the contemporary United States involve a "career life style" that deemphasizes the value of a family. The result is reduced individual fitness. It is possible that such a reduction in individual fitness is compensated by an increase in inclusive fitness (Hamilton, 1964), if high-status individuals with low personal reproductive success use their accumulated wealth to enhance the reproductive success of relatives (either during life or through bequests).
As noted by Arnold et al. (1976), the population literature tends to emphasize economic factors in explaining differences in family size. It is said that families tend to be large when children contribute economically and small when children are economically dependent on their parents. In rural societies, children do contribute economically, and Arnold et al. (1976) provide evidence that in rural societies expected economic help is mentioned as a value of children. Sociobiological theory views the maximization of inclusive fitness as the ultimate function (in an evolutionary sense) of all reproductive behavior of humans and other animals (e.g., Alexander, 1979). Such a function is not inconsistent with valuation of children for economic help or other reasons reviewed by Arnold et al. (1976). When children contribute economically, they lower the costs of raising other children and permit greater re-

productive success on the part of the parents. When children do not contribute economically, parents may maximize their reproductive success by concentrating their efforts on a smaller family. Likewise, when resources are in limited supply, parents may do better to raise a small family.
In eighteenth-century Lancashire, children were probably of some economic value to both farmers and craftsmen. In spite of poorer average survival of children of craftsmen, there was no clear evidence that craftsmen limited births. However, there was some evidence that farmers had a less circumspect attitude toward reproduction than did craftsmen. For instance, the proportion of pregnant brides among farmers was twice as high as among craftsmen. Interestingly, studies with modern U.S. populations have found that marriages of pregnant women are more common when the groom is of low occupational status (Sear, 1973), paralleling the inverse relationship between occupational class and fertility in industrial societies. Also, the mean age difference between groom and bride was significantly higher for farmers than for craftsmen, suggesting that even farmers who married relatively late in life sought young brides. A young bride would have a longer childbearing span and thus, potentially, more offspring.
