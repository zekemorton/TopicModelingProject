Measuring Mortality Trends and Differentials

ABSTRACT: The conventional approach to the measurement of mortality conceptualizes mortality as a function of the age distribution of deaths. Because at contemporary mortality levels the great bulk of deaths are concentrated at the high ages, measures based on deaths are insensitive to mortality changes over most of the life span. An alternative is to conceptualize mortality as a function of the age distribution of death rates. When this is done, large differentials in mortality by sex and by race emerge from the data, calling attention to serious social issues that have been masked by conventional mortality indicators.

One of the most significant developments of the past century has been the widespread and large-scale reduction in human mortality. It grew out of advances in the standard of living brought about by industrialization and modernization, and during the past thirty years has been accelerated in many countries by modern public health techniques. The extensive death records of many nations, some going back a century or more, provide a wealth of information about the fall in mortality. These records, by sex, age, cause-ofdeath, and other characteristics, have accordingly been the subject of numerous investigations. Nonetheless, the conventional approach to the measurement of mortality trends and differentials is predicated on a conceptualization of mortality whose nature has not been fully appreciated.
CONCEPTUALIZING MORTALITY: THE CONVENTIONAL APPROACH
The primary analytical tool for the study of mortality is the life table, which provides the basic measure of survivorship--the expectation of life. The expectation of life is the average number of future

years that will be lived under a given schedule of mortality rates. The expectation of life at birth (or the average age at death) is generally used as an index for comparing life tables and hence for comparing schedules of mortality.
The life table also provides an average mortality rate. The life table death rate, or the crude death rate of the life table, is the number of deaths occurring in the life table in one year divided by the life table population. It can be shown mathematically that the life table death rate is the reciprocal of the expectation of life at birth (for an extensive discussion of the life table, see Shyrock and Siegel, 1973, Chap. 15).
The life table death rate is conceptually similar to the two widely used indexes of mortality that do not derive from the life table. The simplest of the two is the crude death rate, the number of deaths in a population divided by the number of persons in that population. The name "crude" is well-deserved, because the crude death rate of a population is greatly influenced by the population's age composition. Two populations with the same death rates at every age but with different age composi-

tions may have quite different crude death rates.
To deal with the problem of differing age compositions, standardized death rates are frequently employed as indexes of mortality. A directly standardized death rate, DS, is of the form

DS =

P' (1)

wherenPxs is the population in some specified standard population between the ages of x and* + n, andnM^, the age-specific death rate, is equal to the observed number of deaths to persons aged x to x + n divided by the observed population aged x to x + n. In other words, the standardized death rate is the crude death rate that would be found in the standard population if the standard population experienced the observed age-specific death rates. The life table death rate is a special type of standardized death rate where the "standard" population is the population of the life table.
The three indexes mentioned above, the crude death rate, the standardized death rate, and the life table death rate are all examples of what Kitagawa (1964) calls "aggregative" indexes. This type of index aggregates the number of deaths in the numerator and the number of persons in the denominator and then takes their ratio. Because the first step is to aggregate observed (or weighted) numbers of deaths, aggregative indexes represent mortality as a function of the age distribution of deaths. For example, the life table death rate summarizes mortality as the reciprocal of the mean of the age distribution of life table deaths.
In general, studies of mortality trends and patterns have been based on one or more aggregative indexes, particularly the expectation of life at birth (e.g., see Preston et al., 1973; United Nations, 1973, p.

108ff; Arriaga and Davis, 1969; United Nations, 1963; Stolnitz, 19SS; and Dublin et al., 1949). This has been the case even though drawbacks and limitations of such indexes have been pointed out by investigators. Yerushalmy (1951) demonstrated that, in practice, aggregative indexes give disproportionately heavy weight to the higher ages. Hermalin (1966) showed that the implications of changes in the expectation of life varied with the level of life expectancy. Spiegelman and Marks (1966) emphasized the importance of choosing an "appropriate" standard population, and Kitagawa (1966) and Schoen (1970) showed that mortality differentials can vary significantly when measured by different aggregative indexes. Still, the full implications of basing mortality analysis on an adjusted age distribution of deaths have not been made clear.
THE CHANGING AGE DISTRIBUTION OF DEATHS
To examine the consequences of conceptualizing mortality in terms of the age distribution of deaths, let us consider how that distribution changes as the level of mortality falls. The study by Coale and Demeny (1966) on Regional Model Life Tables is most relevant here as it grew out of an in-depth investigation of mortality patterns by level of mortality. Coale and Demeny found that four distinctive mortality "families"--labeled "North," "South," "East," and "West" because they were somewhat related to patterns found in those areas of Europe--characterized all known life tables. In particular, they found that the characteristic pattern of mortality persisted even when the level of mortality changed.
The "West" family of model life tables, which is based largely on the experience of Western Europe and overseas European populations (including the United States), can illustrate the effects of changes in the level of mortality on the age distribution of

60 to 70 years. Hence, an increase in e from 60 to 70 years required 3.5 times as much change in the age distribution of death rates as a ten-year increase in e at low life expectancies. In the same fashion, an increase in e from 70 to 75 years involved 6.25 times as much change in del as in the life table death rate, or 6.25 times the amount of change in the age distribution of death rates than was required to raise e five years at life expectancies below 45. Substantially more change in the age distribution of death rates was necessary to raise e at high levels of e because at those levels the observed changes in death rates had much less impact on the age distribution of deaths and thus had a greatly reduced effect on e and on the life table death rate.
IMPLICATIONS OF AN ALTERNATIVE CONCEPTUALIZATION
The historical decline in mortality can be examined in terms of both the life table death rate and the geometric mean death rate. Preliminary analysis of data for the United States, England and Wales, Italy,

Japan, and Chile indicated that when mortality is measured by del, all of those countries had their most rapid improvement in mortality since 1945. However, when mortality is measured by the reciprocal of the expectation of life at birth, available data show that most Western nations had their fastest rate of mortality improvement by 1930 (United Nations, 1963), when they had substantially lower life expectancies.
The pattern of differentials in mortality as depicted by del is strikingly different from the pattern given by the life table death rate. Table 3 presents trends in differential mortality by sex for the five countries previously named and for levels of the Coale-Demeny "West" model life tables. The ratio of male to female life table death rates indicates that while the sex differential may have been increasing slowly over time, it is still quite small. In contrast, the geometric mean death rate shows a tremendous increase in the sex differential over the past thirty years. For the United States in 1970, the male del was 79 per cent greater than the female del, and for England and Wales and Italy

in 1964, the differential was over 60 per cent. Why such large differences? In the West, females enjoy substantially lower mortality than males at virtually all ages, but the concentration of deaths at the high ages renders the life table death rate relatively inflexible, while del gives equal weight to each age group.
The magnitude of the differences between the male and female age-specific death rates, which has been masked by aggregative indexes of mortality, merits more attention than it has received. In the past, a fair amount of attention has been given to sex differences in mortality, especially to the relative importance of social and biological factors, and some work has been done on the factors involved in changing sex mortality differentials (e.g., Stolnitz, 19SS;Madigan, 1957; Enterline, 1961; Preston, 1970; Klebba, 1971; Retherford, 1972; and Schoen and Collins, 1973). Yet the causes behind the expanding male/female gap are not fully understood, and there has not been any careful attempt to relate changes in social roles or in the degree of sex stereotyping to changes or potential changes in differential mortality.
Patterns of differential mortality by race are also much different when measured by del instead of by the life table death rate. Table 4 presents trends in differential mortality by race for the United States during the period 1920-70. The life table death rate shows considerably smaller differentials and, further, shows the race differential as steadily declining (except for

males in the 1960-70 period). The geometric mean death rate not only shows that a differential of over 60 per cent exists in 1970, but that, for both males and females, the 1970 differential is larger than the 1920 differential.
To explain these discrepancies, it is best to examine some of the observed death rates themselves. Table 5 gives the schedules of age-specific death rates for United States nonwhite and white females in 1920 and 1950. Except at the high ages,

the nonwhite rate at every age is considerably larger than the white rate, and (with one exception) the ratio increased between 1920 and 1950 at all ages under 75. The great influence that the high ages exert on the life table death rate produces both the smaller differentials and the reduction in the nonwhite/white gap over time. In this instance, the emphasis placed by the life table death rate on the high ages is particularly unfortunate because there is good reason to believe that nonwhite death
