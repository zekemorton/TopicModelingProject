ABSTRACT: Basic demographic data of landless and landed peasants from the highlands and valley of Northern Potosi, Bolivia, are compared. Household size and crude birth rates are larger in the highlands than in the valley. Within the highland population, no statistically significant difference was observed between the age-specific fertility of landless and landed women, nor in the survivorship ratio of their offspring. The prevalence of exchange and reciprocity at the village level may be responsible for the absence of important differences in the fertility and mortality patterns of the landed and landless.

From the sixteenth century onward, students and lay observers of Andean demography have been interested in the relationship between altitude and fertility (Monge, 1948; Clegg, 1978; Little, 1981; Stycos, 1963; Heer, 1964, 1967; James, 1966; Hoff, 1968; Whitehead, 1968; Bradshaw, 1969; Baker and Dutt, 1972;Abelson, et al., 1974; Goldstein et al., 1983). In line with this intellectual tradition, this paper addresses the question: What is the relationship between fertility and altitude within a singleayllu or Andean ethnic group? In contrast to previous studies, however, this article also asks: To what extent do fertility patterns of wealthy and poor peasants of the same ayllu living within the same high-altitude ecological zone vary? These queries are analyzed by using fairly complete village census and retrospective fertility reports of women from the Jukumani ayllu, a group of approximately 8,000 people inhabiting the northern tip of the Department of Potosi, Bolivia.
Ayllus or ethnic groups have disappeared in most Andean nations, yet they survive in some scattered regions of Bolivia such as Northern Potosi. From Colonial days onward, ayllupopulations

have been divided into several categoriesfor fiscal purposes. Some of the best known tax categories include originarios, agregados, yanaconas, and kantu runas. Despite the variety of tribute categories, two major distinctions emerged in the area under consideration: taseros and kantu runas. The former are the landed peasantry or true insiders, people who are obligated to pay land taxes (tasas) to the state; hence their nametasero. They have direct rights of access to ayllu natural resources such as farmland and grazing grounds. Kanturunas, in contrast, are later additions. Jukumani kantu runasdate back to the latter part of the nineteenth century, when they entered ayllu territory as landless laborers in search of land. They pay no taxes and, as their name suggests in Quechua, are "people of the margin," working the periphery of the tasero's plots (Platt, 1982, p. 38). In exchange for the right to work marginal parcels, kantu runas help taserosduring festivities and with agricultural chores. Since the usufruct rights of kantu runasto the margins of the land of taseros are limited and mediated by taseros, land taken by Jukumanis from neighboring ayllus during wars are given to kantu runasto sup-

people speak Spanish. Work outside the ayllu occurs among men on a seasonal basis during the agricultural slack season.
Although there is an incipient interest in trying to understand the historical origin and current function of these different types of peasants, few studies have actually tried to spell out what these tribute categories imply in terms of quality of life, mortality patterns, fertility schedules, and other vital statistics (Harris 1978, p. 56; Platt, 1982; Godoy, 1983).

there is underreporting of females born and surviving (Bolton, 1980). For instance, when discussing the number of surviving children, mothers often failed to mention married daughters living outside the village. While considerable effort was taken to check underreporting, some errors, especially in regard to sex, no doubt remain. Age determination is also a problem, especially for the older generation. Among the young, one can check the age by consulting birth certificates, an obligatory requirement for entering into the army or schools. Among the older people, un-

tively. Although these crude birth rates are higher than the national average of 40 per 1,000 population (POPLAB, 1981, p. 7), they are well within the range of other Andean communities. In Nufioa, Peru, at 4,200 meters above sea level, and at Cerro de Pasco, Peru, at 4,600 meters, Baker and Dutt (1972) found crude birth rates of 49 and 54 respectively. The crude birth rate of Vicos, Peru, located at 2,800 meters above sea level, rose from 46 in 1952 to 56 in 1963 (Alers 1971). Crude birth rates in rural Chile rise from 48 at sea level to 82 at 4,300 meters of altitude (Cruz-Coke etal.,1966).
AGE-SPECIFIC FERTILITY
As Table 2 shows, highland Jukumani women begin reproducing in their late teens; by their mid-twenties only about 30 per cent of the 21-25 year old female cohort remains childless. Of the 68 post-menopausal women interviewed, only 2 (3 per cent) had never given birth. Virtually all Jukumani women marry and enter the breeding population--even the blind and physically disabled. And, as among the neighboring Laymi ayllu, divorce and perma-

nent separation are rare (Harris, 1978a, p. 28). This contrasts with other Andean populations where marital instability is marked (Hoff, 1968; Price, 1965).
Table 2 also shows the age group specific fertility of women by five-year age cohorts. The data indicate that tasero women are most fertile from their midtwenties until their mid-thirties while kantu runa women are more fertile later in life--during their thirties. When the two peasant groups are merged, the fertility peak is shifted to the thirties. As in rural Chile (Cruz-Coke, 1966) and Nunoa, Peru, (Baker and Dutt, 1972), highland Jukumani women are more fertile later in their reproductive life.
Table 3 shows that the total fertility of highland Jukumani women past the age of 45 is about 8 offspring. On the average, a tasero women past menopause has 8.7±2.3 live births. Kantu runa women, in contrast, have about one child less (7.8±3) by the end of their reproductive careers. These differences, however, are not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Throughout their reproductive careers, highland tasero women have more children than their kantu runa counterparts, yet these dif-

ferences are not statistically significant, except for the 26-30 year old age cohort (p < 0.05).
Parity data was not obtained because women could not recall all the dates of birth and death of their offspring. Nevertheless, assuming a 21-25 year period of time from the time of first to last pregnancy (Howell, 1973, p. 253; Hoff and Abelson, 1976, p. 145) and a completed fertility ratio of 8 offspring yields a parity span of about 2.5 years. This finding is consonant with the average lactation period, which is about two years.
Although a completed fertility ratio of 8 is higher than the national rural average of 6 children (POPLAB, 1981,p. 10), it is within the range of other highaltitude Andean population estimates. The completed fertility ratio of the Chilean Aymara studied by Cruz-Coke and his associates ranged from 6 to 8.5 (Cruz-Coke et al., 1966). The postmenopausal Bolivian Aymara women studied by Dutt (1976, 1980) had a total 6 live births. The completed fertility ratio in Nunoa and Cerro de Pasco was 6.7 and 7.6 (Hoff, 1968;Baker, 1978; Goldstein et al. 1983, p. 43).

MORTALITY
Within the highland territory there are no statistically significant differences in the infant and child mortality patterns of taseros and kantu runas(Table 4). On the average, a Jukumani woman past the age of 45 has had about 8 children of whom about four survive to adulthood. This figure gives the Jukumani population a survival ratio of approximately 0.50, lower than the ratio for rural Cochabamba (0.78) at 2,600 meters above sea level and rural La Paz (0.63) at an elevation of 3,800 meters (Dutt, 1980, p. 109).
DISCUSSION
The higher household size and crude birth rates of highlanders suggests that hypoxic stress may not depress fertility (Goldstein et al., 1983). Despite the relative isolation of the Jukumani population and its traditional character, the higher ecological zones are more benign and economically important than the valleys. The higher zones are closer to the mines and markets and are free from

Likewise, an old lasero married couple with fewor no children will invite a kantu runa family with many children to take care of them in their old age and to bury them in exchange for the rights of access to land. Through a variety of such mechanisms discussed at length elsewhere (Godoy, 1983), the survival and mortality patterns of taxpayers and marginal peasants may be equalized.
