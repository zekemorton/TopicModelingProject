ABSTRACT: Although geneticists studying schizophrenia have made great advances by means of quasi-experimental studies of twins and of adoptees and their parents, epidemiologic studies of broader populations are now called for to investigate the role of social factors together with genetic factors in the etiology of schizophrenia. To form a productive partnership, epidemiology and genetics must not only build on their separate achievements but also overcome problems in their research methods. One problem is that studies limited to treated cases may yield biased results. Second, in the past, variations in diagnostic criteria have led to confusing results in both genetic and epidemiologic research. It is proposed that future research use improved epidemiologic procedures now available and build on the strong epidemiologic finding of an inverse relation between social class and prevalence of schizophrenia to test genetic models by investigating class-specific rates of disorder in particular kinds of relatives.

In their research on schizophrenia, geneticists have done an impressive set of elegant quasi-experiments. We refer not only to studies of monozygotic and dizygotic twins, but also to adoption studies. The latter include both follow-up investigations of the adopted children of schizophrenic mothers as against nonschizophrenic mothers, and studies of the biological and adoptive parents of schizophrenic adoptees. The results of this body of quasi-experimental research lead convincingly to two conclusions. First, heredity is a factor in the etiology of schizophrenia. Second, the magnitude of its influence leaves considerable room for social factors.
For all their elegance, twin and adoption studies are poor designs for studying the influence of varied social conditions on the development of schizophrenia. The populations of twins and of adoptees are both too small and too restricted to represent the full range of possible social influences, such

as variation in social class. Therefore, geneticists are turning to studies of broader populations and hence to epidemiologic research to fill in the picture of the etiology of schizophrenia. To form a productive partnership for this purpose, epidemiology and genetics must not only build on their separate achievements but also overcome problems in the research methods that they bring with them. Let us see what these problems are and how we may solve them.
Most epidemiologic studies of schizophrenia are based on admissions to psychiatric treatment, usually on hospital admissions. The question is how accurately these rates indicate the magnitude of the problem of schizophrenia in general populations. Many epidemiologists, particularly in Europe, have based their studies on the tenet that all schizophrenics are eventually treated in hospitals (0degaard, 1961). Nor is this belief restricted to European researchers. Dunham, one of the pioneers in

American psychiatric epidemiology, stated a similar opinion and cited A. H. Leighton, the director of the Stirling County study, as saying in a private conversation that most persons who show symptoms of schizophrenia, at least among those living in urban industrial centers, are likely to come to official recognition not long after the symptoms become manifest (Dunham, 1965,pp. 33-34).
Despite its importance, surprisingly few investigators have studied the relation of untreated to treated rates of schizophrenia in the general population. Only a small minority of studies that reported the true prevalence of schizophrenia in a community included data on which of the subjects judged to be cases had ever been in treatment with members of the mental health professions. We have found seven such epidemiologic studies.
COMPARISON OF "TRUE" AND TREATED RATES
The findings from these seven studies are summarized in Table 1. Clearly, they do not provide a simple answer to the question of what proportion of schizophrenics receive treatment for their disorder. At one extreme, Bremer (1951) reported in his study of a small Norwegian fishing village that all cases had been treated, thus sup-

porting the position of epidemiologists such as 0degaard, Leighton, and Dunham. At the other extreme, Brunetti (1964) found that only 50per cent of cases he identified in a small town in France had been treated. The question is: Which of these figures is closer to the truth?
For a possible answer to this question, we turn our attention to an aspect of the procedures in these studies. In order to identify cases, these investigators made diagnoses based on interview data collected from community informants and, in many instances, from the subjects themselves. In general, their finding when all types of disorder are considered is that the more severe the diagnosis the greater the likelihood that persons identified as cases had been treated for the disorder (Link and Dohrenwend, 1978). This finding coincides neatly with the expectation that the more ill a person is, the more likely he or she is to enter treatment. However, an alternate explanation, which is particularly applicable to schizophrenia, is suggested by some results from an epidemiologic study by Helgason (1964) of a two-year birth cohort in Iceland. He reported two levels of diagnostic certainty: definite and questionable. He also reported how many of the cases at each level of certainty had been in treatment. Among 36 definite cases of schizophrenia, 83 per cent had been in treatment whereas only 33 per

lected to illustrate the effect of varying individual criteria on the frequency of diagnosing the presence of schizophrenia in an extensively studied sample of 114 twins. The two Scandinavian psychiatrists, when operating within a traditional continental European framework, had the lowest yield of schizophrenic diagnoses, and one of these two, when he employed the criteria for the spectrum of schizophrenia disorders, had the highest.
We cannot and should not attempt to specify at this time which definition of schizophrenia is correct. It is critical, however, that we be explicit and precise about what definition is being used in a given study so that the results can be interpreted and related to those of other studies.
In working with rates or ratios we must be confident not only that we understand what went into the numerator, but also that we have used the appropriate denominator for the purpose of the study. To illustrate, Yolles and Kramer (1969), summarizing various prevalence rates for schizophrenia in the literature, reported a lifetime prevalence from the study of Essen-Moller (1956) in rural southern Sweden of 6.7 per 1,000 population (Table 2). Essen-Moller

himself and other psychiatric geneticists (e.g., Zerbin-Riidin, 1967) reported a lifetime risk of developing schizophrenia of 11.2 per 1,000 for the very same study. The discrepancy stems from the difference in use to which the rates are put, and both schools of thought are correct for their own purposes. The testing and fitting of genetic models requires an age-corrected rate that uses a denominator of risk-lives observed. Yolles and Kramer considered the denominator of the total Essen-Moller sample, 2,550, while genetic investigators calculated that this sample yielded only 1,515 risk-lives. Both used the same numerator of the number of actual schizophrenic cases. Such gaps in communication retard the advancement of research on schizophrenia.
Given the problems of variation in diagnostic criteria and, to a lesser extent, of the base used to calculate rates, we should not look for accurate absolute estimates of the true prevalence of schizophrenia in the population in general or in particular subgroups from available epidemiologic studies. What we can determine is whether there are consistencies in the relative rates reported for subgroups within studies; for instance, whether men are consistently re-

Until fairly recently, such research involving large samples of subjects from the general population would have seemed impractical. Not only are large scale epidemiologic studies expensive, but the problems of accurate case identification and classification have seemed insurmountable, given the lack of agreement about how to define schizophrenia and measure its characteristics.
There is no way that large scale epidemiologic investigations can be done both cheaply and well. Major advances in measurement procedures, however, suggest that they can be done far better than in the past and, within the framework of two-stage identification and classification procedures, with a degree of economy. The prospects look good for collaboration

in epidemiologic studies between environmentally oriented and genetically oriented investigators concerned with understanding the causes of schizophrenia.
