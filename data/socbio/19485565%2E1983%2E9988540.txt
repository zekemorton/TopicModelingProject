ABSTRACT: Presented are data on fertility levels in thirty Moslem countries between 1960 and 1980. Fertility measures include: crude birth rate, total fertility rate and age-specific birth rate, and the per cent change in them between 1960 and 1980. The analysis focuses on: (1) the current status of Moslem fertility, (2) the emerging fertility differentials among Moslem countries, and (3) the degree to which recent fertility declines in some Moslem countries is associated with modernization variables and family planning efforts. Results indicate that: (a) Moslem fertility remains universally high and is generally higher than non-Moslem countries in the same region; (ft) few Moslem countries have succeeded in reducing their levels of fertility to justify a search for the predictors of Moslem fertility levels; (c) in spite of a sufficient range of variations in the economic and social correlates of fertility, the corresponding fertility variables in these countries do not suggest that the reproductive behavior of Moslem women has reacted to such variations; and (d) efforts directed toward stronger family planning programs are clearly related to fertility decline.

Numerous demographers have taken the view that Roman Catholicism with its general condemnation of contraception has been a powerful factor in upholding large family norms especially in

tholicism (1968, p. 231). Kirk attributed the high birth rate in Moslem countries not only to religious doctrine but also to "distinctive Islamic attitudes and practices in family life."

tility control is not prohibited in Islam and that the purpose of marriage in Islam is held to be not only for procreation but also for the gratification of spiritual and physical needs. The Quaran has historically been interpreted as justifying coitus interpetus to protect the male's property, to preserve the wife's health, and to allay anxiety over numerous children.
Today Moslem Jurists support measures to prevent conception, and in several Moslem countries religious leaders have endorsed family planning programs. Only abortion and sterilization still meet with strong opposition from religious authorities. Nonetheless, the opinion has been repeatedly expressed that Islam may offer a prolonged resistance to fertility decline because of the institutional pressures among its population to have many children, especially sons, because of the low status of women, and because the population of almost all Moslem countries consists largely of culturally conservative peasantry (Abd-Ati, 1975; Driver, 1963; Mazur, 1967; Rizk, 1963). Such pronatalist sentiment in Islam can be seen in the emphasis put on early and universal marriage, easy marriage of divorcees, and limited career opportunities for women outside the home.
While the controversy as to whether Islam encourages large families continues, some studies (United Nations, 1971) contend that high fertility of Moslem women may have been encouraged by: (1) a fatalistic attitude in Islam stemming from a strong belief in the active providence of God; (2) the shyness of Moslem women which stymied their interest in fertility regulation; and (3) the choice of family limitation methods-- the IUD, for example, may not be readily acceptable to Moslem couples be-

cause of spotting and bleeding which may render the woman ritually unclean.
However, in contrast to Catholicism, there is no clear doctrinal injunction against most methods of birth control. It was suggested that such lack of religious injunctions against methods of birth control may actually prove to be a double-edged sword (Fiset, 1969). Variations in interpretations of what constitute acceptable practices in Islam could conceivably allow the acceptance of contraceptive techniques or could conversely effect a back-lash against fertility control programs.
Regardless of how one interprets Islam's position on nuptiality, much has become known during the last twenty years, both empirically and conceptually, about trends in Moslem fertility that require integration and interpretation. Specifically there is a need to: (1) examine recent trends in Moslem fertility during the sixties and the seventies; (2) compare and contrast fertility trends and differentials not only to nonMoslem countries, but also among Moslem countries themselves; and (3) explain trends in Moslem fertility in accordance with the prevailing assumptions about fertility decline--namely, those of the demographic transition model--and family planning, as well as age of marriage and the infant mortality hypotheses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study covers thirty countries in which Islam is the religion of more than 60 per cent of the total population. The majority of these countries, but not all of them, are members of the Islamic conference. There are many other millions of Moslems in the world that are

tries was noticeably higher than those for non-Moslem countries in the same region, and substantially much higher than the world average of 3.8. The rates for these Moslem countries were even higher than the 4.4 average for the less developed countries (Population Reference Bureau, 1980). Although the need to rely on different data year base (1970) precludes any definite conclusions pertaining to observed declines since 1970, the rates for 1970 and 1980 clearly support the conclusions pertaining to (1) the very high fertility characteristic of Moslem populations in general, and (2) the wide range of variation in the fertility levels of the different Islamic countries.
Further evidence of the existence of significant differences in the fertility behavior of Islamic populations is revealed by the age-specific birth rates presented in Table 2. The data from the 11 countries for which comparable rates are available clearly reveals the lack of a single pattern that can describe the fertility experience of the Moslem world. Nevertheless, several interesting observations can be drawn from this table. First, there is a very wide range in the level of fertility of young Moslem women, from a very high rate in Bangladesh to a low rate in Egypt. This wide fertility range among young women age 15-19 can be explained partly by differences in the legal age of marriage. In addition it probably reflects differences in the percentage of women age 15-19 who were married, their contraceptive behavior, and, possibly, differences in adolescent subfecundity. Second, Moslem women seem to continue to be reproductively active at a much later age (40 and over) than women in Western societies. Finally, the few countries that experienced noticeable TFR declines also experienced

decreases in the fertility of both young and old women. Tunisia, however, represents an anomaly in which birth rates for young women increased between 1971 and 1976 while the TFR declined.
The trends in age-specific fertility rates reveal some regional differences as well. First, declining fertility among young women was noticeable in Malaysia and Indonesia from 1967 to 1975. However, fertility decline was at a slightly slower rate among younger women than among older women in Indonesia. In contrast, in Malaysia and Bangladesh fertility declined somewhat faster among younger women than among older women. In the Middle East, on the other hand, decreases in the fertility of older women seem to be more significant than the decrease in fertility among younger women. The only exception here occurred in Bahrain, where fertility declines were more pronounced at the younger ages. Thus, even where similar downward trends in total fertility can be observed they may reflect markedly different patterns of decline with respect to the ages of the women participating; and these differences in turn will be very important in determining the nature of programs aimed at promoting further declines in overall fertility.

tries, even those that rank fairly high on several development indexes, may be the existence of fairly high infant mortality rates (i.e., with the exception of Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, and Malaysia, all Islamic countries covered in Table 4 had infant mortality rates well in excess of 100). While there may be some sound basis for arguing that mortality decline is necessary for fertility decline, this is no guarantee that the former will lead to the latter. In the present analysis, for.example, Kuwait and Malaysia both had infant mortality rates of 41; but Kuwait has had a fairly stable high birth rate throughout the period since 1960, whereas that of Malaysia has declined by roughly 30 per cent. Similarly, a relatively low infant mortality rate is associated with a notable fertility decline in Lebanon but with the persistence of a very high CBR in Jordan. Thus, the degree of correspondence that is generally assumed between the epidemiological transition and fertility decline does not always apply (Omran, 1977), and the idea that a substantial decline in infant mortality will automatically encourage a corresponding reduction in fertility is not substantiated in the case of the Moslem countries examined here.
One other variable requires some discussion, and that is education. According to much of the literature, education tends to have a markedly depressing effect on fertility. With education comes a broadening of one's horizons, increased knowledge, a breakdown in traditional attitudes and beliefs, and a variety of other social psychological accompaniments of modernization (e.g., a stronger achievement orientation)--all of which are likely to encourage effects to gain a greater measure of control over one's fertility (Hawthorn, 1970; Durch, 1981).
Although an adequate assessment of

the relative importance for fertility decline of the several variables presented in Table 4 requires a more sophisticated statistical analysis than can be undertaken here, there is some evidence to support this thesis. For example, those countries which have experienced the greatest fertility declines since 1960 (Lebanon, Malaysia, Turkey, Tunisia, Indonesia) tend to have higher rates of literacy and/or a higher percentage of the eligible population enrolled in primary or secondary school. Conversely, those countries with the highest crude birth rates today (Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria) generally rank very low on both these measures. Once again, however, there are some notable exceptions: Jordan and Iraq, for example, both rank fairly high on the two education measures, yet both are characterized by persistent high birth rates, a pattern which is also somewhat characteristic of Kuwait, Libya, and Syria. Thus, once again there is only a weak association between the expectations of transition theory and Moslem fertility behavior.
To summarize briefly: Classical demographic transition theory bases its expectation of declining fertility on the onset of the modernization process and empirically measurable improvements in the social and economic well-being of a population; but the evidence presented here for the Moslem countries fails to give credence to many of the hypotheses implied in this demographic transition model. The major problems noted can be summed up as follows:
(1) Economic activity rates, urbanization, and improvement in health, per capita GNP, and even in educational level are not obviously related to overall fertility levels in most of the Middle Eastern and North African countries.
(2) In Africa, neither urbanization

(3) TheMoslem countries that experienced clear fertility decline exhibitdifferent combinations of the traits enumerated.
(4) The country that has recently shown a steep fertility decline (Indonesia) exhibits little aggregate social change that can explain itsrapidly declining fertility.
It seems reasonable then to conclude

that the emergence of fertility differences among Moslem countries can hardly be attributed to a clear association with aggregate socioeconomic changes commonly assumed to bepart of the demographic transition (Teitelbaum, 1975).

nomic development as opposed to vigorous family planning programs to the onset and maintenance of fertility decline in the Third World countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America. On the one hand, there are those who adhere to the classical demographic transition model with its expectation of declining fertility as a response to the modernization process and empirically measurable changes in the social and economic well-being of a population. On the other hand, there are those who see the key to fertility decline in an active and vigorous family planning program.2 In this section we shall consider the relative influence of family planning efforts.
Table 5 presents data on the 1968-75 percentage decline in the total fertility rate of Moslem countries that have been grouped on the basis of the strength of their family planning program efforts. This classification was developed by Mauldin and Berelson and is based on the availability or lack of a variety of family planning services. Individual country scores range from 0-26, with scores of 20 or more taken to indicate a strong family planning program, 10-19a moderate program, and 0-9 a weak program.3 An examination of Table 5 clearly reveals the importance of family planning efforts for fertility decline in the Islamic world. Among countries with no program the declines in the total fertility rate between 1970 and 1980 ranged from +17 to -15 per cent, with

tus category, show no decline or an increase in TFR. The only exception was Kuwait. Second, those four countries that fell into the high socioeconomic status category, and did not have a family planning program, have not shown any notable decrease in fertility, Kuwait being an exception. Similarly, those 10 countries that fell into the lower socioeconomic status category had little or no decrease in fertility.
The major conclusions to be drawn from the cross-classification presented in Table 6 are as follows: (1) Fertility reduction in those few Moslem countries showing a definite declining trend can clearly be related to family-planning efforts. (2) Socioeconomic changes in the absence of family planning efforts have produced little, if any, decline in fertility. (3) When the two factors are combined it is clear that family planning efforts exert a greater influence on fertility decline than socioeconomic changes.
STATUS OF WOMEN AND FERTILITY
DECLINE
Although a direct connection remains to be established, the subordinate position of women, which appears to be an entrenched part of the Moslem culture, is usually suggested as an important factor maintaining fertility ofMoslem women at a higher level (Allman, 1978). Status of women can be measured in many different ways. Although not always acceptable as indicators,4 changes in women's status are thought to be reflected in matters related to women's ability to exercise their rights in marriage, divorce, education, work,
4This approach has been criticized as having an evaluative approach along the Western experience (see Safilios-Rothschilds, 1970).

and participation in public life (Curtin, 1982; Dixon, 1975).
Researchers who investigated therelationships between the status of Moslem women and their fertility behavior isolated several factors as possible interpretive linkages between the two sets of variables. Youssif (1978) explained the position of the single women in Moslem countries as being most precarious which leads toward (1) seclusion of women from the larger society, (2) restricted employment outside the home, and (3) tight parental control and supervision of early marriage.
Changes in the age at marriage are normally accompanied by a variety of socioeconomic changes that reflect and are part of the modernization process. One of the great difficulties in studying age at marriage and fertility ties is determining what cause and effects relationships exist among age at marriage, fertility, and socioeconomic factors. Intensive investigation of this topic demonstrates that the relationship between age at first marriage and fertility is not always as simple as had been previously assumed. It is generally believed however that delayed marriage has played a significant role in the fertility decline of some Western countries (Yaukey,1965; Hajnal, 1965; Dixon, 1971,1978).
Understandably, the relationship between age at marriage and fertility changes in Moslem countries should be most relevant since it is repeatedly asserted that (1) Moslem culture encourages early female marriage and insures almost universal marriage and (2) because of the strict sexual conduct in Moslem culture, marriage represents the socially sanctioned initiation of sexual activities and childbearing for women.

has not been largely responsible for the drop in the total fertility note. Fertility change among women under 25 accounted for only 20 per cent of the decline in the total fertility rate in Egypt and 28 per cent in Turkey (see Table 7). In Bahrain, declining fertility among younger women has been a major factor in the overall fertility decline between 1965 and 1966; about 16 per cent of the decline occurred among the youngest age group and 42 per cent among women age 20-24, or a total of 58 per cent among women under 25. A marriage squeeze, caused by high birth rates before 1970, the custom of men marrying women 5 to 10 years younger than they, and the out-migration of men, may have been major causes of delay in Bahrain marriage (Deming and Van Arsdol, 1980).
The birth rate may be reduced either by decreases in the marital fertility rate due to family planning or due to a decrease in the population married. Thus, by knowing the proportion of women who have ever been married by age, we are able to illustrate not only how early women marry but also how rapidly and how thoroughly marriage spreads through the female population.
The available results from the World Fertility Survey (WFS) indicate some patterns that are relevant to Moslem fertility. At the time the survey was conducted, there was a great deal of variation among Moslem countries in respect to how widespread early marriage was among their populations. For example, while about 70 per cent of the 15-19year-old women in Bangladesh were married, only 53 per cent were married in Malaysia and closer to 37 per cent in each of Pakistan and Indonesia. The results of the survey, however, show

that between 20-24 some 80 per cent of women were married and between ages 25-50 about 99 per cent of women were married (Durch, 1981).
What these findings clearly indicate is that the presumed value of delayed marriage in reducing fertility may be limited, if such delay merely results in compressing the time it takes for most women to marry, a pattern which appears to be prevailing in Moslem society. Universal marriage is the rule in most Moslem countries.
Just as marriage increases the likelihood of childbearing, marital dissolution decreases it. Though, it is a common Western belief that divorce is much easier among the Moslem population, there is a wide variation among Moslem countries in the prevalence of divorce. In Asia, for example, levels of divorce are not really linked with religion. A high level of divorce exists in Indonesia, and a low level in Pakistan, although both are predominately Moslem. In the Middle East, while Egypt has one of the highest divorce rates, Syria has one of the lowest rates (Momeni, 1972; Buza and Baldwin, 1977).
The timing of divorce and remarriage of women also affect fertility. For example, divorce at early age has a different effect on fertility than divorce at a later age. Similarly, divorce followed almost immediately by remarriage has little effect on fertility, while divorce not followed immediately by remarriage could have a depressing effect on fertility. Once again, the published data on the World Fertility Survey (WFS) have some bearing on these issues. The results show that in the median countries where data were available, marital dissolution due to divorce is most common among older women whose fecun-

dity is lowest. The easy marriage of divorced women in Moslem countries is also a common practice (Durch, 1981). In brief, in most Moslem countries, an average woman of reproductive age, once married, spent a very large proportion of her time in a marital union.
To summarize briefly, the trend toward relatively later marriage in several Moslem countries has produced little effect on the overall level of marriage and does not appear to be a significant factor in fertility decline except in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Tunisia (Brown and Wry, 1974;Taylor, 1975;Hassan, 1975).
The age structure of a population and particularly the percentage of women in the reproductive age group has an effect on fertility. Table 8 presents data on the percentage of women in the reproductive age group and TFR in 1980. The range of this age group, in Moslem countries, is rather narrow and is set between 15 and 44. It is interesting to note though that the countries which show the percentage of women in the reproductive age group as less than 42 per cent have relatively higher TFR's. The 14 countries that fall in this range had TFR is of 6.5 and over, and 3 of them had TFR's of 7 and over. It is interesting to note that, conversely, the countries that have more than 43 per cent of women in the reproductive age group have relatively lower TFR's. these countries are Indonesia, Egypt, Tunisia, Lebanon, Malaysia, and Turkey.
This pattern is hard to explain. It is possible however, that a relative shortage of marriageable females reinforces the societal push toward both earlier age at marriage and universal marriage. This phenomena of a possible "marriage boom" stands in contrast to what is known about other cases of "marriage

CONCLUSIONS
The purpose of this paper was to assemble much of the data available for estimating the recent trends and present level of fertility for thirty Moslem coun-

260 Nagi SocialBiology

tries. On the basis of the evidence, the author questioned the impact of religion on fertility level in these countries. In general, Moslem fertility was found to be universally high, and noticeably higher than that of non-Moslem countries at similar levels of development.
This paper's analysis shows, however, that fertility transition appears to be underway in at least six or seven of these Moslem countries. In the rest of the Moslem world, fertility has shown little or no trend toward sustained decline.
The most striking finding to emerge from the data is that in the few countries where fertility has started to decline it has often declined under remarkably adverse socioeconomic and demographic conditions. The data present no clear evidence that aggregate indicators of socioeconomic development would explain the timing of fertility decline.
Clearly, large differences in the level of development exist among the thirty Moslem countries, and it seems safe to conclude that there is no easily definable threshold of social and economic progress required for their fertility to begin to decline.
The evidence gathered for these thirty countries show a generally high level of infant mortality in Moslem countries. Such high infant mortality prevalent in these countries may in part explain their high level of fertility. However, the hypothesis that a substantial decline in infant mortality will automatically produce a corresponding reduction in fertility is not substantiated in the case of the countries examined here. The two countries which had the lowest rates of infant mortality (Kuwait and Malaysia) have very dissimilar TFR's.
Of the thirty countries surveyed in this study, rising age of marriage has contributed substantially to fertility decline in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Tuni-

sia. In other countries, rising age of marriage has. not always been associated with decrease in fertility. In fact, some paradoxical cases can be observed where increase in age at marriage was accompanied by an increase in the fertility of young women 15-19, (Tunisia).
Although the association between rising age at marriage and fertility reduction showed an inconsistent pattern among the thirty countries, there are in our opinion at least three reasons to believe that rising age at marriage could have a noticeable impact on fertility decline in the Moslem countries in comparison to other regions: (1) In the few Moslem countries where fertility level has been falling rapidly, delayed marriage was partially responsible for such decline, along with other factors, in particular, effective family planning programs. (2) In the Moslem countries, marriage signifies the initiation of female sexual activity. Thus, an increase in age at marriage in these countries will mean postponement of sexual activities and first birth. (3) During the rest of this century, a large percentage of the population will be young adults in their peak reproductive years.
The data presented in this study give a clear demonstration of how efforts given to family planning programs as a means of reducing fertility have shown a close relationship with fertility reduction. The countries which have moderate family planning programs have reported the most rapid fertility decline. The implication of such a conclusion as far as the impact of religion is the focal question, however, should be viewed with considerable caution. It should be emphasized that although Islam represents the common cultural tradition in these thirty countries, these countries encompass a variety of other cultural settings that could induce the persist-
