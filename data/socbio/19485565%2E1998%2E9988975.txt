ABSTRACT. Pregnancy is the period during which a mother prepares herself physically and psychologically for the delivery and care of the offspring. However, during this period the central concern is the welfare of the baby, but not the mother. When the mother and the child subsequently become two separate beings, the mother's health care is totally neglected unless she develops obvious symptoms of gross physiological and psychological abnormalities. This study, which was carried out in three MOH areas of the Kalutara District on maternal morbidity, had two main objectives. The first was to determine the prevalence of puerperal morbidity and the second was to identify characteristics of those with high levels of morbidity. Of the mothers who are registered by the PHM of the study area 600 were selected for this study. Data were collected using structured interviews conducted within the first week after puerperium (43-50 days after delivery). The morbidity rate revealed by the study is much higher than expected. Excessive bleeding from the vagina was reported by 40 per cent of mothers, while minor symptoms like breast engorgement and chills were reported by many mothers. Only 11 per cent of the mothers in the study did not have any symptoms or signs of ill health, and the rest reported one or more illnesses. Primae gravidae and those who experienced pregnancy wastage during an early pregnancy had a higher morbidity.

Mothers in the Third World, and more specifically in South Asia, with their limited resources, and cultural setup rarely get the opportunity to think of their own health problems except when these are life threatening. It is not surprising that women who have been culturally conditioned to put themselves last on the priority order are reluctant to admit having health problems or seek medical help, especially if the ailment is considered personal and shameful, as is often the case with ailments related to reproductive health (Bang et al., 1989; Jejeebhoy, 1994). A large share of women in

developing countries place most of their personal needs, including dietary intake, after those of their children, husband, and sometimes, other family members. Because of these attitudes and practices, many mothers suffer serious health problems requiring professional care but they do not realize this due to ignorance (Datta etal., 1980; Mathai, 1989).
Over the last several decades, maternal health care in Sri Lanka has improved considerably compared to other developing nations. However, for cultural and economic reasons, puerperal1 maternal

health care has been lagging behind when compared with the pregnancy period. Although the mother has become a beneficiary of health care attention during the pregnancy period, the attention is basically on the child which the mother carries inside her body, but not on the mother herself. Thus, when the mother and the child become two separate beings, attention is paid to maternal health care only if the mother develops gross symptoms of physical or psychological pathology. Even though such conditions could be fatal, many mothers manage to survive but endure the health consequences for the rest of their lives (Bhatia and Cleland, 1995).
A mother's situation becomes worse when she has to go to work, when she belongs to an economically deprived community or social class, and when her family is large and children are not properly spaced. In such situations, mothers have to fend for themselves, without realizing the risks involved. Therefore, the main objectives of the present paper are to examine the prevalence of puerperal morbidity in Sri Lankan society and also to identify the mothers who have experienced relatively higher morbidity conditions in the puerperium than others by using a community level survey. Such
rum," even though heavily used in the literature, has no specific definition with regard to the health care of mothers immediately following childbirth (Brady and Winikoff, 1992). A number of studies of maternal deaths, however, have extended the scope of the definition to include deaths occurring up to three months after delivery (Koenig et al., 1988) or even up to one year (Walker et al., 1986). When considering morbidity, we find that definition may become even more difficult since some problems--for example, infertility as a result of infection incurred at delivery--may not become apparent for many years after the causative event (Campbell and Graham, 1991).

information can be used to formulate appropriate interventions to minimize ill health during this period of motherhood.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
In Sri Lanka, previous research has rarely focused on maternal morbidity and has been limited to hospital-based statistics. Hospital-based statistics are not likely to yield an accurate picture since many morbid conditions are not referred to the hospital system (Fortney, 1995). The hospital-based maternal morbidity can therefore be thought of as the tip of the iceberg. Thus, an important goal has been to gather information on maternal morbidity and care by using communitybased surveys, where mothers and health care workers answer questions about their experiences.
Problems that are specific to women and related to their reproductive processes can be divided into two groups. First, problems occurring during pregnancy, delivery, and puerperium, referred to in the medical literature as obstetric (maternal) morbidity. Second, problems occurring to nonpregnant women and outside the puerperal period of six weeks, known as gynecological morbidity. The present study obtained reports on perceived maternal morbidity.2 Thus, questions on symptoms of maternal morbidity were formulated to be administered in sequence, starting with symptoms during pregnancy, and then proceeding to those during delivery, and ending with symptoms during the first six
2No validation method like a medical examination follow-up was adopted to check self-perceived illness. By and large in developing countries morbidity is measured through the self-perceived approach which is based on pain and suffering reported by individuals (Gumber and Chen, 1996).

weeks in the postpartum period (puerperium).
A policy to improve maternal health in Sri Lanka depends on its ability to yield a broad diagnosis of the problem when applied in a community setting. Therefore, the study first conducted a number of focus group discussions with mothers in the post-puerperium and with health personnel in different locations of the study area to investigate the prevalence and nature of women's perception of maternal morbidity. Secondly, the study used structured interviews to obtain detailed information on the puerperium from mothers who had just completed that period. The analysis made in the present paper is based on the second data source only.
The collection of data from 600 mothers using structured interview schedules was done within one week following their puerperium (i.e., 43-50 days after the delivery). Identification of mothers for the interview was carried out by the research team3 with the assistance of 24 research assistants (enumerators) who had received special training4 from a number of experts before the field work. Identification of mothers was done by using the Public Health Midwives5 (PHM's) registers in se-

lected areas of Kalutara district. The district is located about 50 km south of the capital city of Colombo and represents many socioeconomic characteristics of Sri Lankan society. The respondents were selected from the three Medical Officers of Health (MOH) areas,6 namely, Kalutara, Beruwala, and Matugama, in the Kalutara district (Table 1).
The three MOH areas altogether comprise 105 PHM areas, and each enumerator selected for the study was required to cover 3-5 PHM areas. Each enumerator was first asked to make a primary visit to each mother identified by the PHM's register and to check for her availability for the interview. A minimum of three visits was made to locate a mother. If she had moved to her parent's place or elsewhere, attempts were made to obtain her new address and to locate her. The enumerators continued to identify mothers for the study using the eligibility criteria given to them until each enumerator identified and interviewed approximately 25 mothers from the allocated PHM areas for the purpose.
According to the eligibility criteria, the mother had to satisfy three conditions in order to be selected for the interview.

3The research team was comprised of three experts, a principal investigator and two coinvestigators. The principal investigator was a population and health expert, and the coinvestigators were experts on sociology and medical science respectively.
4Female health volunteers of the Kalutara district were selected and trained as the enumerators for the field work. They all had at least ten years of schooling, and in fact some had a university education. Training of enumerators lasted one week, which included formal lectures and training in the field sites. During the training it was emphasized how to use the questionnaire to obtain relevant information on socioeconomic status, maternal morbidity, and health-seeking behavior from the mothers.
5Registration of pregnant mothers in her area during home visits within the first four months of pregnancy is

considered as one of the main duties of the Public Health Midwife (PHM) in Sri Lanka. The PHM, through systematic home visits, should also provide care to pregnant and postpartum mothers and to newborns in their respective PHM areas. The PHM is the "front line" health worker who provides home health care, who also distributes oral pills and condoms, and who regularly follows-up family planning users and assists at MCH clinics.
6Of the three MOH areas where the study was conducted, the first two come under the supervision of the National Institute of Health Sciences of Sri Lanka (NIHS). Mothers in the MOH area of Kalutara, despite having a large general hospital, are served by a larger number of private health providers than the mothers in the Beruwala and Matugama MOH areas which can be categorized as semi-urban and rural respectively.

First, she had to have a live birth about 43-50 days before the intended date of interview. Secondly, the child had to be alive7 at the time of the interview. Thirdly, the mother had to live currently in the study area. The selection, location and interviewing of mothers, at the time when eligible, took place from June to September 1996. The enumeration was not conducted simultaneously in all three MOH areas because of difficulty in supervision. Enumerators were given a maximum duration of two months to identify and complete the interviews with the eligible respondents. As a result of migration to
7Mothers whose youngest child died during the 42 days after birth form an interesting group, but in the study population the number of such mothers was very small because of low infant mortality in Sri Lanka. A mother who has lost her child during the puerperium is more likely to be suffering from ill health, both physically and psychologically, than a mother whose child is surviving in the same period. However, because of the small numbers and the difficulty in interviewing them, those mothers who lost a child during puerperium were not included in the study.
During 1996, the infant mortality rate of the study area was found to be 18 per 1,000 live births. The figure is comparable with the infant mortality rate of the whole country. Since the study interviewed about 600 mothers (assuming one live birth per mother), only 11 infant deaths are expected. Since deaths in the first six weeks of infancy contribute about 60 per cent of the total infant deaths in Sri Lanka, the expected number of infant deaths to these 600 mothers is further lowered to about 6 deaths.

their mother's residence before the delivery and co-residence there for a few weeks even after the delivery, about 5 per cent of the eligible mothers could not be located in the field for enumeration. The percentage of partial or full refusals were negligible.
The study attempted to examine demographic, socioeconomic, and pregnancy- and delivery-related determinants of morbidity condition during the puerperium through univariate and multivariate (ordered logit models) statistical techniques. Particularly, the analysis was strengthened by developing an "index of morbidity" which represents each enumerated mother's level of morbidity during the puerperium.
RESULTS
PREVALENCE OF ILLNESS AND ITS LEVEL OF SEVERITY
Mothers in general believe that ill health following childbirth is a natural phenomenon which requires no professional help. Therefore, an attempt has been made in the study to collect a range of puerperal illnesses and symptoms which are expected to be experienced by any members of the study population during

the puerperium. Since mothers were interviewed just a few days after the end of the puerperium,8 it is very unlikely that they have had any major recall bias for these conditions.
The collection of information on illnesses and symptoms was done by using two strategies. First, mothers were asked to self-report (voluntarily) all illnesses and symptoms that they experienced during the puerperium along with the level of severity, i.e., "very serious," "serious," or "not serious," for each reported illness or symptom. In the second strategy, mothers were questioned about the experience of puerperal illnesses and symptoms by providing a brief description of each of the conditions she had not voluntarily reported. For each of the illnesses and symptoms reported through this approach, she was also questioned about the level of its severity. Thus, reports derived by the first and second strategies could be called "unprompted" and "prompted" responses, respectively.
Clearly, the experience of ill health during the puerperium by these mothers is much higher than expected. With the low level of maternal mortality9 in Sri Lanka, one would expect to have a low level of
8It should be noted that illnesses and symptoms which mothers experienced during the six-week period following all previous births were also collected in the study. However, at the time of enumeration, it was observed that most mothers tend to underestimate the morbid conditions that they experienced during the previous puerperal periods. Therefore, the present study reports the prevalence of illnesses and symptoms experienced during the recent puerperium only. The prevalence of illnesses and symptoms during the previous puerperium are not discussed.
9 T h e reported maternal mortality ratio of 40 per 100,000 live births in Sri Lanka is one of the lowest in the developing world. However, researchers believe that the ratio underestimates the actual level of maternal mortality in Sri Lanka (De Silva, 1997b). This underestimation is due to the intentional misclassification of actual maternal deaths to common gynecological causes

puerperal morbidity. Of the 596 mothers successfully interviewed, 40 per cent reported excessive bleeding during the puerperium, 24 per cent in unprompted responses and 16 per cent in prompted responses (Figure 1). Shivering, breast engorgement, or a painful burning feeling when urinating was also reported by slightly more than one-third of the mothers. Pain in the lower abdomen during puerperium was reported by another onequarter of mothers. In general, about 60 per cent of the mothers who experienced a specific illness during puerperium reported the illness without prompting. A question may arise at this juncture: To what extent do mothers who report an illness without prompting differ demographically or socioeconomically from mothers who report the same with prompting? An analysis found no significant difference between these two groups (results are not shown). Therefore, in the subsequent analysis, the illnesses and symptoms which have been obtained from unprompted and prompted categories are combined and defined as the total prevalence.
All morbidities can be measured along a severity continuum which could be ranged from "nuisance" to "life-threatening." Naturally, some morbidities are immediately life-threatening, although they occur in less severe forms, such as the postpartum hemorrhage (Fortney, 1995). In the present study we were not able to assess whether the reported level of
when the deaths actually resulted from complications of induced abortion. Induced abortion remains illegal in Sri Lanka, but a significantly large number of pregnancies are terminated by trained and untrained personnel using both modern and folk methods (De Silva, 19976). Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, hemorrhage, sepsis, and anemia are the leading causes of the reported maternal deaths in Sri Lanka.

per cent did not stay even one night there. In contrast to the vaginal-delivered mothers, those who underwent caesarean sections spent seven nights on average in the health institution before returning home.
Among the vaginal-delivered mothers a significantly large proportion (46 per cent) reported excessive bleeding during the puerperium. Of those whoreported it, one-quarter felt that it was either "very serious" or "serious" (Table 2). Overonethird of the vaginal-delivered mothers reported either painful burning feeling when urinating, or breast engorgement, or shivering conditions during the puerperium. Mental health status of mothers during the puerperium is also assessed through the change in mental make-up, that is, to identify any level of post-delivery depression. About 6 per cent of vaginal-delivered mothers reported the experience of some degree of change in

mental make-up during the puerperium, and of them over 40 per cent noted the condition as "very serious" or "serious."10
Among women who underwent caesarean section, between 26 to 30 per cent reported either pain in lower abdomen, or painful burning feeling (dysurea) when urinating, or breast engorgement, or backache (Table 3). Importantly, fever during the puerperium is also reported by 12 per cent and 8 per cent of the caesarean-sec-

Only one of them was able to describe her morbid conditions with the assistance of her sister, but the other onewas not. Both of them lost their husbands, who were soldiers fighting against separatists, a few weeks before the interview. One unmarried eligible mother was also identified with severe postdelivery depression who worked as a domestic aid, but the enumerator was able to interview her at the second visit which was made one week following the first visit.

Since health personnel could identify most of the illnesses of mothers during the puerperium, particularly when they are an in-patient at a health institution, and thereby provide appropriate treatment for them, hospitalization might have significantly influenced the reporting of the prevalent illness and also the level of severity of each reported condition. Moreover, caesarean-section-delivered mothers might have felt more secure as they are in the hands of more qualified health professionals at a tertiary-level institution for about a week after the delivery.
Research on maternal morbidity has tended to focus on complications that are measured and potentially life-threatening, but "minor complaints," such as backache, are rarely addressed even though such conditions may significantly impair a woman's well-being and ability to work (Liskin, 1992). A study done in Birmingham, UK, which has investigated this type of problem found that 72 per cent of primigravidae reported backache which lasted over six weeks and which started within three months of delivery (McCarthy and Maine, 1992).
INDEX OF MORBIDITY DURING
PUERPERIUM
How frequently does an illness occur during the puerperium? Eighty-nine per cent of mothers reported one or more illness during the puerperium. Thus, only 11 per cent reported no illness during the same period (Figure 3). Over 50 per cent reported either two or three illnesses. In fact, about 7 per cent reported more than five different illnesses.
Supporting the hypothesis made earlier, mothers delivered by caesarean section tend to report fewer numbers of illnesses during the puerperium than

mothers who had a vaginal delivery (Figure 4). While only 9 per cent of vaginaldelivered mothers reported perfect health (no illness) during the puerperium, almost one-quarter of the caesarean section delivered mothers said the same. Number of illnesses experienced by vaginal-delivered mothers are generally higher than by the caesarean-section-delivered mothers. The vaginal-delivered mothers reported the experience of 2-3 illnesses more frequently during the puerperium while 2 illnesses was the peak among the caesarean.
During the puerperium, many mothers suffered with more than one illness and also with different combinations of illnesses. Some mothers suffered with relatively more important obstetric complications while others with less important complications. For instance, excessive bleeding during the puerperium poses a relatively high risk of dying compared to backache during the same period. As one would expect, for the same illness the reported level of severity varies from mother to mother. Each mother's overall health status during the puerperium varies greatly depending on what type of illness, and symptoms, she has had and how severe it is. As Graham and Campbell (1991) noted, the physical condition in which a woman finds herself as a result of a recent pregnancy and childbirth can be thought of as being part of a continuum in which complete health is at one end of the spectrum and death is at the other, with various degrees of ill health and incapacity between them. Therefore, the index of morbidity is constructed to represent each mother's overall level of morbidity during the puerperium (Table 4).
Instead of examining only one specific illness, say excessive bleeding, suffered during the puerperium, we would find it

"Each mother has received a value to represent her level of morbidity. For instance, a mother who reported fever (serious) and breast engorgement (not serious) received a value of 8 as her index of morbidity (3X2 + 2X1).

more useful to examine a whole spectrum of illnesses and symptoms which represent each mothers' overall health status during this period. Since many women suffered different types of illnesses with different levels of severity, the weights that should be given to specific illnesses became a difficult question to resolve. Therefore, a couple of obstetricians and nursing sisters in the study area were requested to provide their own weights for each illness and symptom reported, as shown in Table 4. After assessing the responses received, we developed a set of weights to represent each illness and symptom, and those values are also shown in Table 4. For instance, fever, excessive bleeding, vaginal discharge with bad smell, pain in lower abdomen, and difficulty in controlling urine, all are grouped into a most important category and each received a value of three. Illnesses and symptoms which are relatively less important are grouped into a least important category, and each was given a value of one. The level of severity

was weighted as three, two, and one, in order to represent the "very serious," "serious," and "not serious" categories respectively.
Each mother, depending on the illnesses and symptoms which she reported and their level of severity, received a single value to represent her level of morbidity during the puerperium. For instance, a mother who reported fever (level = "serious") and breast engorgement (level = "not serious") received a value of eight as her index of morbidity (3X2 + 2X1). Theoretically, the index should range from 0-81 (zero being no illness; 81 being highest morbid condition). However, the observed values of the index ranges from 0-45 only (Figure 5). The observed distribution of the index closely follows a chi-square distribution.
Which illness contributed relatively more to the overall index of the puerperal morbidity? Excessive bleeding made the highest contribution (24 per cent) to the overall value of the index (Figure 6). Pain in lower abdomen, breast engorgement,

and a painful burning feeling when urinating, each contributed 15 per cent of the overall index and thus the burden of ill health among the mothers during the puerperium was largely the result of these illnesses.
DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS
Who are the mothers belonging tothe high morbid category compared with the moderate and lowmorbid categories?Are they different demographically andsocioeconomically? Do they differ in their pregnancies and delivery-related conditions? To answer these questions, we categorize the distribution of the index of morbidity into a few logically appropriate groups.
The categorization of the index was attempted by considering a couple of important points andoptions: categorization of mothers into 3 or 4 equal-size groups by using the distribution of the index (Figure 5); themedian value of 6.0 in the observed distribution; and over 30 per cent of mothers reporting either "very serious" or "serious" illnesses during the puerperium. The final categorization was made by using a trade-off between different options, as shown in Table 5. Mothers were categorized into three groups; low morbid, moderately morbid, and high morbid. Mothers who had received the index values of 0-2 were assigned as low morbid; those who received 9 or more index values, high morbid; andthebalance, moderately morbid. Nearly 20 per cent and 31 percent of mothers were grouped into thelow-morbid andhigh-morbid categories respectively.

less than 25 years, had the highest level of morbidity compared with the others. Significantly, a strong relationship in morbidity was observed when the age difference of spouses was examined. Mothers who are older than their spouses were observed to be more morbid than the mothers whose spouses were in the same age group or younger (Table 6). A relatively larger proportion of mothers who experienced one or more pregnancy wastage were identified in the high-morbid category than of mothers who had not experienced any pregnancy wastage.
Nearly 44 per cent of the mothers in our study population had been identified as primigravidae (last column of Table 6). Since Sri Lanka has already achieved replacement-level fertility," the study population was expected to be comprised of nearly one-half of primigravidae mothers. Mothers with four or more births were found to be only 9 percent. Primigravidae mothers represent a higher level of morbidity during the puerperium than the others.

Sri Lanka is the first country in the South Asia subregion to record such a low level of fertility (De Silva, 1994).

Mothers were also questioned about their fertility desires, making specific reference to the time of last conception leading to the last birth. Mothers who indicated

that they were not expecting any child or wanted to delay their childbearing at that time identified with a relatively high level of morbidity as contrasted with mothers

Vol. 45, No. 3-4

who were happy to conceive and have a child. Mothers who claimed that their last child (or first child) was unwanted could provide some indication of dissatisfaction on their reproductive behavior and that seems to increase morbidity risk during the puerperium (not shown in Table 6).
DELIVERY-RELATED VARIABLES
As reported in Table 6, 70 per cent of the mothers had experienced less than 12 hours of labor while 18 per cent experienced 12 or more hours. A relatively small proportion of mothers reported no labor before the delivery; almost all of these mothers had undergone caesarean section delivery. Mothers who experienced long labor (12 or more hours) clearly demonstrated a higher level of morbidity during the puerperium than the others. Another delivery complication investigated, heavy bleeding during delivery, shows the expected pattern but without any statistical significance (not shown in Table 6).
The mothers who were hospitalized any time during the last pregnancy provide a clue to the level of complications experienced during that time. However, hospitalization was not strongly related to the complications experienced during the puerperium. No clear pattern existed through the three levels of morbidity and hospitalization during pregnancy. Presumably, most of the pregnancy-related critical complications disappeared with the delivery (not shown in Table 6).
In a developing country, delivery practices are expected to influence morbidity during the puerperium. For instance, use of unclean hands to remove the placenta manually may cause infection during the puerperium. Since caesarean-section deliveries are usually performed in a hy-

gienic environment, additional information was obtained only from the vaginaldelivered mothers. We asked whether after the delivery of the child, hands were used to remove the placenta manually. This information for vaginal-delivered mothers is used along with the caesareansection mothers as a composite variable to examine the possible association with morbidity during the puerperium. Among the vaginal-delivered, the use of hands had no association with the level of morbidity. However, it is the caesarean-section-delivered mothers who reported a significantly lower level of puerperal morbidity than both groups of vaginaldelivered mothers.
Facilities and trained staff at a maternity unit could also influence the level of puerperal morbidity. About three-quarters of the total deliveries in the study population took place in a tertiary level institution, including a small proportion of deliveries in private institutions. Home deliveries are remarkably low in Sri Lanka,12 and in the study population only 5 deliveries were reported as such. Mothers who delivered at tertiary level hospitals show a lower morbid condition than the mothers who delivered in any other institution (not shown in Table 6).
A pregnancy outcome variable, the birth weight of child, was also used to examine any possible association between the level of morbidity in the puerperium. Mothers who delivered a large child, say 3000 gm or more, were found to be reporting a higher morbidity rate
12On average, 85 per cent of the total registered births in Sri Lanka occur in government medical institutions, while only 33 per cent of all births in India are attended by trained birth attendants or medical personnel (Grant, 1988).

during the puerperium than mothers who delivered an average-size child or even a low-birth-weight (<2500 gm) child (Table 6).
SOCIOECONOMIC VARIABLES
As expected, among socioeconomic variables selected, mothers who are less educated and who live in rural areas show relatively high morbidity compared to their better-educated and urban counterparts (Table 5). The percentage of household's monthly income spent on food was considered as an income proxy;13 21 per cent of the households in the study population were identified as poor, and mothers of these households in general showed a moderate or high level of morbidity compared to the other mothers. A few more economic indicators such as income, mother's employment status, and type of occupation, have been used in the analysis but demonstrated no significant association with the level of morbidity (not shown in Table 5).
Mother's overall status in the household was assessed by asking a simple question on "Whether she had any say on household's day-to-day expenses?" Mothers who have very little or no say on household expenditure could be categorized as "poor status" and the balance as "better status." Mothers who belong to the "poor status" group showed a higher morbidity level than those who were of "better status." Even though Buddhism
13According to the World Bank study on poverty in Sri Lanka, about 20 per cent of households are identified as living below the poverty level (World Bank, 1995). The study used a couple of socioeconomic parameters, including the percentage of household's average income spent on food, to measure the level of poverty. In the present study, households which spent over 80 per cent of income on food are defined as living in poverty.

provides a better status for women than some other religious groups, in our study population Buddhist mothers had a higher morbidity rate than mothers in other religious groups. Muslim mothers were least affected by ill health during the puerperium (Table 5).
A custom practiced in Sri Lanka, and also observed in many South Asian countries, is for a woman at a later stage of pregnancy to move to her parents' home to stay a few weeks there after the delivery. This practice is common in rural populations and particularly among primigravidae mothers. Mothers who moved to their parents' home indicated a relatively higher level of puerperal morbidity than those who stayed in their own residence (not shown in Table 6), although the association was not statistically significant. There may be other types of causal relationships. Mothers who suffered more ill health during pregnancy and delivery might have been brought to their parents' home for better care. It should be noted that our study population comprises a large proportion of primigravidae, and they usually had a higher level of ill health during the puerperium than the others.
MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS
Even though the association between demographic, socioeconomic, and delivery-related variables and the level of ill health among mothers in the puerperium can be investigated in tabular form, a multivariate analysis can assess the independent effects of one or another variable after controlling for others. As an appropriate multivariate technique to represent our dependent variable, an ordered logit model is selected. It is used to estimate relationships between an ordinal dependent variable

Vol. 45, No. 3-4

Puerperal Morbidity

239

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:48 08 December 2015

and a set of selected independent variables. An ordinal variable is a variable that is categorical and ordered. When the dependent variable is categorical and ordered, logits can directly incorporate the ordering which results in models having simpler interpretations and potentially greater power than ordinary multicategory logit models (McCullagh, 1980; Greenland, 1985).
The dependent variable used in the ordered logit model is categorized as low, moderate, and high morbidity. The effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable is estimated by the odds ratio for each variable category relative to the reference category which has the odds ratio of one. In Model 1, only one set of selected demographic variables were regressed with the dependent (response) variable, and in Model 2, apart from the demographic variables, a set of pregnancy and delivery related variables were added to the model. In the final model, along with all the variables used in Model 2, a set of variables which represent mothers' socioeconomic situation is also added. Most of the relationships we observed in the descriptive analysis remain substantially unchanged, particularly their direction of impact, when they are reassessed in the ordered logit model (Table 7).
It is worthwhile to note that even though a key demographic variable such as age of the mother shows no significant association with the level of puerperal morbidity, it is included in all three models because of its theoretical importance. Younger mothers in all models tend to have higher morbid conditions than others. Only one other variable (mode of delivery and use of hands to remove placenta), even though not significant, was included in the models.

In the final model, age differences between spouses, controlling for all other variables, indicate a significantly strong association with puerperal morbidity. Mothers who are older than their spouses were found to be more highly morbid than the others (Table 7). Among the demographic variables, parity indicates the careful monitoring of health among the primigravidae since they have the highest morbid condition during the puerperium than any other gravidae. The logit model results confirm the importance of identification of mothers who experienced any pregnancy loss since they suffer more heavily during the puerperium than those who had no such experience. Mothers who had long labor had significantly higher morbidity than others. Also mothers who delivered relatively large babies (3000 gm or more) demonstrate higher morbidity than mothers who delivered low-birth-weight children.
Even after controlling for demographic delivery-related variables, we find that a set of socioeconomic variables regressed in the final model show a strong relation with the response variable. As is expected, less-educated mothers or those living in a rural locality tend to report higher morbidity than mothers who are better educated or living in an urban locality, which may be due to cultural practices or to other reasons. Mothers who adhere to Buddhism clearly experienced worse morbidity during the puerperium than Muslim, Hindu, or Roman Catholic mothers.

countries, in spite of the fact that this is the period where the majority of maternal deaths occur. Thus, special efforts are needed to provide useful information to health planners and policy makers so that appropriate strategies can be designed to bring about improved maternal health.
Most studies on maternal morbidity in developing countries, including Sri Lanka,

are based on information collected from health institutions such as clinics or hospitais. They are largely studies of single morbidities (Howard, 1987), because maternal health has always been considered a domain of clinical specialists and not an epidemiological or social issue (Bhatia and Cleland, 1995). However, unlike during the antenatal period, many mothers in

Vol. 45, No. 3-4

the developing world do not visit such facilities for treatment or consultation of their puerperal illnesses or problems. Thus, the results of such studies tell us nothing about incidence or prevalence of conditions at the community level and furthermore can seriously distort the overall picture (Fortney, 1995). With these points in view, the present study on self-reported illnesses and symptoms of puerperal morbidity was undertaken in 1996 in three MOH areas in Kalutara district of Sri Lanka.
This is a prospective study of a cohort of 600 delivered mothers identified through PHM's registers and thus involves no sampling problems and represents in principle an ideal approach for collecting information on maternal health. In the Sri Lankan setting, the organization and implementation of this type of prospective study is relatively convenient because almost all pregnant women are registered by the resident PHM's in their respective areas in Sri Lanka.
Even though the measurement instruments of maternal health at the community level are improving, clearly the prevalence of maternal morbidity needs to be assessed through reports of mothers' experiences in a community setting. Medical professionals may criticize this approach on the grounds that there is no precise correspondence between self-reported symptoms and clinical diagnoses. But it is the recognition of a problem, its perceived causes, and feared outcome rather than a sophisticated medical diagnosis which generally determine how a disease will be managed by the patient (Bhatia and Cleland, 1996). Thus, demand for and utilization of services will depend on subjective perception. Such information is necessary for tailoring health

programs to address women's health needs effectively (El-Mouelhy et al., 1994; Paolisso and Leslie, 1995).
The study has demonstrated that levels of morbidity associated with childbearing among mothers in Sri Lanka is very high. The observed levels are much higher than one would expect in the low maternal mortality setting of Sri Lanka. The observation that 89 per cent of mothers suffer one or more symptoms of ill health during the puerperium suggests that there is an urgent need to strengthen maternal health care immediately following a birth.
Many studies from developing as well as developed countries tend to recognize the high prevalence of ill health during the puerperium. For instance, the crosssectional community-based study conducted in Giza, Egypt, showed that 56 per cent of 508 women examined had demonstrable prolapse (Younis et al., 1993). Another study in Birmingham, UK, of health after childbirth, found that the number of women suffering significantly ill health as a consequence of delivery was as high as 64 per cent (MacArthur et al., 1991). A more recent study done in Bangladesh by the Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (Goodburn et al., 1994) and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine reported that during the two weeks after delivery 92 per cent of mothers suffer some episode of ill health.
In the present study, many morbidities are common. Of the total 596 mothers successfully interviewed, 40 per cent had excessive bleeding. Shivering, breast engorgement, or a painful burning feeling when urinating was reported by almost one-third of mothers. Of the total reported episodes of illness during the puerperium about 30 per cent were noted as either

242

"very serious" or "serious." Of mothers who recognized such serious illnesses, a considerable proportion did not seek professional care for those problems.
Socioeconomic environment or/and knowledge, attitude, and practices during the period of maternity might have influenced mothers to refrain from seeking professional care. Thus, in these situations it may require a different kind of intervention to increase use of services. The study also demonstrates the importance of morbidities given little prominence in medical research and writing, in particular bleeding problems and breast problems. These morbidities were reported by significant number of mothers in the study and thus there is considerable scope for early postpartum care in the detection of these problems.
A higher level of puerperal morbidity was expected following caesarean sections since these mothers have more pregnancy complications than those who had vaginal deliveries. This pattern did not emerge. A week of in-patient care in a sophisticated medical environment with a built-in treatment process seems to have reduced the overall burden of ill health during the puerperium among these mothers as opposed to the vaginal-delivered mothers who returned home after a relatively short period of hospital stay. It is more likely that those women undergoing caesarean section (13 per cent of total deliveries) received appropriate care for most of the complications arising during a one-week stay in major hospitals, regardless of whether or not the mother was informed of such complications (Fortney and Smith, 1996). Moreover, almost all the vaginaldelivered mothers in our study indicated that they did not wish to stay in the hospital longer after delivery because of their

family responsibilities and the lack of good services for them in the hospital.
The multivariate analysis demonstrates a number of associations that are potentially important. Mothers who experienced pregnancy wastage or primigravidae are likely to suffer more than the others. Irrespective of their current age, mothers who are older than their spouses also have a relatively high risk of ill health. The high female age at marriage in Sri Lanka, which now stands at almost 26 years (De Silva, 1997a), demonstrates the relative importance of this issue.
Mothers were more likely to have problems and infections during the puerperium if labor had been prolonged. If labor had been prolonged, the birth attendant might have used her hands also to manipulate the baby, resulting in puerperal infection. Supporting this link, we observed a positive association between the duration of labor and the overall burden of ill health among our study population. Apart from provision of antibiotics, there is a need to improve community awareness of obstetric emergencies and the importance of a referral system.
The study reported only one outcome related to the child, the birthweight, which is readily available to interviewers since almost all births were institutional. The proportion of low-birthweight children in Sri Lanka (18 per cent) reported in the 1993 Demographic and Health Survey (Department of Census and Statistics, 1995) is highly comparable with the estimate of 17 per cent in the present study. However, it was not the low birthweight which seems to influence ill health. More attention should be given to mothers who produced a relatively large child than those who had an averageweight or under-weight child.

Strong association between puerperal morbidity and the socioeconomic status of mothers was identified. Mothers who are less educated or living in a rural locality should receive more attention since they seem to lack the power and resources to maintain their health, particularly during this vulnerable period of time. It is more likely these mothers are less well nourished than those who are educated or living in an urban environment. It may be poor nutrition14 per se, or other factors associated with poor nutrition, that makes mothers vulnerable to ill health, rather than factors associated with socioeconomic status such as quality of housing or household amenities. However, it should be noted that compared with Muslim and also with Hindu/Roman Catholic mothers, the Buddhist mothers report the worst scenario. Presumably, this finding could be related to higher malnutrition among Buddhist mothers than the others and also to cultural practices which may have sapped their strength to fight against illness during the puerperium.
Mothers who are reported to be severely morbid during the puerperium have been identified in the present analysis, and therefore appropriate interventions could be formulated to reduce the burden of ill health among them during

this period. It is well recognized that to reduce maternal mortality and sequelae of morbidities, women must be treated for morbidities that arise. Some of the conditions we observed may not endanger the life of the mother, but if untreated, often result in severe gynecological or reproductive health problems. There is a need to strengthen follow-up services to reach recently delivered mothers and also to develop better strategies to provide emergency care to women in difficult and complicated long labors. It is an appropriate time to look beyond antenatal care and to develop strategies for the promotion of accessible postpartum care through the already well-established MCH system in Sri Lanka.

14Anemia among pregnant and lactating mothers is found to be over 60 per cent in Sri Lanka, and the clinical data of the study area were no different from the national estimates (De Silva, 1993). Many mothers know that they ought to eat vegetables, fruits, fish, meat and drink milk during the pregnancy and lactating period, but whether they can do so or not depends on their household income.
