ABSTRACT: During the 1800's, the population of Ireland underwent a rapid increase and subsequent decrease in population size. The effects of this change upon population structure were assessed using a simulation of the isolation by distance model and comparing the results to those obtained assuming constant population size. These results indicate that changes in within-group genetic similarity (kinship) brought about by a rapid increase in population size are cancelled by the effects of a rapid decrease in population size. Parameters of the isolation by distance model are hardly affected by population size changes. These results suggest that violation of the assumption of constant population size for population structure models may not be that serious when population size changes rapidly and in both directions.

The study of human population structure allows the assessment of the effects of cultural behavior upon gene and genotype distributions in a population. Essentially, a population's structure refers to the mating probabilities of its members, and the subsequent effects on genotype distributions. Factors influencing this structure include mating preferences and/or avoidances, population size and distribution, and barriers to gene flow, which may be geographic, topographic, and social (Yasuda and Morton, 1967; CavalliSforza and Bodmer, 1971).
The basic measure of population structure is the coefficient of kinship, 4>,7, defined by Malecot (1969) as the probability that two random alleles from the same locus, one from individual i and one from individual;, are identical due to descent from one or more common ancestors. The coefficient of kinship is a generalization of Wright's inbreeding coefficient (F), where i and; are mates. Kinship as defined here can be estimated from a wide variety of

data, such as pedigrees, gene frequencies, surnames, migration matrices, and metrics (Morton et al., 1971;Morton, 19736), for either individuals or samples.
A commonly used model of human population structure is isolation by distance, which proceeds from the basic assumption.that most people choose mates from nearby and fewer choose mates from further away. This model describes kinship (c)>)as a negative exponential function of the geographic distance between populations (d), such that

(Yasuda and Morton, 1967), where a and b are known as the Malecot parameters. The parameter a is an estimate of the mean within-group kinship (4>,,), and b is a measure of the rate of decrease in kinship with distance. The parameter b reflects the balance between short range gene flow and linear systematic forces acting upon the entire array of populations. It is gener-

While the Famine was not the first occurrence of the potato blight in Ireland, it was the most devastating in that it occurred for five consecutive years during which time the Irish received little aid from their English landlords. Approximately one million people emigrated and over one and a half million died (Woodham-Smith, 1962). The Famine was not, however, the sole cause of population decline. Population growth was already decreasing prior to the

The data used in these studies consist of 14 anthropometric measures taken on adult males and adult females from 12 towns in Western Ireland between 1934 and 1936 and are a subset of the material originally collected by the Harvard Anthropological Survey of Ireland (Hooton and Dupertuis, 1955). Since the studies cited above have shown the female sample to provide a better fit to the isolation by distance model, that sample will be used here for the derivation of the simulation parameters.

tances, is appropriate even when actual migration is multidimensional (Imaizumi et al., 1970; Morton, et al., 1973). In the present study, twenty populations arranged in a circular structure were chosen for simulation.
For a one-dimensional model, such as described above, the Malecot parameters is expressed in terms of the effective population size, Ne, and the effective migration rate, mt, that is,

a = 1/(1 + 4NmJ,

(2)

where the effective migration rate is composed of the stepping-stone migration rate between adjacent populations, k, and long-range migration from outside the region of analysis is acting upon the entire array of populations, m. This relationship
is

m,= (3)

A final parameter of the one-dimensional stepping-stone model is the distance D between any two adjacent populations, which is

D = (4)
where b is the Malecot parameter (Morton, 1973a). The decomposition of the Malecot parameters into these components (k, m, D) allows simulation of an ideal referent population. While effective population size and effective migration are used to estimate kinship, they are generally less than the evolutionary population size and migration rate, which depend on local migration (Morton, 1973c).
For the present study, I obtained values of Nt and m from demographic data and used these along with the isolation-bydistance parameters to estimate steppingstone migration as

k = {[(1 - a)/4dN£ - m2}/2m, (5)
and stepping-stone distance (D) was computed from Equation (4). For each town, the effective population size was computed using Crow and Kimura's (1970) formula, which takes into account variance in fertility. The value of Ne for simulation was taken as the harmonic mean of these values (Relethford, 19806). An estimate of m was obtained from the proportion of immigrants into the area of study based on census data. Details of this estimation may be found in Relethford (19806). These procedures resulted in estimates of Nt = 262 and m = 0.041. Use of Equations (4) and (5) gave estimates of A; = 0.164 and D = 23 km. These estimates are similar to those obtained in other studies of human population structure, especially Swiss Alpine isolates (Morton, 1977).
Simulation of the isolation by distance model is accomplished using an iterative process which computes the expected kinship between two populations based on the effective population size, Nt, the rate of long-range migration, m, the number of generations, t, and the exchange matrix of local stepping-stone migration, P. The elements of the exchange matrix are computed from the stepping-stone migration rate k, such that

Pu = l-k,

(6)

P.. = kl2 for adjacent populations,

Ptj = 0 for non-adjacent populations.

For simulation of an ideal circular structure, the exchange matrix is symmetric (P.. = P.) (Imaizumi et al., 1970; Morton* 1973c). In the present study, each population exchanges k/2 = 16.4/2 = 8.2 per cent of its genes with both adjacent neighbors.
The kinship between populations i and

/ at generation t is computed using the recurrence formula
(7)
(5)where summation is over all n populations (Imaizumi et al., 1970). If all of the parameters remain constant through time, the average within-group kinship («}>..) will increase asymptotically to approach equilibrium. Other variants of simulation of a migration matrix may be found in Bodmer and Cavalli-Sforza (1968), Hiorns et al. (1969), and Smith (1969).
When the values of Nt, m, and k are held constant, the above model allows comparison with observed values of kinship to determine if the reduction to a circular stepping-stone model is appropriate (Morton et al., 1973). Also, this model provides a reference with which to assess the effects of changing population size. These effects were assessed in the present study by changing the value oiNe at each generation in proportion to the change in population size in Ireland between 1687 and 1936. Values of Nt were obtained by using the rates of growth for pre- and postFamine growth from Figure 1 and extrapolating back from an effective population size of 262 in 1936 (Relethford, 19806). This method assumes that changes in population size were proportional throughout Ireland. Based on limited data by counties (Department of Industry and Commerce, 1938), such an assumption seems reasonable.
To relate the simulation model to actual dates, average generation length must be known. A generation length of 25 years was taken as an approximate average of age at marriage prior to and after-the

Famine (Connell, 1950; Kennedy, 1973). Using generations of 25 years each, a maximum effective population size of 689 was predicted for 1836 and a minimum of 165 for 1661.1 chose 50 generations as the total duration for simulation. By letting the last generation occur in 1936,1 found the maximum population size was reached in the 46th generation and the minimum in the 39th generation. Generations 1 through 38 were assumed to have a constant effective population size of 165. While constancy in population size prior to 1661 (Generation 39) seems a reasonable assumption in light of Ireland's demographic history, the effects of choosing shorter simulation durations will be addressed below.
In addition to a consideration of the effect of changing population size on withingroup kinship, the effects on estimates of the Malecot parameters were also assessed. At each generation, the isolation by distance parameters were estimated using a logarithmic transformation of Equation (1), such that

\n = \n(a) - bd,

(8)

where the geographic distance d is taken as the perimeter distance in kilometers around the circular exchange network. Given/) = 23 km. above, populations are separated at d = 23 km., 46 km., 69 km., and so forth.

RESULTS
The changes in mean within-group kinship with time are shown in Figure 2, where Run 1 assumes constant effective population size and Run 2 assumes changing population size. Run 1 shows the typical asymptotic curve with a rapid increase in within-group kinship, which then decelerates to slowly converge on an equilib-

often obtained in any one study using different methods of bioassay. In sum, the effects of a rapid increase and subsequent decrease in population size are small, which suggests that kinship estimated under the assumption of constant population size provides a slight overestimate of actual kinship. The degree of this overestimation depends upon what point in time the simulation begins.
The estimates of the Malecot parameter b for the 11 generation run behave in the same manner as the 50 generation run, giving similar values for Run 1 (b = 0.0606) and Run 2 (b = 0.0580). While these values are similar, they both overestimate the expected value of b at equilibrium (b = 0.0308). Thus, while changing population size has little effect on the estimation of b, the point in time at which simulation begins does affect this estimate. A high value of b in any actual study of population structure might reflect the fact that insufficient time has elapsed rather than a high degree of actual isolation.
The results and conclusions presented above are based on an extremely simple simulation model where only one parameter is altered. In theory, other parameters, such as changing migration rates, generation lengths, and age-sex distributions, could be incorporated. For western Ireland, these data are not available to allow direct incorporation, although general trends can be noted and used with the present study to allow certain inferences to be made. For example, the ethnographic literature suggests increased migration among communities to have occurred due to improvements in transportation and the effect of emigra-

tion reducing the number of available mates within a given region (Connell, 1962). In terms of population structure, this change would correspond with an increase in the stepping-stone migration rate (k) with time. Such a change would act to inflate the increase and decrease of within-group kinship shown in Figure 2. Such a change would also apply to an increase in the long-range migration rate (m) with time. Actual data are needed to adequately describe the evolution of population structure for any specific area. As noted earlier, this study is not an attempt to replicate the actual genetic structure of western Ireland, but rather to assess what types of changes could occur.
In general, the assumption of constant population size appears to be the most critical assumption made for the isolation by distance model. In terms of the present study, dramatic changes in population size have little effect on the final observed parameters of population structure when such change is rapid and in both directions. Additional research is needed to assess the effects of other patterns of population size change which have been observed for human populations.
