ABSTRACT: Interviews were held with a stratified random sample of heads of households (and/ or their spouses) in metropolitan Madras to obtain information on social class identification, height and weight of self and spouse, and other socioeconomic characteristics of the household and of the parents. Social class is found to be weakly but positively correlated with height and ponderal index and is found to be moderately but positively correlated with weight, with age held constant. The social class differences are related to variations among them in ethnic and biological inheritance, the wholesomeness of the household (nutrition, sanitation, and health care), and the value placed on kinds of foodstuffs.

10 to 18 years (Schutte 1980). On the other hand, a study in Sweden finds the correlation between parents' income and the height and weight of children to be virtually nil, but does find a strong positive correlation between father's occupation and the size of these children (Tanner 1962, p. 140). The opinion of most researchers is that childhood differences persist into adulthood. Tanner (1962, p. 96, 97) cites three studies which follow children to adulthood and find differences in physique still persisting and cites nine studies which show that "early maturers are not only people whose growth to maturity is advanced at all ages; they are also people who as adults have more weight-for-height than late maturers." On the other hand, a study in Philadelphia (the Fels data), while not providing information on adult weight, finds that as adults early maturers are not taller than late maturers (Tanner 1962, p. 101).
Studies of adults usually find a positive correlation between social class and height and weight. This correlation holds for Scotland and other places, studied more than two decades ago, but in some instances "the higher classes [although taller and heavier] have less weight for height than the lower ones and are therefore more linear, or ectomorphic" (Tanner 1962, p. 140). A recent study of Italian migrants to Belgium provides a mixed picture of how two aspects of socioeconomic status-- education and occupation--are related to adult body size. While education correlates significantly and positively with height and weight, occupation correlates significantly and positively with only height (Susanne, 1979, p. 350). This correlation between education and size also appears in a study of a very homogeneous population--all males of

Belgian origin, aged 19 to 26 years, who were liable to military service in 1958, 1969, and 1970 (N= 103, 501). In this study, while level of schooling, father's occupation, age, birth order, and number of siblings are all correlated with height and weight, partial correlations reveal education to be the strongest single correlate (Susanne, 1980, p. 703). The most precisely stated measurement of how height is related to three socioeconomic variables--habitation, occupational-educational status of the father, and number of siblings--is found in a study of 12,711 Polish conscripts born in 1957 and examined in 1976. It findsthat mean height decreases monotonically with decreasing degree of urbanization, decreasing occupationaleducational status of the father, and increasing sibship size. Of these factors, occupational-educational status of the father has the strongest effect on height, and all three factors combined account for only 6.5 per cent of the total variation of body height (Bielicki et al. 1981, pp. 545,548).
The reasons why social class, or socioeconomic status, correlates with the height and weight of children and adults have yet to be established with any degree of precision. In the opinion of Tanner (1962, p. 140), "The causes of the socio-economic differential are probably multiple. . . . Nutrition is almost certainly one, and with it all the habits of regular meals, sleep, exercise and general organization that distinguish, from this point of view, a good home from a bad one." While nutrition is the factor most often linked by researchers to variations in human size, its influence has usually been measured in an indirect rather than a direct way. Since the pioneering study of Boas in 1911, over a dozen researchers have compared the

and stature has given rise to studies of assortative mating but in a manner much too limited to demonstrate all aspects of condition one, above. Such studies have sought merely to determine whether or not height influences spousal selection. An assessment of several studies concludes: "The results of homogamy for stature have been inconsistent. However, these studies basically confirmed the earlier studies by Galton and Pearson in which homogamy for stature was found, but it differed by socioeconomic groups. The importance of stature in mate selection depends on the bases for the marriage contract" (Bennett et al., 1975, pp. 172,173). A more recent and greatly extended study compares the parents of black and white children in terms of assortative mating for stature, weight, and the ponderal and Quetelet indices and finds assortative mating to be more prevalent among white than among black parents. In this study the whites are mainly middle class, and the blacks are primarily lower class, according to the estimates of the researches (Mueller and Malina, 1976, p. 296).
The second condition where social class differences in height or weight could be attributed to the genetic component, i.e., when social classes are segregated on the basis of ethnic/racial groups, has not been carefully studied either. However, there are studies which combine social class and ethnicity/race as a factor but mention only one of the two components when analyzing how the combination correlates with height or weight. The researcher sometimes recognizes that the correlation obtained is due to the neglected component, as when Mueller and Malina (1976, p. 274) say that the different degrees of assortative mating

for stature in blacks and whites may reflect differences in the economic class of blacks and whites. More typically, the possible contribution of the neglected component is not recognized, and the researcher expresses surprise or, more strongly, puzzlement about the obtained correlation. The result is illustrated by some studies cited in Tanner (1962, p. 107). Ito's 1942study of women at a Los Angeles college notes the absence of an expected correlation between maturation (as measured by the age of menarche) and the nutritional and economic status of five ethnic/racial groups (Blacks, Chinese, Japanese, Mexicans, and whites or Europeans); and Kraus's 1954 comparison of NativeAmericans with Whites and Roberts' 1960 comparison of Nilotic Blacks with Whites, both resident in the Sudan, unexpectedly find Whites to be less in height and weight while enjoying more favorable economic circumstances and presumably, better nutrition. Of course, the failure to account for the possible contribution of the neglected component will sometimes result in the expected conclusion. This fact is illustrated by two recent studies which find the secular trend in growth of MexicanAmericans to be about one-third less than the rates for Whites (USA and Europe) and attribute this lower rate to the "matrix of lower socio-economic conditions, poorer health conditions, and the marginal nutritional status of Mexican Americans" (Malina and Zavaleta 1980, p. 453; Zavaleta and Malina 1982).
There remains, then, the need to ascertain the relative contributions of genetical and nutritional and other environmental factors to social class variations in body size. In the words of Tanner (1962, p. 120), "Obviously the height of an actual child . . . represents

Vol. 30, No. 2

the resultant of both genetical and environmental forces, together with their interaction, which may be of multiplicative kind. . . . It is exceedingly difficult at present to specify quantitatively the relative importance of each factor." Tanner (1962, p. 121) goes on to remark on the study of Quade in 1956 which attempts to disentangle the relative importance of parents' income and parents' height on height of Copenhagen schoolchildren:
He showed the partial correlation of children's height on parents' height for given income was greater than that on parents' income for given parents' height, thought this latter was statistically significant. Somewhat arbitrary estimates of the relative correlations were 0.3 for heights within income groups and 0.1 for child's height and parental income within parental height groups.
However, parents' height and income are themselves positively correlated (0.13). Similarly, Frisancho and associates examine the relationships between the physique and nutritional status of mothers and the prenatal growth of their neonates. After classifying these 4,952 Peruvian mothers into age-specific percentiles, they find that: maternal height correlates with prenatal growth"; "differences in maternal stature appear to have minimal influence on birth weight and recumbent length where maternal protein and calorie reserves are held constant"; and variations in maternal protein reserves (muscles) are more correlated, and in a positive fashion, with linear growth than are variations in calorie reserves (fat) (Frisancho et al. 1977, pp. 264,273).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The relationship of social class, or socioeconomic status, to human growth

and physical size in India has been studied occasionally, and the findings are similar to those of studies done elsewhere. There is a positive correlation between social class and the birth weight of the newborn (Mukherjee and Biswas, 1959, p. 395) and the early age of maturation of girls, as indicated by the onset of menarche (Israel, 1959, p. 314). In two other studies, social class is not measured but is said or implied to bear on the findings. A recent study of male college students finds those resident in the urban area to be taller and heavier than their counterparts in the rural area (Bandyopadhyay and Chattopadhyay, 1981, p. 120, 121). Women and their progeny residing in London after migrating from the Punjab are found to be taller and heavier than their counterparts still resident in a specific district of the Punjab, with age held constant (Keil etal., 1980, p. 424-28.)
Our study is intended to extend research on social class and height and weight in India and elsewhere. It compares social classes resident in a large urban area, metropolitan Madras, in terms of height, weight, and ponderal index. Men and women are separately compared with age controlled because there is evidence of changing physical size with increasing age.1
1Studies of the effect of aging on stature and weight do not reach identical conclusions. Anthropometric measurements of adults in Ireland reveal that stature for men increases until about age 30 and then decreases. Stature for women begins to decrease slightly before age 30, but the trend isless regular than it is for men. These findings and those of other published reports do not agree, say the researchers: "while several studies have shown aging effects to be more pronounced for males . . . others have shown females to be more responsive to the aging process" (Relethford and Lees, 1981, 81, 82, 85). A study of adult stature in Colombia, which uses age categories different from those used in the Ireland study, says that after correcting for the secular change in adult stature, "the esti-

Attention is also given to the possible influence of genetic and environmental factors on correlations between social class and physical size, but unfortunately the nature of our data does not permit the kind of systematic analysis this topic requires. We noted above two conditions under which it might be argued that the class-physical size correlation could be attributed to genetic factors. One condition is the instance where marriages tend to be endogamous within class and where persons tend to "inherit" and maintain the class which their parents had. The other condition is where social classes differ in the ethnic/racial groups which comprise them. The social classes in our study will be examined with respect to the prevalence of both of these conditions.
As a way of ascertaining the influence of environmental factors on the social class-physical size correlation, we shall examine the social classes in terms of the prevalence of infant and child mortality, a measure which is sometimes said to be the most sensitive index to the nutritional status, sanitary conditions, and health care available to households. Further, in the absence of specific information on the calorie intakes of our social classes, we shall offer some speculations as to how dietary differences may be affecting the physical size.
Data for this study are derived from a larger study of social class.2 Interviews
mated rate of loss in stature due to agingperse for men was0.12cm/yr. while for women it was 0.03 cm/yr." (Himes and Mueller 1977,p. 275). In a study of Czechoslovakia, weight and height are found to decrease with aging. For men, height decreases slightly from age 30 onwards, and weight rises to age 40 and then decreases from age 40to 49; for women, the changes are similar (Petrásek et al., 1979,pp. 131-132).

were held with a stratified random sample of the heads of households (or their spouses) for persons resident in 1966 in metropolitan Madras. Each respondent (i.e., interviewee) was asked to give information on: his or her own assessment of the social class identification of the household; various other socioeconomic attributes of the household; and on the age, height, and weight of self and spouse.
By their identifications, we were able to classify the households into three, broad social classes: lower class, middle class, and upper class (for further details on this classification, see Driver, 1981, p. 32). While these classes are based on self-assessments of social position, they do correlate, quite strongly, with such objective indicators of social position as: man's occupation, woman's occupation, man's earnings, woman's earnings, man's education, woman's education, and home ownership. The strength of the relationship between social class and these various indicators is shown by coefficients of contingency which range from 0.369 to 0.750, having a p-value less than 0.05 in one instance, and pvalues less than 0.001 in all other instances.
Respondents were asked to state the age, height, and weight for spouse and self, as precisely as possible, and to do so in their primary language. Where necessary, we translated terms into English and converted metric measures into inches and pounds. While our figures for height and weight are based on the reports of our respondents rather than on
know one ormore bits of information: own height, own weight, spouse's height, spouse's weight. This information could not be given by about the same proportion of each social class, and thus themissing information does not alter the initial distribution of persons bysocial class.

measurements taken by us, we believe the figures to be accurate because our respondents are almost all literate and able to count, and because studies by other investigators find a very high correlation between reported and measured height and weight.3
RESULTS
Our findings for metropolitan Madras are as follows: Men range in height from 53inches to 76 inches, with the median being 66.4 inches; women (i.e. wives) range in height from 48 inches to
3A study of the measured statures for one hundred husband-wife pairs and the reports of such stature given by wives finds that "correlations between reported and measured statures are high (0.84-0:97) and wives tend to over-estimate their own measured stature by about 1 cm, and that of their husbands by about 1.3 cm." (Himes and Roche, 1982, p. 335). Another study of 25 men and 25 women says: "Pearson product-moment coefficients indicated that there were significant correlations (p < 0.001) between subjects' selfreported and measured heights (r = 0.96 and 0.99 for females and males, respectively) and weights (r=0.89 and 0.99 for females and males, respectively)" (Lass et al., 1982). The findings of these two studies are in general agreement with earlier studies done in the United States, Australia, and Czechoslovakia (Himes and Roche 1982, p. 336; Lass et al., 1982).

70 inches, with the median being 62.5 inches. By social class, median heights (in inches) for men are: 65.7 for the lower class; 66.4 for the middle class; and 67.1for the upper class. The median heights for women are: respectively, 62.3, 62.5, and 62.9. While social class and height are slightly correlated, the correlation is not statistically significant for either men or women (Table 1).
Men range in weight from 85 pounds to 240 pounds, the median being 127 pounds. The median for old men (i.e., persons more than 40 years old) is higher than that for young men, 130 pounds versus 126pounds, which is contrary to the tendency in some other nations of Asia where weight is less at older age (Frisch and Revelle 1967, pp. 27, 28). Social class is clearly related to weight variations among men. For young men, the median weight (in pounds) is 118 for the lower class, 128 for the middle class, and 140 for the upper class; for old men, the medians are, respectively, 116, 129, and 147. The strength of such relationships are indicated by the following Chi-squares and coefficients of contingency: for young

C = 0.482; for old men, *2 = 36.64 (df=18,p < 0.01) and C=0.399.
Women range in weight from 60 pounds to 200pounds, the median being 105 pounds. The median for old women (i.e., persons more than 40 years old) is higher than that for young women, 108 pounds versus 103 pounds. As with men, social class is clearly correlated with the weight of women (Figure 1). For young women, the median is 101 for the lower class, 103 for the middle class, and 108 for the upper class; for old women, the medians are, respectively, 103,109, and 122. The strength and statistical significance of these relationships are indicated by the following chisquares and coefficients of contingency: for young women, x*= 17.39 (df = 12, p > 0.05), and C=0.309; and for old women, ^ = 37.50 (df=18, p < 0.01), and C=0.393. Thus, while the relationships are positive, only in the case of old women is the relationship of statistical significance (i.e., unlikely to be the result of simply sample size and sampling variability).
Next, we compare our respondents in terms of general physique, or the ratio of height to weight. Our calculation of this ratio is based on the use of the ponderal index. This index is based on the following formula: PI = height (inches)/ $ weight (lb.) (Edwards 1978, p.

425). "This index [is] often regarded as the most useful single indicator of bodybuild (particularly in pointing up the extent of linearity)" (Glueck and Glueck 1950, p. 189). The lower this index, the more robust the physique; the higher this index, the more linear the physique. For our respondents, this index ranges from 10.77 to 15.86 for men and from 10.26 to 15.33 for women. These extremes are obtained from persons having the following relationships of height and weight: for men, 63 inches and 200 lbs. (index of 10.77) and 76 inches and 110 lbs. (index of 15.86); for women, 60 inches and 200 lbs. (index of 10.26) and 60 inches and 60 lbs. (index of 15.33). The median indexes for men and women, respectively, are 12.99 and 12.84. Thus, while the ranges and medians for the indexes for men and women are similar, men and women are different from each other in their absolute (but not proportional) height and weight (as our extreme cases for the genders serve to illustrate).
Social class and robust physique are weakly correlated in a positive direction: the higher the class, the more robust the physique. For men, the median index is 13.19 for the lower class, 12.98 for the middle class, and 12.77 for the upper class. For women, these indexes are, respectively, 12.94, 12.81, and

12.74. The coefficients of contingency are 0.1993 for women and 0.1396 for men; in the latter instance, this coefficientis both weak and not statistically significant (Table 2).
With respect to height, weight, and the ponderal index, social classes are distinguished only by weight, with age held constant. This difference, which is only moderate in its prevalence, may be due to genetic factors and/or environmental factors which characterize the social classes to greater or less degree. As we noted above, the genetic factor's possible influence may be explored by ascertaining whether marriages are endogamous within class and there is continuity between the social class of parents and our respondents and/or whether the social classes differ in their ethnic/racial composition. The influence of the environmental factor is explored by comparing the social classes in terms of infant and child mortality, which is believed to reflect the household condition with respect to nutrition, sanita-

tion, and health care. Our data on these
matters suggest that genetical and envi-
ronmental influences may be affecting
weight differences.
The genetical influence is suggested
by the following observations. The mar-
riage contracts, almost all of which in-
volved the participation of parents of
the respondents, ensure a high degree of endogamy within social class.4 While we
4Such contracts may also ensure considerable endogamy within the kin-group. In South India, there is still a preference for marriages between a woman and either her mother's brother or acrosscousin (Fa Si Son or Mo Bro Son). While we do not know how often the parents of our respondents were kin before marriage and do thereby transmit to our respondents familial tendencies of height and weight, we suspect that they often were kin. This belief is based on our data concerning the extent to which our respondents and their spouses were kin before marriage. Of our total respondents, 38 per cent were kin-related before marriage; there is little difference between the social classes, with age constant. Over two-thirds of the kin-related marriages were of the preferred types mentioned above.
Similar findings for another district of Tail Nadu are reported by Rao and Inbaraj (1977, pp. 282-286).

do not have information on the class identifications of parents, we do have information on their educational and occupational statuses which shows that the correlations (coefficient of contingency) between the fathers of our male respondents and the fathers of their spouses are 0.630 (p = < 0.001) for education and 0.710 (p = < 0.001) for occupation. Continuity between the social class of parents and that of our respondents is suggested by the correlations (coefficient of contingency) between the education and occupation of the fathers and the social class of respondents. The values for education are 0.536 (p = < 0.001) for male respondents and 0.454 for female respondents (p = < 0.001); the values for occupation are 0.456 for male respondents and 0.465 for female respondents. These correlations are only moderately strong. They and the correlation for endogamy do permit us to mildly argue that the moderate correlation between the social class and weight of our respondents is due to our respondents being descended from persons of similar class and presumably similar physical type. Of course, we do not know whether the correlation between social class and weight for parents actually existed, but for the purpose of our argument we have made such an assumption. It is possible that some part of the moderate correlation for our respondents reflects social mobility (comparing respondents with their parents in terms of social class) of physical types in a nonrandom manner.
The genetical influence on the correlation between social class and weight is only slightly suggested by the ways in which the social classes are differentiated in ethnic (caste and tribal/racial) composition. Our respondents belong to 53 castes (or /art's) and the social

classes are quite unevenly comprised of these ethnic groups. When these castes are grouped into three broad categories (Brahman, Non-Brahman, and Scheduled Castes), the upper class is found to be comprised of 39 per cent Brahman but only 7 per cent Scheduled Castes, while the lower class is found to be comprised of zero per cent Brahman but 68 per cent--Scheduled Castes. The general correlation (coefficient of contingency) between social class and ethnic composition is 0.418 (p = < 0.001). While this correlation is only moderately strong, it may be noted that castes are usually found to be genetically distinguished from one another (Naidu and Veeraju, 1982; Papiha et al., 1980; Sanghvi, 1966).
The moderate correlation between social class and weight may also be due to the influence of environmental factors. Using the infant and child mortality prevalence as an indicator of the nutritional status, sanitation, and health care available to households, we find social class to be directly correlated with the wholesomeness of the household. With duration of marriage standardized, the per cent of children ever born who have died is 9 for the upper class,22 for the middle class, and 30 for the lower class (Driver, 1981,p. 38).
We suspect that there are environmental, i.e., cultural, factors beyond nutritional level, sanitation, and health care, which contribute to social class and general variations in physical size.5 We note the wide variations within each social class, and the overlap among the social classes, in physical size. Such varia-

upper class; and 33.0 per cent versus 17.3 per cent for all pairs. Given the detailed analyses shown in Table 3 and the small number of respondents in each social class, we did not think it meaningful to calculate more precise statistical indicators of how physiques in each social class are correlated. Such calculations are done for the entire set of persons, and these suggest that there is a moderate tendency for persons of the same

physique to share the same household, and, presumably, to share the same values regarding foodstuffs. In this instance the coefficient of contingency is 0.4112 (p = < 0.001).
SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION For nearly a century, a positive correlation between social and physical size

has been found to occur in the several nations where studies have been done. India is not an exception to this pattern. In metropolitan Madras, social class correlates with height, weight, and physique. These correlations occur for both men and women, and for young and old persons in each gender category. The correlations of social class with body size at maturity may be accounted for in part by their differences in ethnic composition and inheritance of different bone structure and other physical attributes. The class differences, especially with respect to body weight, are also due to variations in nutritional level, sanitation, and health care in the households. Beyond this, variations in the positions which foodstuffs have in the value hierarchy of persons may account for some interclass as well as intraclass variation in physical size.
There is another factor which might contribute to class variations in physical size. It may be that social class correlates with length of residence in large cities, where it appears from studies done by the India Council of Medical Research--that better nutrition exists than in other places (Frisch and Revelle 1967, p. 16). Such long residence might give an advantage in terms of growth spurt, and this might be reflected in adult size. Analyses of the origins and residential patterns of our respondents show that just about half of each social class, within gender and age categories, were born in and have spent most of their lives in metropolitan Madras or

other large, urban places (100,000 + population).
It should be stressed that our findings pertain only to metropolitan Madras. Although there are other studies of height and weight in India, they are not comparable to ours, either because they do not pertain to adults and do not consider social class (Frisch and Revelle, 1969) or because they pertain to adults, but usually omit men as well as social class. The latter type of study is presented along with some of our findings in Table 4. This comparison suggests that women of Indie origin differ considerably in height and weight according to place of residence. Such variation in weight among young persons, both female and male, is also found when comparing those resident in urban and rural areas or comparing those resident in such great cities as Hyderabad, Madras, and other places over 100,000 population (Frisch and Revelle, 1969, pp. 201, 202).
Table 4 indicates the need for many more definitive studies of social class and physical size in India. The very tight design and kinds of information which are needed to explore in depth, and with great care, the relations of social class to stature and weight necessitate resources and multiple specialists, (e.g., physical anthropologists, nutritionists, sociologists) which are far beyond our management. Our paper must remain a modest but, we believe, important contribution to a topic which bears on the well being of many groups.
