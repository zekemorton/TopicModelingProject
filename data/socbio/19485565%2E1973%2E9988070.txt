Although meiotic nondisjunction, resulting in offspring with numerical chromosomal abnormalities, occurs without satisfactory explanation, accumulating evidence suggests the influence of several different factors. Perhaps more positive and less negative evidence implicates maternal autoimmune disease, specifically of the thyroid, than exists for the other possibilities (Fialkow et al., 1971). The role of irradiation is controversial, there being data supporting (Sigler et al., 1965; Uchida et al., 1968) and denying its effect (Carter et al., 1961; Schull and Neel, 1962). The incidence of one specific viral disease, infectious hepatitis, has been related to the occurrence of the d-trisomy1 syndrome in Australia (Stoller and Collmann, 1965; Collmann et al., 1966), but studies in England (Leek, 1966), the United States (Stark and Mantel, 1967), and Canada (Baird and Miller, 1968) were not confirmative, and the role of this specific virus remains speculative. Though an association of maternal age with the G-trisomy syndrome has long been recognized, a testable explanation relating sexual behavior to

delayed fertilization was only recently proposed (German, 1968). Subsequent analyses favored (Shokeir, 1968) and disputed (Penrose and Berg, 1968; Cannings and Cannings, 1968) this hypothesis.
We summarize our understanding of the etiology of meiotic nondisjunction as follows. First, no single factor, regardless of its importance, appears universally contributory. Second, no visible cause operates even in a majority of cases. Third, no mechanism seems to be absolutely causative in any particular case, excluding the families with an inherited translocation. Rather, it seems now that meiotic nondisjunction results from a combination of factors, each possibly exerting a variable influence from one person to the next. Essentially, given a particular genotype and either sex at a certain age, meiotic nondisjunction results because of the accumulation of variable environmental agencies. The problem in predicting this event is that we cannot currently recognize in whom, at what time, and in which circumstances it will occur. Ultimately, of course, prediction is the object of our understanding.

Before conceiving the studies we will describe, we postulated the existence of living patterns due to socioeconomic or educational similarities of families which might lead to the recognition of other causative factors in meiotic nondisjunction. The purpose of our report is to present the results of a survey of some socioeconomic and educational characteristics as well as various measures of reproductive performance in the parents of 80 patients with the G-trisomy syndrome.
MATERIALS
We ascertained the patients from three sources: first, from our Cytogenetics Laboratory in the West Virginia University Hospital between 1 July 1965 and 30 December 1968; second, from the clinics of West Virginia University Hospital between its opening in 1961 and the establishment of the Cytogenetics Laboratory, after which all patients suspected of the diagnosis were referred to it;2 third, from a state institution, specifically, the Colin Anderson Center, St. Marys, West Virginia, where, after obtaining a list of all patients with the diagnosis of Gi-trisomy syndrome, we examined them individually (and also cytogenetically evaluated those in whom we had some reason to question the diagnosis).
All patients survived the neonatal period. The mean age of the 39 males alive at the time of our study was 11.50 years with a range of 2.14 to 35.14 years, and the mean age of the 38 living females was 9.64 years with a range of 0.38 to 31.73 years. The three deceased patients were a male who died at 0.10 years, a male who died at 0.48 years, and a female who died at 0.10 years. The year of birth of the patients ranged from 1933 to 1968, with
2 Assuming reliability of the diagnosis, we used deceased as well as living patients from both these sources.

a mean of 1958, median of 1960, and modes of 1962 and 1963. All patients were Caucasian.
METHODS
After designing the questionnaire, we included it with a letter of introduction and explanation to the parents at their most recent address, except for the last three patients who were ascertained in the Cytogenetics Laboratory and for whom the questionnaire was completed at the time of referral. The questionnaire purposefully asked for more answers than we intended to analyze. We included several questions about growth and development of the G-trisomic and about the environment, because we wished to avoid focusing the respondents' attention to our specific concerns. When necessary to verify a diagnosis in a relative, we wrote supplemental inquiries, particularly to confirm the occurrence of leukemia among the ancestors of G-trisomics.
From the clinical records of West Virginia University Hospital and from the records of its Cytogenetics Laboratory we began with 60 patients. We were unable to contact the parents of 2, we received no response from the parents of 7, and the parents of 1 refused to cooperate, so that 50 of the total of 80 patients came from these sources. We began at the Colin Anderson Center with the names of 48 patients. We could not contact the parents of 5, we received no response to our inquiry from 9, and we had 1 incomplete response. In addition, we eliminated 3 patients who were incorrectly diagnosed. We dismissed 1 of them by physical examination and the other 2 by cytogenetic evaluation, 1 having a normal karyotype and the other mosaicism, 46,XX/47,XX, -{-G. Thus, 30 of the 80 patients came from this source. By eliminating those parents we could not contact, presumably

406

because of incorrect address, and also subtracting the patients whom we showed not to have the syndrome, we estimated the response to be 82%, or 80 out of 98.
We found either the parents, surviving or divorced parent, or closest relative of 71 of the 80 patients at addresses in West Virginia, specifically, in 27 of the state's 55 counties, a majority residing in northwestern and central western counties. The respondents for seven of the remaining nine patients lived in the neighboring states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia; two had relocated to Texas and the Virgin Islands.
We confirmed the diagnosis cytogenetically in 35 of the 80 patients. Excepting 1 patient with the karyotype of 46,XY,-D, + t ( D q G q ) , all patients had 47 chromosomes; none revealed evidence of mosaicism.
RESULTS
REPRODUCTIVE PERFORMANCE
The 80 couples reported a total of 361 pregnancies with a range of 1 to 14 per couple; the mean number of pregnancies per couple was 4.5. They listed 25 pregnancies lost by abortion or previable birth which gives a rate of 7%. Though we specifically asked for records of each pregnancy, we consider this figure unreliable because we conducted the study by mailed questionnaire, because of anamnestic failure by older respondents, and because every reply was not completed by the mother. The couples also reported eight stillbirths. Thus, they had produced a mean of 4.1 livebirths.
At the time of the study, the mean age of the 76 living mothers was 40.30 years with a range of 22.98 to 70.63 years. Actually, 24 of the 76 living mothers were 45 years or more, which means we may estimate that at least 32% of the sibships were completed. Likewise, at the time of the study the mean age of the 74 living

fathers for whom we obtained information was 43.08 years with a range of 23.36 to 68.21 years.
One couple had two offspring with Gtrisomy in five pregnancies; the proposita in our study was the result of the third pregnancy, born at a maternal age of 20.4 years, and the other affected child was the result of the fifth pregnancy at a maternal age of 24.8 years.
BIRTH ORDER
Table 1 presents the birth order of the G-trisomics by sibship size for 79 of the 80 propositi about whom we obtained data. We found the expected effect of maternal age and birth order using the test described by Haldane and Smith (1948); specifically, the sum of the birth ranks of affected siblings was 1,644, and the theoretical mean sum of the birth ranks of affected siblings was 1,218, with standard deviation of the theoretical mean of 71.5.
SEX RATIO
Table 2 listing the sex ratio shows that it is the normal 1.05 for the total offspring, for the siblings of the G-trisomics, and also for the G-trisomics. The sex ratio of neither the siblings born before the Gtrisomics nor of those born after them is significantly divergent from 1.05 (chi square = 0.08, degree of freedom [d.f.] = 1 for before and chi square = 0.29, d.f. = 1 for after).
PARENTAL AGE BY SEX OF G-TRISOMIC
Table 3 indicates that the mean maternal age at the birth of the females with Gtrisomy was slightly greater than for the males, but this difference was not significant (/>>0.50). In contrast, the same table reveals that the mean paternal age at the birth of the females with the syndrome was somewhat less than for males; however, this difference also was not significant by the t test (0.50 > p > 0.25).

and we also subdivided the G-trisomics and their siblings according to terminal and nonterminal births in their sibships, although we recognized that approximately two-thirds of the families theoretically were not completed. We employed Student's t test for all comparisons.
The interval from a prior birth to that for all G-trisomics, 4.18 years, was significantly different from the interval before all normal siblings, 2.83 years ( £ < 0.005); and, likewise, the intervals prior to the birth of both the female G-trisomics (0.05 > p > 0.025) and the male G-trisomics (p < 0.005) were significantly different from the interval preceding the normals; the difference in intervals preceding the male and the female G-trisomics was not significant.
When we considered the intervals preceding only terminal births, we found similar results. The difference in the intervals preceding all G-trisomics and the normal siblings was significant (p < 0.005), and there were significantly different intervals between the normal siblings and the female G-trisomics (p < 0.005), and the male G-trisomics (p < 0.005) considered separately. Again the difference in the intervals before the birth of female G-trisomics versus male G-trisomics was not significant (p > 0.50). The significant difference in birth intervals before G-triso-

mics compared with their normal siblings arises from the difference in intervals when they are each terminal births. This is apparent from our showing that the intervals of nonterminal births were not different, that is, before all G-trisomics and the normal siblings (0.25 > p > 0.10), before female G-trisomics and the normal siblings (0.25 > p > 0.10), and prior to male G-trisomics and the normal siblings (p > 0.50); in addition, the intervals preceding the female G-trisomics and the male Gtrisomics were not different (0.10 > / » > 0.05).
PARENTAL EDUCATION
We grouped grades and years of education into three-year categories through high school and into two four-year categories beyond high school, our data indicating the exact level achieved. The highest scholastic level attained by the parents, listing first the father and second the mother follows: elementary (altogether 4-6 years of education) 4 and 2, junior high (7-9 years) 15 and 19, senior high (10-12 years) 43 and 45, college (13-16 years) 11 and 12, professional and graduate (17-20 years) 4 and 1, and no information, 3 and 1, for totals of 80. The mean grade level for the 77 fathers was 11.4 and for the 79 mothers was 11.1 years.

For comparison with the general population of West Virginia, we turned to unpublished data of the State of West Virginia supplied through the Bureau of Vital Statistics, which were actually prepared for the Governor's Commission on Mental Retardation as a Task Force Report, 1965. These data categorized the population of each of the 55 counties in West Virginia numerous ways, among which we used the following for this and a subsequent comparison: (1) 1960 population, (2) median school years completed for those over 25 years, and (3) per capita income. When these data were obtained during the 1960 census, the mean age of the mothers of our patients was somewhat more than 32 years and the mean age of the fathers was just 35 years. At these ages, then, the parents were younger than the majority of those over 25 years and thus might be expected to have more years of education than the general population, whether indicated by median or mean.
Our procedure to obtain the population for comparison was: (1) listing the 27 counties in which the parents of the patients resided; (2) listing the population of each of the 27 counties and then computing it as a proportion of the total population of the 27 counties (using 1,226,960 as the denominator in contrast to the total population in the state of 1,860,421); (3) listing the median school years completed by the population of each county and then multiplying this by the county's proportion of the total population previously calculated; and (4) summing the 27 values. For example, county H's population of 77,856 was 0.0634 of the total 1,226,960 persons; 0.0634 times 9.9, the median school years completed by residents of county H, gave 0.63, its contribution to the sum of the mean school years completed by residents of the 27 counties. The result of this procedure was to com-

pare the educational attainment of the parents of the patients with that of the population in their counties of residence, with weighting by the proportionate representation of that county to the total population. The result was 10.0 years. Thus, the parents of the G-trisomics appear to have about one more year of education.
PARENTAL INCOME
We can only assume that the reported income is as reliable as the other data. In our request to the parents we assured them of the confidentiality of their individual responses; in addition, questions concerning both income and education were listed together on a page in the middle of the questionnaire. The annual income listed by the parents, including that of the mother as well as that of the father, follows: 5 families with less than $2,000, 19 from $2,001 to $5,000, 36 from $5,001 to $10,000, 3 from $10,001 to $15,000, 9 with more than $15,001 and 8 supplied no information, for a total of 80.
We estimated the per capita income by: (1) counting the number of persons at home, including those more than 18 years old when their occupation was given as student and when they were unmarried but excluding those more than 18 years who were listed as employed, and including the patients with G-trisomy, regardless of whether in the institution and regardless of age; (2) using the exact figure for annual income when available; (3) taking $2,000 as the income when less than $2,000 was indicated and taking $15,000 as the figure when more than $15,001 was checked, a procedure which probably underestimated the actual income because nearly twice as many parents together gave more than $15,001 as did less than $2,000; (4) utilizing the midpoint of the other three ranges since we asked for and generally received a check mark indicating

410

the appropriate range of income; that is, we used $3,500 for $2,001 to $5,000, $7,500 for $5,001 to $10,000, and $12,500 for $10,001 to $15,000. By this procedure we estimated per capita income as $1,440.
For comparison, employing the same method to obtain an estimate for income as we did for education of the general population of the 27 counties, we found the per capita income to be $1,630.
MALIGNANCY IN THE ANCESTORS
In the questionnaire we asked for either a "yes" or "no" response to the following questions: Does anyone else in the family (including uncles, aunts, cousins, grandparents) have any physical defects, mongolism, or other conditions (such as cancer, leukemia, blood disease, etc.)? To "yes" answers, we requested: Please explain, including a description of the relationship to your mongoloid child (for example: "Mother's sister's son had leukemia," "Father's father had stomach cancer," etc.). Table 5 shows that half again as many grandparents were reported to have malignant disease as the greatgrandparents, who naturally, outnumber

the former by a factor of two. We concluded that information on the greatgrandparents is unreliable for several reasons: for example, the respondents' less adequate knowledge of the more remote generation, the questionnaire's not asking specifically about great-grandparents, and the greater diagnostic accuracy during the lifetime of the more recent generation.
Three ancestors, namely two grandparents and one great-grandparent, were reported to have had leukemia; two had chronic myelocytic leukemia, the other acute lymphatic leukemia. We may estimate the frequency of leukemia among the ancestors of the three previous generations to be at least 3/1,120, since we can safely assume that some of the informants may not have known the health history of their ancestors. Obviously, the three generations of ancestors have had varying lifetimes of exposure to the risk of developing leukemia, but as a probable minimal estimate, if we assume a mean age of 45 years of all 1,120 ancestors, then they represent a total of 1,120 times 45 equals 50,400 years at risk.

the United States was 6.1/100,000 in 1959 (Lerner and Anderson, 1963). Actually, we should have applied the appropriate rates to the exact years the ancestors were at risk, but in the absence of these data and also without evidence that the mortality rate from leukemia has changed drastically, we estimated that 3.1 deaths would be expected in 50,400 years at risk. Consequently, there was no evidence in our patients' ancestors of altered mortality to this one category of malignant disease.
There were 23 instances of malignant disease among the mothers and maternal ancestors and 20 instances among the fathers and paternal ancestors.
DISCUSSION
The reproductive performance of the parents of our subjects may be compared with that of the 110 mothers of living G-trisomics reported by Buck et al. (1966). Their report stated only that many women had not passed the childbearing age so that direct comparison with our data was not possible. From it we calculated that the 110 women had a mean of 3.9 pregnancies, naturally the older women more than the younger. Our population, perhaps older, had a higher mean of 4.5. Likewise from their data, we calculated that approximately 16% of pregnancies in the mothers of G-trisomics were lost, after excluding the G-trisomic which was always a livebirth. When we made a similar correction in every case for ascertainment of a livebirth, we found a rate of nearly 12% fetal loss through abortion and stillbirth. This does not lead us to conclude that our population was less prone to fetal loss because of the likelihood of some incompleteness in our responses.
The significance of our showing a birth order or maternal age effect lies not in that fact itself, for the association of maternal age and therefore also of birth

order has long been recognized; rather, added to our clinical impressions and the cytogenetic data, it reassures us that we studied an average population of patients with G-trisomy. We used a simple exact test for birth-order effect (Haldane and Smith, 1948) which tests whether the probability of a child inheriting a certain condition increases or decreases with its birth rank, other things remaining equal. Given a set of sibships containing normal and affected siblings, in order to determine a maternal age or birth-order effect, the sum (A) of the birth ranks of all affected sibs is compared with its theoretical mean value calculated on the assumption of no effect. If A exceeds this mean by more than twice its standard deviation, then there is evidence that later sibs are most likely affected; but, if A is less than the mean by the same amount, earlier sibs are most probably affected. The sum of the birth ranks of our patients exceeded the theoretical mean value by nearly six standard deviations. However, that maternal age and not birth rank is determinative was shown by Smith and Record (1955), who concluded that although incidence of Gtrisomy increases regularly with increasing birth rank, this association is eliminated when maternal age is fixed.
The sex ratio of the G-trisomics is the same as the secondary sex ratio at birth of the normal population, which is somewhat surprising, since Record and Smith (1955) determined that in infancy and early childhood affected females have greater mortality rates than affected males. More recently, MacKay and Weir (1970) also found rather high sex ratios in northern Ireland and northeastern Scotland.
During 1971 different investigators pursued again the question of a relationship between parental age and sex of the affected offspring. Largey and Largey

(1971) observed that the mean maternal age was lower when the offspring with G-trisomy was female than when male, reporting a mean maternal age difference of 2.97 years and stating that it was significant, though giving no details. Spencer (1971) presented a slightly larger sample with a mean maternal age difference of 3.00 years; however, again, there were no details and no test of significance. Fedrick (1971) had a small sample and found a slightly lower mean maternal age of female patients surviving the neonatal period but a slightly higher mean maternal age of females among patients not surviving the neonatal period, yet neither difference appeared significant.
Subsequent reports with larger numbers (Perry, 1971; Qazi and Lanman, 1971; Ros et al., 1971) including a summary of several previous studies by Perry were not confirmatory; and neither are our data.
Our recording no consanguineous marriages in the 80 couples is not surprising, since the frequency of first cousin marriages in the present general population of the United States has been estimated to be less than 0.1% (Freire-Maia, 1957), and, specifically in a sampling of West Virginia Caucasian coal miners, only 1.1% to 1.5% of marriages were between persons related in any degree (Juberg, 1970). Further, no evidence yet indicates that the progeny of consanguineous matings are more liable to meiotic nondisjunction than those from nonconsanguineous matings (Matsunaga, 1966; Forssman and Akesson, 1967; Juberg and Davis, 1970).
Because of the relatively small number of families in our survey, and the incompleteness of the sibships, and without correction for the effect of maternal age on the frequency of dizygotic twinning, we can only note that we found a higher rate of twin pregnancies than we anticipated, that is, 1.5% compared with 1.0% in Cau-

casians in the United States (Myrianthopoulos, 1970). The question of an association between the cause or causes of meiotic nondisjunction and twinning has been investigated with somewhat conflicting results (Nielsen, 1968; Soltan, 1968; Nance and Uchida, 1964), though presumably the effect would only be with maternally determined nondisjunction.
The significant interval between the preceding birth and the birth of the Gtrisomic, which we showed to be due to terminal births, cannot be satisfactorily explained without additional data, because we do not know the proportions of planned and unplanned pregnancies, nor the ease of conception for the planned proportion, nor the contraceptive practices of the couples. One explanation of an increased birth interval is that it results from pregnancies lost between livebirths. Such an explanation for the increased interval we report is unlikely because we found only 12% of pregnancies wasted, which is lower than the usual rate (Warburton and Fraser, 1964; Buck et al., 1966); even assuming considerable underreporting from the respondents, we consider this reason improbable.
A second reason for an increased birth interval is that the pregnancy was unplanned and came at the end of the mother's reproductive life as an additional rather than a delayed pregnancy. The data of Buck et al. (1966) suggest that the Gtrisomic of the older mother is the result of such an extra pregnancy. In an effort to see what the increased birth interval may mean, we compared our data with the birth intervals in a population reproducing naturally, that is, without any apparent attempt to control fertility by any method. The Amish are just such a group (Juberg, 1966). Juberg (unpublished observation, 1973) found the birth interval preceding the last birth to be 3.14 years

for 153 births in a population for which the mean interval between 815 other births was 2.02 years, excluding the intervals preceding both final and first births. Following the same procedure we have calculated that 3.51 years preceded 731 terminal births and 2.15 years the other 3,424 births in a different group of Amish (Cross and McKusick, 1970). Although the mean interval between all other births in the two Amish populations is less than that of this study, the interval before the final birth is much less, that is, 3.14 and 3.51 years before the normal terminal births versus 5.27 years before the chromosomally abnormal terminal births.
The association of advanced maternal age with a G-trisomic offspring has yet to be explained. One hypothesis attributes aneuploidy to the fertilization of an aging egg as a result of the diminishing frequency of intercourse with increasing years of cohabitation (German, 1968). Another proposal states that the longer interval results from a period of incompatability between mother and fetus, particularly for chromosomally abnormal offspring, which may produce lost pregnancies before an ensuing time of compatability, by which time the chromosomally abnormal fetus is tolerated (Renkonen and Donner, 1964).
Diminishing frequency of intercourse with increasing years of cohabitation naturally decreases the probability of pregnancy as well as increases the intervals between births, depending upon contraceptive practices. If the likelihood of an error in chromatid disjunction rises with aging of the egg (aging in the sense of time from ovulation to fertilization), then diminished frequency of intercourse would be contributory to the production of aneuploid offspring. Another consequence expected of a decline in frequency of intercourse would be increased birth interval. Thus, the greatly lengthened birth interval

preceding the terminal birth of a G-trisomic would appear to support the agingegg hypothesis.
When the data on education and income are considered together, the parents of the patients apparently have more education and less income than the comparison group, perhaps a paradoxical situation except to academics. Actually, without estimates of the variability of our data, which we considered unjustified, we concluded that as judged by education and stated income, the parents of the aneuploids were not significantly different from the general population. It is possible that the more educated parents understood better than the less educated the medical liabilities of the abnormal child and sought more frequent medical care, resulting in some differential survival.
Kaplan and Zsako (1966) found a history of malignant disease among more maternal than paternal ancestors of 40 G-trisomics, but we did not confirm this among the ancestors of 80 patients. Their inquiry may have been more successful than ours because they obtained detailed family histories, whereas we relied solely upon questionnaires. We were particularly interested in the number of ancestors with leukemia, specifically chronic myelocytic, and their degree of relationship to the patient with G-trisomy, under the hypothesis of some type of inherited liability of the Gi chromosome to abnormalities of stability, both of disjunction and integrity. Our failure to find more affected ancestors than expected does not eliminate the possibility of an inherited liability in certain families.
SUMMARY
This study tested our postulate of the existence of living patterns due to socioeconomic or educational similarities which might lead to the recognition of causative factors in meiotic nondisjunction. We ob-

tained data by questionnaire concerning 80 families. The effects of maternal age and birth order were as predicted, and the sex ratio of neither the propositi nor their normal siblings was deviant. Neither maternal nor paternal age differed according to the sex of the propositi. No parents were consanguineous. Frequency of twin pregnancies was greater than expected. Compared with the general population of their counties

of residence in West Virginia, the parents had more education and less income. We calculated intervals between live births determining that 4.18 years preceded the propositi and 2.83 years came before all normal siblings (p < 0.00S); for terminal births the interval preceding the propositi was 5.27 years compared with 2.58 years for the normals (p < 0.005), but for nonterminal births there were no differences.
