ABSTRACT: Family planning clinics and a random sample of private physicians throughout the United States were surveyed in 1972 and 1984 to learn the incidence of performed and refused vasectomy, and to discern attitudinal change over time toward delayed physical and psychological sequelae related to vasectomy. Data show that, after a dramatic rise in popularity in the early 1970's, incidence has fallen significantly in the intervening years. The greater decrease was reported by physicians. Clinics experience a lower refusal rate which may be partially explained by physicians' predilection to practice defensive medicine. Other factors, such as counseling quality and applicant eligibility criteria, show little difference. Concern about physical sequelae has diminished, as has the importance of psychiatric symptomatology as a screening tool. Delayed psychological sequelae remain more ambiguous, with physicians deemphasizing the potential phenomena but clinical staff becoming somewhat more concerned. Nevertheless, both groups refused roughly the same percentage of applicants for psychological reasons.

During the early 1970's, voluntary sterilization became so widely accepted by men that the technique seemed destined to rival the pill as the preeminent fertility control measure. Based on The Association for Voluntary Sterilization (AVS) estimates (AVS, 1983), the number of vasectomies has averaged about a half a million per year since the early 1970's after reaching a high-level mark of just over 700,000 in 1971. While it clearly remains a popular procedure, particularly for couples who have attained their desired family size (Markman, 1982), its popularity seems to have waned somewhat since the early 1970's (Uhlman, 1974).
With the growing popularity of vasectomy, calls for caution emerged in the medical literature regarding contraindications to the procedure. Given the virtually irreversible nature of sterilization,

it is not surprising that there is a consensus regarding the necessity for counseling candidates prior to performance of the operation. There appears to be no consensus, however, on what constitutes counseling, what information should be imparted, or who should be involved in providing guidance. There are no universally accepted guidelines governing the counseling process (Uhlman, 1973,1975).
It has been generally considered that vasectomy is a safe procedure (JAMA, 1981). Several medical practitioners have voiced concern over possible longterm negative physical effects (Roberts, 1968, 1971) as well as potential postoperative psychological sequelae (Rogers, 1965,1967; Ziegler, 1965,1969).
Concern over physical sequelae has focused primarily on anecdotal observations of lymph node enlargement, pro-

longed fever, arthropathy, recurrent infection, glomermbonephritis, intestinal pulmonary fibrosis, elevated level of circulating globulins, elevated BSP retention, and biologic false-positive serologic reaction. Delayed psychological sequelae have been more rigorously studied through longitudinal evaluation, with data suggesting that a demasculinizing potential exists with concomitant negative changes in emotional adjustment and sexual functioning.
Over the intervening decade, empirical studies have accumulated findings which seem to attest to the overall safety of vasectomy. For example, in a study of 10,950 vasectomized and nonvasectomized matched pairs conducted from 1976 through 1982, only one condition, epididymitis, was found more often in vasectomized men. No statistical differences were noted between groups for rates of heart attack, cancer, thrombophlebitis, or impotence (AMA, 1983). Other studies have helped build a convincing case for both physical and psychological safety (Alder, 1981; Brownlee, 1983; Petitti, 1982; Smith, 1981).
To discern the extent to which health professionals' attitudes reflect current knowledge, a survey was conducted in 1972 which provided a picture of eligibility criteria commonly used to screen applicants, presurgical counseling practices, and the incidence of performed and refused vasectomy. The study was replicated in 1984, and this paper reports data spanning twelve years which highlight changes in popularity, counseling practice, attitude toward delayed physical sequelae and psychiatric facets of vasectomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
For both surveys, caregivers were included who acknowledged performing

vasectomies by voluntarily registering with The Association for Voluntary Sterilization (AVS). A mailed questionnaire was used to gather data from a randomly selected sample of private physicians (114) and all registered clinics (72) in 1972, and 97 physicians and 78 clinics in 1984. Return rates ranged from 60 per cent to 75 per cent for both surveys, with clinics attaining the higher rates.
Although both clinical staff and physicians were self-selected, sociodemographic data indicated that respondents were representative of other vasectomists in the health care system. All geographic regions of the United States were included.
Vasectomy performance has traditionally been available through both clinic services and private physicians. This provided a basis for comparing different service delivery modes. While physicians reflect a private practice perspective, clinics oftentimes target a unique clientele and reflect a multidisciplinary staff approach to service delivery.
RESULTS
INCIDENCE OF PERFORMED AND
REFUSED VASECTOMY
The overall quantity of vasectomies performed by private physicians and family planning clinics decreased from the 1972 to the 1984 survey. Whereas the years 1969 through 1971 attest to dramatic growth in the popularity of vasectomies, later survey years (1981-- 83) illustrate a substantial reduction in vasectomy incidence and a leveling at the 6,000 to 7,000 per year range. This pattern is true for both clinics and private physicians.
The reduction is consistent with recent figures in the literature and AVS's own monitoring of incidence through-

groups. Eligibility-related responses (e.g., age, parity, marital status, and nonconsent of spouse) represented the primary categories for refusal. Reasons which would normally emerge during counseling (e.g., psychological prob-

lems, immaturity, coercion by spouse) comprised a second important group.
Compared to 1972 data, both groups in 1984 tended to place slightly lessemphasis on age, marital status, andpsychological problems, but slightly more

emphasis on a man's ambivalence and lack of potential medical or health problems, while physicians reported more idiosyncratic reasons for refusal.
DELAYED VASECTOMY SEQUELAE
Respondents were asked their opinions about a potential link between vasectomy and physical sequelae. Table 3 illustrates that neither physicians nor clinical staff seemed to consider that there was a high likelihood of such a linkage. The per cent change between surveys indicated that more practitioners considered the procedure to be free from adverse reactions.
In considering the potential for psychological sequelae, only 8 per cent of physicians and 18 per cent of clinical staff believed that psychological sequelae should be a major concern. The great majority of physicians stated that sequelae were exaggerated, while only about half of the clinical staff expressed this opinion. However, while the percentage of physicians increased since 1972, comparable clinic data decreased.
In general, findings indicated that physicians clearly viewed vasectomy as unrelated to physical sequelae and considered psychological sequelae to be exaggerated. Clinical staff agreed with physicians, although not as strongly, and were somewhat more likely to consider the potential importance of untoward reactions.
Respondents were asked about specific aspects of psychiatric determinants and influences upon their decision to perform vasectomy. As noted in Table 4, a sizable percentage of both physicians and clinical staff regarded observable psychosis as legal cause to reject an applicant. Nearly half of both groups acknowledged neurosis as legal grounds for vasectomy refusal, and percentages

increased from 1972 to 1984. Perceived legal liability--whether real or imagined--appeared to be a major factor in vasectomy screening.
Fewer of trie respondents placed significance on a past history of emotional instability, and its importance has decreased as an eligibility criterion. Among respondents who routinely allow time for counseling prior to surgery, assessing emotional stability was a higher ranked factor by more clinics than private physicians.
In general, just over half of clinical staff and about 40 per cent of physicians acknowledged that a psychiatric diagnosis gave a clear contraindication for performing a vasectomy. Roughly a third of both groups felt unsure about diagnosis as a contraindication; when considered, psychosis was the obvious psychiatric criterion. Among reasons for refusing to perform vasectomy, neither physicians nor clinical staff considered psychological problems to be a basis for refusal to any great extent (about 20 per cent of all refusals).
COUNSELING THE VASECTOMY
APPLICANT
While the majority of the private physicians provided counseling themselves, clinical counseling roles have clearly changed. In 1972, three-quarters of the clinics relied upon physicians to provide counseling. By 1984, this figure had decreased to about one-third, with the utilization of nurses and vasectomy counselors rising significantly (6per cent to 30 per cent for nurses and 28 per cent to 50 per cent for counselors).
The extent to which a spouse participated in counseling also changed significantly between surveys. In both years, physicians were more likely than clinics to insist on the spouse's involvement: 81

per cent of physicians required spousal participation in 1972, while 61 per cent did so in 1984. The decrease in mandatory participation was even more dramatically illustrated in the clinic setting, where only about 20 per cent of the clinics required the spouse to be involved in 1984 as opposed to 71 per cent in 1972.
Clinics allocated more time to presurgical counseling than did private physicians, as indicated in Table 5. More than half of the physicians in the 1972 survey reported counseling sessions of about 15 minutes, whereas nearly two-thirds of the clinics reported counseling of a half hour or more. In 1972,17 per cent of the

clinics, as compared to just 4 per cent of the physicians, allocated a full hour to counseling.
In the 1984 survey, a greater percentage of physicians reported spending about thirty minutes during the average counseling session, while clinics reported fewer brief sessions (15 minutes) and significantly more hourly sessions. In both settings, the vasectomy applicant seemed to be receiving counseling of longer duration.
In Table 6, presurgical counseling areas are highlighted. In 1972, the three most important components were mutual agreement of the man and spouse

about the desirability of the surgery, reason for seeking the vasectomy, and imparting of information about the surgical procedure. Clinics were most likely to emphasize reason appraisal, while private physicians emphasized mutual decision as being paramount.
However, by 1984, while physicians continued to stress the same three components, family planning clinics significantly deemphasized mutual decision as a counseling priority.
In both survey years, about half of the clinics ranked assessment of the applicant's marital status and emotional stability among the three most important areas of vasectomy counseling. However, there was a sharp decline from 1972 to 1984 in the percentage of physicians who emphasized these factors. In 1984, both groups placed a greater emphasis on an applicant's med-

ical history, and neither sexual compatibility nor religious conflicts assumed much importance.
Both physicians and clinical staff designated five counseling areas as imperative for discussion during counseling sessions:
1. The need for continued contraception following the vasectomy until sperm count shows the ejaculate to be sperm free.
2. The permanency of the surgical procedure.
3. Immediate physical side effects which may occur.
4. Details about the nature of the operative procedure.
5. The difficulties involved in reanastomosis of the vas, i.e., in reversing the procedure.

difficulties of reversing the procedure may, in part, explain the increased counseling time reported by respondents.
DISCUSSION
During the years 1969 through 1971, survey respondents had performed more than 68,000 vasectomies and refused 3,500 applicants. Over the period, private practitioners doubled the number of vasectomies performed, but clinics increased their number of procedures eight times. The number of physicians performing vasectomies rose only slightly, but the number of clinics acknowledging vasectomy performance doubled. The reported growth in elective vasectomy procedures highlights the escalated demand during the early 1970's.
Survey data illustrated a much different pattern for the early 1980's. Respondents reported roughly 40,000 performed vasectomies--a 42 per cent decrease from earlier data. In contrast to earlier growth from year to year, the number performed essentially stabilized, with physicians noting a slight decrease in procedures. Decreases in the survey data tended to confirm an apparent national trend.
Private physicians in both surveys reported more applicant refusals than clinics. Primary reasons given for refusal tended to cluster around either eligibility criteria or counseling assessment.
On the whole, survey data tended to indicate that there was essentially no difference between physician and clinic staff eligibility criteria used in screening, very little variation in counseling practices, and virtually no difference in stated reasons for refusal of applicants. Yet, private physicians consistently re-

ported more applicant refusal than clinics in both surveys. Applicant refusal appeared to be more often a decision of the private practitioner and may be the result of a continuing practice of defensive medicine.
The importance of delayed physical sequelae has decreased over the years. Physicians were much more confident that vasectomy is unrelated to delayed sequelae, while clinical staff were more cautious in their judgment. Nevertheless, a greater percentage of both groups stressed discussion of physical sequelae in presurgical counseling with an applicant.
The pattern for delayed psychological sequelae was quite different for the two groups. While physicians moved toward attaching less importance to psychological sequelae, clinical staff gave greater importance to potential untoward reactions.
In keeping with differing perceptions of possible delayed psychological sequelae, clinical staff were more apt than private physicians to view observable mental dysfunction as a legal basis for vasectomy contraindication; to rank emotional stability as an important applicant assessment factor; to include postoperative psychological sequelae in presurgical counseling; and, to consider specific psychiatric diagnostic categories as contraindicative to elective vasectomy.
It is notable that between 1972 and 1984 differences between physicians and clinics have narrowed considerably. The relatively low reported incidence of applicant refusal due to psychological problems underscored the positive outcome despite uncertain attitudes and concern over delayed sequelae.
Questions raised in the medical liter-' ature about delayed sequelae seem to

Vol. 35, No. 1-2

49

have been largely put to rest. Differences in practices and attitude may have been related more to staff composition than other factors. Data indicated that clinical staff spend more time than physicians in counseling and are more comprehensive and thorough in applicant assessment. If clinical counseling staff (social workers, nurses, psychologists, trained vasectomy counselors) have paid more attention to delayed sequelae and psychiatric symptoms, can it be assumed that applicant refusals at family planning clinics have been more appro-

priate (i.e., men were excluded who would have been more vulnerable to delayed psychological sequelae)? This would be an intriguing question to address in future research.
Recent medical and psychological literature provide very little evidence of delayed sequelae among .vasectomized men or their spouses. Indeed, few untoward reactions are reported at all. It seems paradoxical that practitioners, especially mental health professionals, continue to seek a psychiatric bogeyman.
