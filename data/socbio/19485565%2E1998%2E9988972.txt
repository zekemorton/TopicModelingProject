ABSTRACT:The study examines Chinese fertility in Canada in the context of minority-status and fertility. Chinese-Canadians are compared with British-Canadians, who are considered in this analysis as the majority group. The study is unique in three ways. First, we argue that discrimination brings a minority group not only psychological insecurity but also social-economic insecurity, which can be measured by Chinese husbands' economic status relative to the British. Second, we analyze the relationship between discrimination against the Chinese at the social class level and Chinese fertility behavior at the individual level, which has been ignored by most previous studies. Third, we describe "insecurities" effects to explain the fertility behavior of the Chinese across social classes, including the lower classes to which many researchers believe the minority status hypothesis is not applicable. We conclude that discrimination variations over social classes combined with normative influence are a major factor in causing class fertility differentials between the Chinese and the British in Canada.

Since the mid 1970's the Chinese have grown to be the largest visible minority group in Canada. There were 586,645 Chinese-Canadians enumerated in the 1991 census, constituting 2.2 per cent of the total Canadian population and 7.6 per cent of all immigrants.1 The present study intends to examine Chinese fertility in Canada in the context of the association between minority-status and fertility. The Chinese are compared to the British, who made up 23.5 per cent of the Canadian population in the 1991 census and are considered in this analysis as the majority group in the sociological sense.
We choose British-Canadians rather than the whole whites because BritishCanadians are not only the majority of the whites but also the largest ethnic group in Canada. They best reflect the social-economic characteristics of the ma-

jority at the average. Chinese-Canadians are one ethnic group among the minorities. Comparing them with an ethnic group rather than the whole whites would avoid possible biases.
REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
A dominant approach in the literature on minority group fertility is the characteristics hypothesis which predicts that the distinctive fertility of a racial subgroup arises from the unique social, demographic, and economic distinctions characterizing the minority group. Therefore, it is not race or ethnicity per se but the "characteristics" associated with race or ethnic membership that are thought to have causal import for explaining subgroup fertility. It may be deduced from this thesis that when the social, demographic, and economic characteristics of minority and majority populations become similar, through statistical standard-

ization or at some time in the future, group differences in fertility will disappear (Lee and Lee, 1959). This explanation is also called the assimilationist perspective (Jiobu and Marshall, 1977). However, this hypothesis fails to take into account the presence of discrimination against a minority group and the effects of discrimination on minority fertility behavior.
The minority-status hypothesis developed by Goldscheider and Uhlenberg (1969) introduces the role of discrimination into the analysis of minority fertility behavior. This hypothesis posits that discrimination against minority members per se affects fertility independently of compositional differences between the minority and majority. Their argument is based in part on their analysis of fertility differentials of blacks and whites in the United States. When variables such as education or place of residence were controlled, the more highly educated blacks showed lower fertility than the highly educated whites, thus contradicting expectations of the characteristics hypothesis. The assumed causal mechanism in this effect was explicated as being the depressing effects on black family size of upward mobility in combination with minority status. The social-psychological insecurity felt by upwardly mobile blacks translates into reduced fertility in relation to upwardly mobile whites, who by virtue of their majority status do not feel the same degrees of "insecurities" as do members of a disadvantaged minority group.
The attention gained by the minoritystatus hypothesis has stimulated extensive empirical tests and commentaries in various parts of the world, especially between the 1970's and the 1980's (Sly, 1970;

Ritchey, 1975; Kennedy, 1973; Jiobu and Marshall, 1977; Bean and Marcum, 1978; Johnson, 1979; Johnson and Nishida, 1980; Goodkind, 1995; Burr and Bean, 1997). However, this hypothesis has not received overwhelming support in the literature because of a number of factors.
First, researchers have not discovered direct indicators to measure insecurity caused by discrimination. In order to distinguish the function of insecurity from social-economic characteristics, Goldscheider and Uhlenberg stress the importance of psychological mechanisms. They argue that well-educated minority members experience insecurity psychologically and that the desire for social and economic mobility induces them to work hard and to reduce their childbearing. Since insecurity is considered a psychological variable, it is very difficult to operationalize.
Second, previous studies have focused on either the aggregate or the individual levels of analysis and have paid less attention to comparative analysis at the social class level. An absence of such analysis would result in ambiguous conclusions. For instance, a fertility similarity between a minority group and a majority group at the aggregate level may conceal significant fertility differentials between the two groups at the social class level. In addition, most studies have failed to realize that discrimination against minority members varies across social strata. Thus, the degree of discrimination experienced by minority members varies by one's social class, which would affect fertility behavior differently among minority members in different classes.
Third, Goldscheider and Uhlenberg claim that the minority-status thesis best applies to minority members within the

middle and upper classes. In their opinion, education is the key indicator of assimilation. Once minorities achieve the average education level of the majority, according to the characteristics hypothesis, their fertility level should converge to the majority. However, as observed, welleducated blacks, who have been assimilated to the majority educationally, have lower fertility than the whites. This situation, Goldscheider and Uhlenberg believe, is caused by the minority status. On the contrary, the poorly educated blacks have higher fertility than the majority. Goldscheider and Uhlenberg explain that it is because the desire for upward mobility (which makes the psychological insecurity active) is not as strong as among minority members in the middle and upper classes. Accordingly, minority-status or "insecurities" effects related to discrimination cannot be assumed to apply in the explanation of fertility behavior among lower class members. The above viewpoints may in fact be too limiting.
Johnson (1979) suggests that the higher fertility of less educated blacks might be explained wholly by their disadvantageous social, demographic, and economic characteristics. Because her thesis is based on the comparison between the blacks at low classes and the whites in general, it is less applicable to explaining why poorly educated minority members possess higher fertility than majority members who have the same social-economic characteristics and are at the same classes.
Perhaps this situation can be best explained by normative influences, as suggested by Roberts and Lee (1974), Fisbie and Bean (1978), and Gurak (1977). That is to say, poorly educated minority members may have higher fertility than their majority counterparts because they are

strongly influenced by the group's pronatalist norms when the minority group as a whole possess an identifiable pronatalist culture. Yet, according to Goldscheider and Uhlenberg, minority groups having a pronatalist ideology are not considered as subject to the minority-status and "insecurities" effects. In such cases, high income would likely encourage rather than depress the fertility of minority members in middle and upper classes. From the above discussion, we can see that the minoritystatus hypothesis only applies to certain ethnic groups and certain social classes. It would be desirable to develop, ultimately, an explanation of the fertility behavior across all minority groups and across all social classes.
RESEARCH STRATEGY
The present study is intended (1) to find a direct indicator to measure degrees of discrimination and insecurities, and (2) to explore the impact of discrimination and insecurities on the fertility behavior of the native-born or Canadian-born Chinese across social classes.
We choose native-born or Canadianborn Chinese to test the function of discrimination on fertility for the following reasons. First, the native-born ChineseCanadians are highly assimilated to the majority. In Figure 1, there are five educational levels: elementary school, junior high school, high school, university (undergraduate studies including bachelor degree), and master degree and beyond. Native-born Chinese married males (aged 17-51) and females (aged 15-49) have a much higher percentage with university and higher degrees than the British of the same age category. In Figure 2, occupation is classified as four categories: Skill I

(manual jobs), Skill II (clerical workers and semiskilled manual workers), Skill III (semiprofessionals, supervisors, and senior clerical workers), and Skill IV (managers and professionals). Chinese males and females are more concentrated than the British in the categories of Skill III and IV. These comparisons indicate that the native-born Chinese are highly integrated into the educational and occupational structures of Canadian society. In fact, they surpass the British on these variables.
Second, the Chinese have a pronatalist ideology. Previous studies of Chinese fertility in North America all assumed that there is no pronatalist ideology associated with this group (Goldscheider and Uhlenberg, 1969; Jiobu and Marshall, 1977; Johnson, 1980; Chui and Trovato, 1989). In fact, traditional Chinese culture is very pronatalist (Cleland et al., 1983; Coale, 1984; Stacey, 1983; Croll, 1985; Banister, 1987; Tang, 1995). Freedman and Coombs (1974) organized and coordinated a project concerning sex preference among developing and developed countries in the early years of the 1970's. According to their report, Taiwan belonged to the group with strong son preference. The mean number of sons preferred by the Chinese in Taiwan was 2.1 and the mean number of desired children was 3.9, which was not only higher than those of European countries and the United States, but also higher than those of most developing countries, including India, Korea, and Thailand. Son preference is a key mechanism in formulating Chinese pronatalist culture and is also directly related to the desire for a large family size.
Since World War II Chinese reproductive norms have changed gradually over

time. The norm of large family size has been replaced by small family size. It has been reported that the total fertility in the whole Chinese world dropped dramatically in the 1980's. However, it cannot be assumed that pronatalist ideology has completely vanished. Traditional reproductive norms concerning family size still exert a certain influence on some Chinese families, especially in the countryside and among the poorly educated. Since the traditional family value of continuing clans and generations sustains strong influence on Chinese family life, son preference (as well as universal marriage to some degree) has not lost its significance in reproductive norms. This family value would keep the fertility rate in the Chinese world higher than in the Western world (Huang, 1982; Arnold and Liu, 1986; Freedman, 1986; Cooney and Li, 1994). From Table 1 we can see that as compared with British-Canadians, the Chinese fertility pattern in all the three major Chinese areas displays pronatalist endowments. Even at the youngest age group (20-24), which could be most Westernized, the Chinese women (except for those in Hong Kong) have more children than British-Canadian women.
One may assume that such pronatalist influence should also exist in some degree among the Chinese in North America. Based on an estimation made by Basavarajappa and Halli (1984), the Chinese in Canada had the second highest fertility among a large number of Canadian ethnic groups between 1921 and 1961. According to the 1971 Canada census, Chinese women aged 1 5 ^ 9 , including both foreign-born and native-born, possessed a higher fertility rate than British-Canadians at the average as well as at almost every education level.

women could be regarded as the parental generation of the Chinese women at the same ages in the 1991 census and had direct normative influence on the fertility behavior of the Chinese women in this study. Therefore, the often-held assumption in the literature that the Chinese in North America have no pronatalist ideology does not hold true.
Third, choosing the native-born Chinese could exclude the possible confounding effects of the immigration process. We will address this issue in detail later.
As explained by the minority-status hypothesis, discrimination engenders insecure feelings among minority group members. Yet, the consequences of discrimination is not only psychological but also physical, mainly appearing as economic insecurity. Economic insecurity, which determines social security, plays the same role as psychological feelings in driving minorities to work hard, and, at the same time, reinforces the insecure feelings (see Figure 3).
Economic insecurity, as an index of discrimination, could be measured quantitatively. We develop such a measure by taking the ratio of annual income per

schooling year of minority members divided by the same value of majority members (i.e., British-Canadians in this paper).2 We call this Relative Economic Status (RES). As salary (or wage) reflects the extent of discrimination more accurately than income, in this study, salary is employed in the estimation of RES. If Chinese-Canadians have the same education as BritishCanadians, controlled for age or working experience, but do not earn the same amount of money, we assume there is discrimination against them. Starting from this point of view, if the RES ratio is close to or more than unity, the Chinese have the same as or relatively better economic status than the British, and therefore greater economic security and less discrimination. If the ratio is less than unity, the Chinese have a relatively inferior economic status, which means less economic security (or stated differently economic insecurity compared to the British), and greater discrimination. This ratio could be calculated for individuals, social classes, and communities to determine individual economic security, class economic security, and com-

munity economic security respectively, presenting degrees of discrimination at the three levels.3 Since this study focuses on the effects of group context on individual behavior, RESat social class level or class economic security will be most often used.
With regard to attained social-economic status, education might be onearea where minorities would perhaps experience the least discrimination. However, equalization of education levels would not necessarily offer minority members the same job opportunities. It was observed that blacks' occupational chances in the United States were consistently inferior to whites (Blau and Duncan, 1967; Blau, 1987; Gill, 1993). According to theNational Longitudinal Survey of YoungMen (NLS), for these individuals who stated
3Individual RES (in society) = individual wage per schooling year of the minority/community mean of annual wage per schooling year of the majority. Individual RES (in specific class) = individual wage per schooling year of the minority/class mean of annual wage per schooling year of the majority. Class RES = class mean of annual wage per schooling year of the minority/class mean of annual wage per schooling year of the majority. Community RES = community mean of annual wage per schooling year of the minority/community mean of annual wage per schooling year of the majority.

that they desired to work in managerial sales and clerical, and craft occupations, blacks were significantly less likely than whites to endup working in these occupations, controlling for such factors as education andtraining background.
Even if minority members are offered the same job as majority members, pay may notbe equal. Blau andDuncan (1967) noted that in the United States the occupational status of both the Japanese and the Chinese was higher than that of the whites, but the income level of whites was nevertheless the highest of all ethnic groups. They believed that this discrepancy must be attributed to ethnic status itself and probably to discrimination. Minority members are more likely integrated into the educational institution than into the institutional income. The 1995 CPS (Current Population Survey) reports that the people who have an education of four years of college account for 24 per cent of the whites and 28.5 per cent of the Asians in the United States. But, per capital income is $18,304 for whites andonly $16,567 for Asians. Thus, income, especially wage differentials at the same education level, may be viewed as an objective indicator of degree of injustice against the minority.

Economic insecurity among minority groups may be reduced by female labor force activity. In our patriarchal society, discrimination against minorities often concentrates on minority males. If a minority husband has inferior RES, his wife would probably work hard to supplement family income and thus maintain living standards compatible with their social status, which could be represented by the husband's education. The average living standard within a specific social class is usually modelled on the consumption level and pattern of the majority group, which may explain why levels of employment among black women have historically exceeded those of white women in the United States (Shapiro and Mott, 1979; Herring and Wilson-Sadberry, 1993). A high level of wives' labor force participation would, all things being equal, reduce childbearing. In this sense, it could be proposed that husband's RES is a principal factor in shaping a household's family size. These mechanisms are shown in Figure 3.
We will explore the relationship between discrimination against Chinese males at a given social class (or at a given education level) and Chinese females' fertility behavior at both individual and social class levels. We are interested in husbands' RES at the social class level because discrimination against minorities varies with classes. It has been observed that white-nonwhite income differentials in the United States increase with increasing education. The largest income differential between whites and nonwhites was observed for men with some college. In 1995, the amount of earnings for African Americans without a highschool education was 94.9 per cent of the income of whites. African Americans

with a high school education earned 89 per cent, and African Americans with a college education earned 72 per cent. Thus, discrimination against minorities is probably more severe in the middle and upper classes than in lower classes. We hypothesize that the lower the education level of Chinese husbands, the less severe the discrimination against them and thus the greater the relative degree of economic security. In such a context, there is less necessity for Chinese wives to work hard, and as a result the fertility of the Chinese relative to that of the British at a given class will be higher. By contrast, the higher the education level of husbands, the more severe the discrimination and thus the lower the husbands' relative economic security. Correspondingly, there is greater necessity for Chinese wives to work hard, and therefore the fertility of the Chinese relative to that of the British at a given class will be lower. Pronatalist culture is assumed in our hypothesis that improvement in Chinese husbands' economic security (as measured by RES) will positively affect their family size. At higher levels of economic insecurity, the effect of pronatalism on fertility becomes unimportant, because it would be overcome by considerations of economic security.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data from the Public Use Sample Tape (PUST) of the 1991 Canada census are utilized in this study. The unit of analysis is native-born or Canadian-born currently married women aged 15-49 of Chinese or British ethnicity. It is impossible to acquire current fertility data from the 1991 Canada census. As an alternative, this study employs the number of

children ever born as a proxy on the assumption that Chinese women maintained their social-economic characteristics until the time of the 1991 census.
A major issue in studies conducted in the past regarding minority-status is that immigration effects were not separated from other fertility determinants, which is perhaps one reason why there appeared contradictory findings in previous research concerning Chinese fertility in North America. Some studies employed intercept difference in the minority/majority regression decomposition equation (Jiobu and Marshall, 1977; Halli, 1987) to explain the role of minority-status in Chinese fertility behavior. As immigrants make up a large percentage of the Chinese living in North America, the intercepts could be affected by various factors in immigration process and therefore can not be regarded as pure functions of minority status. In addition, immigrants would possibly compare their income with their economic conditions in their home countries, so that their conclusions about their economic security could be very different from their Canadian-born compatriots. Furthermore, as immigrants do not speak fluent English and could not find a job relevant to their education, their relative economic status (RES) would be worse than their native-born compatriots. Under this situation, minority-status effects or insecurities effects on fertility behavior could be distorted. Choosing the native-born Chinese excludes the possible confounding influence from immigration.
This study is concerned with how Chinese husbands' economic status influences their wives' fertility behavior. Data on husbands' social-economic variables and wives' variables would be needed.

Unfortunately, the PUST file does not contain explicit information on the Chinese (as they are lumped with "other ethnicities"). We use data from the individual file and assume that married Chinese males are husbands of married Chinese females in the same file. Strictly speaking, some of these assumed "linked" couples are not in actuality married. Since this study focuses on the role of group context (i.e., husband, class, economic security) on individual behavior, this assumption is not very problematic. In order to eliminate international marriage, only respondents who married a Chinese person are considered in this study. Generally, the age difference between wives and husbands is about two years (husbands being older); married males aged 17-51 are included in this study to complement the females aged 1 5 ^ 9 . It is commonly held that traditionally Chinese women should not marry men who are less educated than they (Cheung, 1988; Leete, 1994). We found from the family file in the 1980 Canada census that 67.3 per cent of Chinese women were married to men with the same education and 28.2 per cent of them were married to men with higher education. Under the circumstances, we assume that Chinese wives have the same education as their husbands and therefore are in the same social class as their husbands.
DESCRIPTIVE OVERVIEW
Table 2 describes Chinese husbands' RES by education and occupation which, as mentioned above, is a measure of economic security caused by discrimination. Chinese husbands have inferior actual RES at three educational levels (high school, university, and master degree plus) but favorable RES at two educational levels

(elementary and junior high school). The higher the education, the lower the Chinese husbands' RES. The similar trend appears in Chinese husbands' RES at four occupation categories. The higher the occupational class, the lower the RES. These figures show clearly that discrimination against the Chinese is more severe at middle and upper classes than at lower classes.
The amount of wage could be affected by working experience. We did not find significant changes as compared with the actual RES after standardizing Chinese husbands' RES on the length of working experience (age minus numbers of years in school), which means, even controlled for age or working experience, Chinese husbands at middle and upper classes still make less money than the British. This finding demonstrates that the wage differentials between the two groups are mainly generated by discrimination.
Table 3 shows a comparison of number of weeks worked in 1990 and labor force participation rates between Chinese and British wives. The ratios of Chinese wives'

weeks worked and labor force participation rate relative to the British go upward while their husbands' relative economic status (RES) goes downward. The higher the Chinese wives' education level, the more the weeks worked as well as the higher the labor force participation rate compared to British wives. This finding is consistent with our expectations that Chinese husbands' RES or economic security would have a bearing on their wives' labor force activity. One may argue that our assumption about women's working to supplement a deficit in husbands' income ignores other influences. However, even though other factors such as self-satisfaction play important roles in women's employment, we cannot deny that economic initiatives are still the most active driving power. Apart from economics, we are unable to explain why well-educated Chinese women worked more time than the British women with the same education. In 1981, as a result of working more, AfricanAmerican women with four years of college or more earned 82.3 per cent as much as similarly educated black men, whereas

white women earned only 66.5 per cent as much as white men. Meanwhile, African American women with a junior-highschool education or less earned 71.1 per cent as much as black men, whereas white women earned 63.8 per cent as much as white men (Mellor and Stamas, 1982). Obviously, this finding cannot be attributed to African-American women's higher initiatives of self-satisfaction.
One may also argue that insecure feelings of their own desires for mobility drive highly educated Chinese wives to work hard. If we extend the comparison to nonmarried Chinese women aged 15^9, this picture would be clearer. Table 4 indicates that nonmarried Chinese women at most education levels work less and have lower labor force participation rates than their British counterparts. Their employment behavior is evidently different from that of married Chinese women. This finding suggests that nonmarried Chinese women do not experience the pressure from men's economic insecurity and do not need to work as much as married Chinese women, who need to keep their living standards compatible with their family social status. Desires for mobility could exert a certain influence on the married Chinese women. However,

the pressure resulted from their husbands' inferior RES would be the most important driving factor in their employment. For most Chinese, family income still depends highly on husbands' income.
Table 5 shows the fertility (i.e., the number of children ever born) to Chinese and British wives. There is no education level of elementary school for the Chinese women in this sample. Chinese fertility at three education levels including high school, university, and master degree beyond, is lower than that of the British. At junior-high-school level, the Chinese have higher fertility.
Figure 4 summarizes the relationship between Chinese husbands' RES (as shown by Column 1 in Table 2) and Chinese wives' fertility behavior at class levels. The latter is operationalized as the ratio of Chinese fertility relative to that of the British (as shown by Column 3 in Table 5) and follows the trend of the former, the index of economic security. This finding illustrates that Chinese husbands' economic security has a positive impact on their wives' childbearing. In other words, discrimination against the Chinese husbands at a given social class negatively affects their wives' fertility behavior. From the figure we can see that the

behavior. The appropriate statistical method for the analysis of variables at two different levels, social classes (i.e., macro-level) and individuals (i.e., microlevel), is contextual analysis, which concerns the role of group context on the actions and attitudes of individuals (Iversen, 1991). A fundamental assumption of contextual analysis is that themicro values of the response variable in some way depend on the social context, and the effects of the micro determinants may vary systematically as a function of the social context. A Chinese wife's childbearing is affected by not only her individual social, economic, and demographic characteristics, but also the social-economic environment, that is tosay, it is affected by discrimination against her husband in the class context. Here, Chinese husbands' RES at a given class is regarded as a macro-level variable.

It is said that ordinary least-square regression model (OLS)would result inunreliable estimates of standard errors in dealing with multi-level analysis (Cochran, 1977). The random-coefficient model (RC) can handle data collected at different levels of a hierarchy in an appropriate way (Kraft and Leeuw, 1994). In this sense, RC model is utilized in this study. Suppose we have P explanatory variables X - (p = 1, P) at the individual level, and Q explanatory variables G^ (q = 1,
Q) at the social class level, following the approach of Mason, Wong, and Entwisle (1984), the micro equation is given by
where Y is the micro dependent variable, X is the micro regressor (independent variable), j = 1, ..., J denotes contexts

years of schooling).5 One independent variable is measured at the class level: Chinese husbands' RES within five education levels (i.e., elementary school, junior high school, high school, university, andM.A.+).
A principal assumption of RC model is that elements at both group and individual levels are randomly sampled. Some scholars have considered social classes as fixed categories. In this study, however, social classes are assumed randomly sampled because the classes are categorized on the randomly selected elements. Therefore, classes in this study could be considered a sample of classes in population.
To make a comparison with multilevel analysis, we first use an ordinary least square regression model (OLS) to test the effects of individual level variables on Chinese wives' fertility behavior. The regression equation is given by

This model is a mixed model, containing fixed coefficients (the T\'S) and random coefficients (the a's).4 Children-everborn (CEB) by married Chinese females aged 15-49 is the dependent variable Y-.

cients, and e¡ is the error term. We have five independent variables at the individual level as mentioned previously. Generally, women would have more children with their increasing age during their reproductive span. We expect that age will have positive effect on CEB. It is hypothesized that income would negatively affect women's fertility behavior because, under most situations, behind high income, there is usually more working time or more schooling years, which would reduce fertility. Labor force activity will also negatively affect CEB. Chinese women who participated in labor force would possibly bear fewer children than those not in labor force. Meanwhile, Chinese women who worked more time will possibly have fewer children than those who worked less time, assuming that these women had held this working pattern by the census time. Finally, we expect that there will be a negative relationship between schooling years and CEB.

(terms defined earlier). The RC model omits EMP which was
not significant in OLS model. The program MLn is employed in the computation.6 The parameter estimates, constant, and two variance estimates, cr| for the residual variance at the class level, and CT¿ for constant variance at individual level, are summarized in Table 7.
The signs of these parameter estimates are the same as those in the OLS model and all the estimates are statistically significant.
The next step involves the addition of the class variable G : (i.e., macro-level variable), Chinese husbands' RES at five education levels, to this model, giving the following equation (terms defined earlier):

The multivariate regression coefficients are given in Table 6. AGE has a positive effect and all the other variables have negative effects on children ever born, suggesting that Chinese fertility increases with age, but decreases with the increasing education, labor participation rate, working time, and income. This is consistent with the observation of most previous studies. All independent variables are statistically significant except for employment (EMP).
We now switch to the random-coefficient model (RC) to execute the contextual analysis. Following the approach adopted by Hox (1994) in his research, we first examine the micro-level-only model, which contains explanatory variables at the individual level as fixed variables. Equation (4) simplifies to:

The parameter estimates, constant, and variances are summarized in Table 7. Chinese husbands' RES is a "structural" variable at class level, meaning that the measurement is made from community or group characteristics not from individuals. Therefore, we could avoid the possibility of an issue of inter-correlation between class-level and individual-level variables.
The subsequent model is Equation (4), which is a complete single equation of RC model and includes interaction terms

of micro (individual) variables and macro (class) variables. In this study the only significant interaction term is that of Weeks Worked with the class variable RES (WEEKRES). We only show this term in Table 7.
The comparison of the variances across the models and déviances based on the chi-square test show the fit of the different models (Hox, 1994). From Table 7 we can

see that the values of Q-2 and Q-2 reduce from one model to the next; thus, both the individual and class variables explain a significant portion of the initial variance in children ever born. Moreover, the more terms in the model, the smaller the values of the deviance. Hence, the more complete models provide a better fit.
After adding the class variable to the model, we discover that Chinese hus-

bands' RES has a positive effect on children-ever-born. That is to say, if discrimination against Chinese husbands at a given class is reduced, Chinese husbands would be more secure economically and then their wives would have more children. The sign of the interaction term involving WEEKS (which could be regarded as the indicator of women's labor force activity) and RES indicates that improved economic security within a given class would lower the negative effect of Chinese wives' working on fertility. This point can be further explored in Table 8, which displays the partial derivatives of wives' weeks worked on children ever born conditional on husbands' RES level. This table illustrates that the negative effect of Chinese wives' working on children-ever-born becomes weaker when Chinese husbands' relative economic status becomes increasingly better. This result could be explained from two perspectives. First, Chinese wives would probably reduce their labor force activity and consequently increase their childbearing when their husbands have better economic security (higher RES). Second, Chinese wives in upper social classes may feel more pressure than those at lower classes due to their husbands' low RES. If the former work the same time as the latter, the former would have fewer children.
DISCUSSION
The descriptive statistical analysis shows that the native-born Chinese have been well integrated educationally and occupationally to the majority group, represented by British-Canadians. However, they have not achieved the same economic status as the British even controlling for age and working experience. We

hypothesized that this finding is a function of discrimination. Chinese husbands' relative economic status deteriorates with increasing education. The most severe discrimination occurs at the highest education levels, suggesting that the door leading to the ruling class and managerial stratum for the Chinese is not open widely.
As indicated in most previous studies of minority-status and fertility, we observed that at low levels of education the Chinese-Canadians have higher fertility than the British-Canadians and that at high levels of education Chinese fertility is below that of the British. Correspondingly, we found that as the relative economic status of Chinese husbands rises, the fertility of Chinese wives relative to the British also rises, and vice versa.
The Chinese people in Canada are a minority group with a relatively high fertility culture. Their fertility behavior is affected by both minority status (i.e., discrimination) and pronatalist ideology (as compared to the mainstream culture). To illustrate the effects caused by the two conflicting functions, we need to introduce the concepts of economic security in society and economic security in specific social class.
Discrimination against a minority operates at both the society level and social

190

class level. The two types of discrimination would separately affect a minority male member's income relative to the average earned by the majority in society and his income relative to the average earned by the majority in a given social group with which it is identified. This discrimination would determine the minority member's economic security in society and also his economic security within a class.
In general, a minority member's economic status as well as social status is limited by his education. On the one hand, he will not be able to pursue the economic status beyond his education. On the other hand, he will not be satisfied with the economic status which cannot provide him with the same average living standard as the majority in his social class (characterized by education). Therefore, for a minority family, the husband's relative economic status or the index of economic security or insecurity in his social class (which also determined his social status in that class) may be of more significance than his relative economic status in society. In other words, a minority family would most likely seek economic security accommodated with their social class. As a result, in affecting minority individual reproductive behavior, discrimination in a given social class, which directly determines a minority member's class economic security, plays a more important role than discrimination in society, which explains why we focus on the impact of discrimination in the class context.
It seems that discrimination against the Chinese is less severe at low classes than at middle and upper classes. A poorly educated Chinese man may feel secure economically in his class despite his inferior

economic status in society. In this context, the traditional Chinese pronatalist ideology would serve to enhance childbearing. A well-educated Chinese man may feel insecure economically in his social class even though his economic status is relatively favorable in society, as compared with low classes. In this situation, his pronatalist orientation would be overridden by economic security considerations, his wife would likely increase her labor force activity, and fertility would therefore decline. However, it does not mean that pronatalist ideology has less influence on the middle and upper classes than on the low classes, but rather means that economic insecurity would weaken Chinese normative influence. Our contextual analysis denotes that if discrimination is reduced and economic security improved, due to the inherently pronatalist culture, the Chinese people would probably increase their childbearing regardless of the level of education.
We may conclude from this study that economic insecurity (or security) measured by RES within a given class combined with normative influence could be a critical factor in affecting class fertility differentials between the Chinese and the British in Canada. For the Chinese at middle and upper classes, as long as discrimination against a minority does not disappear altogether, the Chinese will not be able to entirely achieve the same economic and social status as the British and therefore will not feel secure economically and socially, even if they have successfully assimilated educationally and occupationally. Consequently, they will reduce their fertility. For the Chinese at low classes, where discrimination is not so severe as that at middle and upper classes and where they have relatively

Vol. 45, No.3-4

better social and economic status within their classes, the pronatalist culture would influence them to bear more children. Under the circumstances, class fertility differentials between the two groups will not necessarily disappear. The ethnic fertility discrepancy is mainly attributed to the normative distinctions and socialeconomic inequalities. These distinctions and inequalities are determined by ethnicity and discrimination. In this sense, this study affords a certain support to the minority-status hypothesis.
An important limitation in this study is imposed by a lack of available information. For instance, current fertility data would be more valuable in establishing an explicit causal model for Chinese fertility behavior and determinants. Onedimension that needs to be explored in future studies is to extend the study of discrimination thesis to other minority

groups. Wehave concluded that discrimination variations over social classes are a major factor causing fertility differentials between the Chinese and the British in Canada. Whether this conclusion is applicable only in the Chinese case or it is of general significance depends on the application of the thesis to other groups.
