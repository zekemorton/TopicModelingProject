ABSTRACT: Ethological studies suggest that animal populations that live in crowded conditions display a number of behaviors that tend to limit the size of the population, such as aberrant forms of sexual behavior, small litter sires, a higher incidence of spontaneous abortion, ineffectual maternal care, and even cannibalism of their young. Studies of household crowding in North America cities have produced only modest and selective evidence that crowding has similar effects among humans. In this paper, we examine the effect of household crowding on marital sexual relations, on desire for additional children, and on fetal and child loss in Bangkok, Thailand, a city with a much wider range of household crowding than is typically found in North America. In spite of the wider range, and higher mean level of crowding, we find that both the objective and subjective dimensions of crowding have only modest selective effects on sexual and reproductive behavior.

Most of what is known about crowding and sexual behavior--and, more generically, about crowding and reproductive behavior--is derived from ethological research. Unfortunately, findingsfrom research on animal populations have sometimes been uncritically extrapolated to human populations. In this paper, after first reviewing some of the ethological research and the prior research on humans, we examine the effects of household crowding in one relatively crowded environment, namely, Bangkok, Thailand.
BACKGROUND: PRIOR RESEARCH
Observations of crowded animals have suggested that lower animals exhibit aberrant forms of sexual behavior, aberrant at least in terms of the respective patterns normally observed in those animal populations. Investiga-

tions of crowded house mice, voles, Mongolian gerbils, wild monkeys, fish, and laboratory as well as wild rats note a diverse set of sexual pathologies (Southwick, 1955; Louch, 1956; Jillings, 1967; Susiyama, 1967; Morris, 1952; Calhoun, 1962). In some cases, the observations are of interrupted copulation, such as among crowded house mice. Other studies report hypersexuality as a result of dense conditions. A high incidence of homosexuality has been noted, particularly among crowded fish. Some investigations indicate there is a combination of these aberrations, suggesting that crowding precipitates pansexual behavior on the part of certain animals.
Calhoun's classic study (1962) is one of the better controlled experiments on crowding effects. Under high and unchecked crowding conditions--what Calhoun refers to as a behavioral sink --several pathological behaviors developed among the rats in the experi-

ment. These ranged from extreme withdrawal on the part of some animals to the frenetic overactivity of others. Cannibalism emerged. Sexual deviation was widespread. Hypersexuality was one such deviation. Females in estrus were relentlessly pursued by packs of males, unable to divert the unwanted attention of the males. Some males became pansexual, apparently unable to discriminate between appropriate and inappropriate sexual partners. Another group of male rats became completely passive, paying no attention to even the estrous females in their midst. Still other males became what Calhoun termed "probers," who engaged in both hypersexual and homosexual activities.
The evidence concerning the effect of crowding on the reproductive behavior of animals is somewhat more consistent, generally reporting an inverse relationship. Particularly among rats and mice, it has been observed, crowded conditions are related to smaller litter size and a higher incidence of spontaneous abortion (Calhoun, 1962; Davis, 1964; Snyder, 1968). Crowded females engage in ineffectual maternal care, raising the probability of infant mortality, and sometimes resort to cannibalism of the young. In one experiment where the animal population was allowed to reach a peak, 30 litters were subsequently born without any of the young surviving (Christian et al., 1965). In reaction to high population density, declines in fertility also have been observed among birds, elephants, rabbits, wolves, chickens, and deer (Perrins, 1965; Laws and Parker, 1968; Lockley, 1961; Hoffman, 1958; Siegal, 1959; Christian et al., 1960).

While this body of ethological research is indeed suggestive, it must be interpreted very cautiously in extrapolating it to human populations. What looks to us as pathological and ultimately dysfunctional behavior among these various animals--and perhaps so among humans--actually may have utilitarian value. Withdrawal, interrupted copulation, bisexuality, and homosexuality each serve to check population growth. Along with a high rate of infant mortality, which often occurs under extreme crowding conditions, sexually deviant behavior can be functional in serving as a populationreducing mechanism, bringing some measure of equilibrium back to the group.
Furthermore, the analogy between human behavior and that of other species breaks down at some crucial points. Environmentally, there is little similarity. Most of the evidence on sexual pathologies comes from the study of rodents, and some of the strongest evidence stems from experimental situations. For these animals, there is no escape from crowded conditions. Crowding is a constant part of their lives. Even among so-called freeroaming animals, territoriality may impose severe limitations on the ability to escape from crowding. Human habitats seldom have such limitations. There is, moreover, no cross-species analogue to the human experience of feeling crowded and a perceived lack of privacy. These are symbolically conceived and may be symbolically expressed experiences that are absent in other animals. Inasmuch as the subjective experiences of crowding for humans may be more important than the objective circumstances themselves,

214

Edwards et al.

comparisons with other animals may be altogether inappropriate.
As far as natality and reproductive behavior are concerned, the analogy between humans and other species is incomplete. In other species, sex and reproduction are governed by the estrous cycle of females. As a result, the natality rate among most animals approximates the limits of their biological potential. Humans make choices as to when to have sexual intercourse and under what circumstances they will do so. While women are able to conceive twelve months of the year, most seek to limit their pregnancies, so that human natality is usually far below biological capacity.
It is also the case that the ethological research is not as unequivocal as it first may appear. Significantly, most of the studies dealing with the effects of population densities on animal behavior are silent about the existence of any sexual deviations or unusual reproductive behavior. Some investigations even note that there are no significant relationships between high density, sexual behavior, and reproduction (Syme, 1973). Others suggest that fertility may actually increase as a result of crowding (Ludwig and Boost, 1939). As we mentioned, most of the attention has been focused on rodents in experimental situations. Until there are more observations of a broader range of animals in natural settings, we need to be wary of generalizing these findings to other animal species, let alone to humans.
What evidence we have regarding the impact of crowding on human sexual relations and reproductive behavior is quite limited and often inconsis-

tent. Based on some of the ethological evidence, Galle and his associates (1972), using aggregate data, found crowding to be positively associated with a high fertility rate. This, they speculated, could stem from either the sort of hypersexuality observed in some other crowded animals or could result from the inability to plan carefully, which would be reflected in the inconsistent use of birth control. Galle and Gove (1979) later replicated the finding about high fertility using data from four different time periods.
In a rather unique study dealing with the residents of Ciudad Kennedy, a government-constructed satellite city of Bogata, Columbia, Felson and Solaun (1975) found just the opposite. Two types of dwellings were available, individual houses and apartments. The apartments were close to three times the size of the houses. After controlling for key variables affecting fertility and possible self-selection factors, Felson and Solaun found that the apartment dwellers reduced their fertility, while occupants of the houses increased theirs. The house dwellers had the ability to increase needed space by adding rooms, whereas the apartment residents were unable to neutralize any increases in objective crowding. The response on the part of the latter, Felson and Solaun suggest, was simply to reduce the number of children they otherwise may have had.
Two important studies provide evidence concerning the effect of household crowding in North America. In his study of household crowding in Toronto, Booth (1976) examined two aspects of reproduction: number of pregnancies and total infant mortality

(which included induced abortion, spontaneous abortion, proportion stillborn, and proportion dying in the first year of life). Neither aspect of reproduction was related to either objective crowding or subjective crowding.
In a related analysis, using the Toronto data, Edwards and Booth (1977) focused on the sexual behavior of those living in crowded circumstances. This involved an examination of marital relations, extramarital affairs, homosexual contacts, and incestuous experience. On the assumption that crowding interferes with privacy, one of the questions asked in regard to marital sex had to do with whether the respondents had ever refrained from having intercourse because of a lack of privacy. This, it turned out, was one of the strongest findings. Subjective crowding was strongly related to reports that a lack of privacy interfered with intercourse. The perceived lack of privacy was not, however, followed by any appreciable withdrawal from sexual activity. If anything, crowded individuals tended to have marital coitus somewhat more frequently than people living in less compressed conditions. A similar tendency was observed with respect to the other forms of sexual behavior that were examined. Those in crowded households had slightly elevated levels of extramarital, homosexual, and incestuous activities. However, the differences between crowded and uncrowded people were small and generally not statistically significant. Crowding in itself, Edwards and Booth point out, explains a very modest portion of the variance in sexual behavior, and they contend (1977, p. 805) that human sexual behavior--

perhaps unlike that of other animals-- "is not appreciably influenced by crowded conditions."
A parallel analysis of marital sexuality and reproductive behavior is contained in a study conducted in Chicago. Gove and Hughes (1983) found that both their objective and subjective indicators of crowding were related to reports that a lack of privacy sometimes prevents sexual intercourse, and there was a small--but statistically significant--negative relationship between persons per room and the frequency of marital intercourse. In short, neither the Toronto nor the Chicago study finds any evidence of hypersexuality, contrary to some of the reports contained in the ethological literature.
With regard to reproductive behavior, a series of questions was posed in the Chicago study asking about the desire for children, birth control practices, and the occurrences of miscarriages and abortions. Two indexes were used having to do with the desire for children. One was calculated by dividing the number of offspring the respondent already had, or expected to have, by the number desired. Overcrowded individuals generally had more children than they ideally wanted. The second index concerned simply a response as to whether the respondent currently was "purposely trying to have a child." Persons per room, as Gove and Hughes expected, was negatively associated with the desire for an additional child, but the subjective crowding measures were only weakly related to this variable. One subjective indicator (lack of privacy), in fact, was positively related to the attempt to have another child, which is

216

contradictory to overcrowded people reporting that they presently have more children than they actually want.
If people residing in crowded households have more children than they think are an ideal number, on the surface they would seem to have a powerful incentive for practicing birth control. However, for the adults who live in crowded households, there is a counter-hypothesis. Galle and his colleagues (1972) have argued that crowding in the household, simply because there are too many people around, makes it difficult to plan one's activities, and practicing birth control clearly requires planning and a conscious effort on the part of the sexual partners. If crowded couples already have more children than they perceive as ideal, this is prima facie evidence that they tend to be poor family planners. Overall, Gove and Hughes found that crowding has little effect on whether individuals practice birth control, but it does have a small effect on sometimes forgetting to do so.
The Chicago investigation also explored the issue of the impact of crowding on fetal mortality, an issue raised in ethological research and found by Booth (1976) not to apply to the Toronto sample. Gove and Hughes (1983), however, did find a persistent relationship between persons per room and the occurrence of a miscarriage or abortion, even after a number of controls were introduced. The subjective crowding measures were not so related. Gove and Hughes are careful to point out, though, that they had no information on whether the death was spontaneous or induced, and that because the mortality was a past event, it was uncertain the respondent was re-

siding in a crowded household at the time of the occurrence.
The previous studies alert us to the possibility that human crowding may have some effect on the frequency of sexual relations, on the desire for additional children, on the effective use of birth control, and on the extent to which offspring survive. Furthermore, as Booth and Gove have recognized, crowding has a subjective dimension that does not appear in studies of crowding among animal populations. One aspect of the subjective dimension may be called simply "subjective crowding," i.e., the feeling of being crowded, as opposed to the objective reality of being crowded. Subjective and objective crowding are presumably related, but there is not necessarily an isomorphic relationship between the two. A second subjective aspect is the psychological distress that may result from crowded living conditions. Crowding has been viewed by most crowding researchers to be stressful, and we may expect that this distress has some impact on various aspects of reproductive behavior.
It should be noted that however representative the above studies may be of conditions in industrialized countries, they may be less representative of conditions in developing countries. This is so in part because of the differences in the average level of household crowding. While the average number of persons per room is about 0.5 in North America, it is typically much higher in cities in developing countries. In Bangkok, for example, the average number of persons per room is 2.1.
While previous research does sensitize us to a number of concerns and issues, it provides rather mixed and

equivocal findings regarding crowding and human sexuality and.hence gives little specific guidance as to what precisely we might find in a very crowded context, such as Thailand. In part for this reason, we conducted a series of focus group interviews in several neighborhoods in Bangkok prior to designing the questionnaire. Before discussing what we learned from those group interviews, we provide some more general information about Bangkok.
THE THAI CONTEXT
Bangkok represents one of the more striking examples of a primate city. Its population, as recently as 1960 numbering some 1.8 million, now exceeds 6.0 million. As the center of commerce, finance, manufacturing, and trade, Bangkok dominates the entire economic fabric of the country, as indeed it dominates in nearly every sphere of Thai culture--whether it be political, religious, or educational. Bangkok's primacy is illustrated by the fact that, in 1980, Bangkok's population was more than 50 times larger than Thailand's second largest city (Sternstein, 1984, p. 67), and over 60 per cent of the urban population of Thailand resided in Bangkok (Fuller, 1990).
Compared to cities in the industrialized world, families in Bangkok experience high levels of household crowding. In our representative sample of households in Bangkok, less than 1 per cent of households had 0.5 or fewer persons per room. It should be noted, however, that while the level of crowding is high by the industrialized world's standards, there is a wide range of crowding represented in our

sample. There was at least one person per room in over 90 per cent of the households, at least two persons in over 40 per cent, at least three in over 20 per cent, and at least four in over 10 per cent of the households. The average number of persons per room was 2.1, with a standard deviation of 1.3. The average number of persons per 100 square meters was 12.25. To have the same level of household crowding in the United States, a 1,500 square foot home would have 17 people living there.
Hong Kong is often mentioned as one of the most crowded cities in the world. But Bangkok's level of crowding is nearly as great, if not more so, than that of Hong Kong. The population density in Hong Kong is 13,097 per square mile (1986), compared to 9,280 in Bangkok (1987).1 More to the point, the level of household crowding is comparable in the two cities. While the average is 2.1 persons per room in Bangkok, in Hong Kong, according to the most recent data available (1971), the average was 1.9.
Thailand has achieved a substantial reduction in fertility in the past two decades; its Total Fertility Rate of 2.2 indicates that Thailand has now reached replacement level fertility. The Total Fertility Rate is even lower in Bangkok than elsewhere in the country, having recently dropped to 1.6. Thailand, and Bangkok, have also reached high rates of contraceptive prevalence. A recent
1If we consider only the relatively densely settled parts of each city, we find comparable population densities in Bangkok and Hong Kong. Hong Kong Island had a density of 73,815 per square mile, while the five most densely populated districts in Bangkok, with a combined population of 1.3 million in 1987, had a density of 70,880 persons per square mile.

study found that nationally, and in Bangkok, about two-thirds of all married women were currently using some type of contraceptive (Chayovan et al., 1988). As noted below, we found an even higher rate of contraceptive prevalence in our sample, in part because by design we excluded married women who had not yet had children. In Thailand, such women are much less likely to be using contraceptives.
By choosing Bangkok as a research site, it was our intention to explore the often speculated-upon role of culture. A number of crowding researchers have suggested that the reactions to crowding may be conditioned by the cultural context (Booth, 1976; Gove and Hughes, 1983). While the level of household crowding in Bangkok is obviously high by North American standards, suggesting that we might find strong effects, there are several cultural factors that could, contrary to this hypothesis, result in finding crowding effects more modest in nature.
First, Thais have a comparatively long history of crowding. Even in rural areas, where land is relatively abundant, similar levels of persons per room are found. This history of crowding may make it easier for Thais to accommodate to high levels of crowding. Second, the tropical climate allows household members to be out-of-doors many hours every day, during all seasons of the year. Living space is not confined to the housing unit itself, but expands to adjacent communal areas. Moreover, in Bangkok, those who work outside the home often work long hours and may have a time-consuming commute to work. This means that some household members are absent during most of their waking hours. The

effective level of crowding may be lower than indicated by a simple "head count." Hence, it is quite unclear whether higher objective levels of crowding necessarily lead to more serious consequences and more deleterious effects. Our findings shed some light on this issue.
As noted above, we conducted a series of focus group interviews before designing the survey instrument. A primary purpose of these group interviews was to ascertain the salience of household crowding, privacy, and related concepts to Thais. The modest demeanor of Thais led us to expect that privacy--especially as it relates to sex --might be a major issue for those living in crowded households. The lack of privacy could lower the frequency of marital coitus and, if persistent, might lead to prolonged periods of sexual abstinence. These group interviews, then, provided some guidance as to what we might expect to find in the survey itself.
Privacy, or the lack thereof, was a recurrent theme in the focus groups, both for the male and female groups. The participants spoke of what it meant to them, the steps they took to try to achieve it, and especially mentioned how the lack of privacy affected their lives with their spouse, including the impact on their sex lives. This is a group of males talking:
Wattana: "I don't think people living here have the activity [sex] during the daytime."
Mongkol: "Yes, it's impossible. Our houses are not private. There is a path in front of the house."
Pen: "Many people passing by. If you close the door, neighbors would tease you loudly outside. Spoil the mood."

And here are excerpts from a dis-
cussion in one of the female groups
when the subject of sex came up:
Chamnian: "When the kids sleep, we can make love."
Sriprai: "My husband is a nervous type. He is afraid the kids will wake up. He works at night, so he has time with me during the daytime."
Malee: "Why don't you just close your door?"
Sriprai: "Even with the door closed, we feel that there are children outside."
The problems posed by having children present came up time and again, particularly in the female focus groups. Many mentioned that at some point-- usually by the age of four or five-- children become aware of the sexual relationship between their parents. This had led to some wives trying to minimize the frequency of sexual intercourse, if not withdraw from the sexual relationship altogether.
Lamjai: "Long before, I wanted to be close to my husband. Now, it's dead."
Chamnian: "It's boring for us, not for them."
Malae: "During the Khao Pansa period [Buddhist Lent, a period of three months], I'll eat only vegetables. I told him not to have sex with me during that period. He said no. He thought that's crazy. It won't work for him--not to have sex for three months."
Sriprai: "I ask him not to have sex one day a week on Buddhist day. But more than that it's not possible for him."
Nim: "Not even one day off for my case."
Malee: "I don't want it with my husband. When he asked for it, I would take a longer prayer and he would fall asleep while waiting for me to finish the prayer. In the morning,

he would ask me 'Did I do it last night with you?' I would then answer 'Of course you did! How soon you forget!'."
It was evident from these conversations, mostly among slum dwellers, that privacy was an important issue, and its lack seemed to be very much implicated in how people conducted their daily lives, including having consequences for their sexual interaction with their spouse. These findings from the focus groups prompted us to explore how crowding, in both its objective and subjective dimensions, might affect the husband-wife sexual relationship and how it might relate to matters associated with their reproductive behavior.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
SAMPLE DESIGN
The population of interest in this study is intact married couples living in Bangkok in 1988 who had at least one child and where the mother was not more than 45 years of age. Since stress plays a central theoretical role in our model and since migration can be a stressful experience, recent migrants (living in Bangkok less than one year) were excluded. Using a two-stage, probability-proportional-to-size, cluster sample design, we selected a representative sample of 2,017 households and interviewed either a wife or a husband in each household. A total of 1,399 wives and 618 husbands were interviewed by trained native Thai interviewers. The response rate was 87 per cent.
Bangkok is divided administratively into 24 districts comprised of a total of

220

150 subdistricts.2 The National Statistical Office (Bangkok) used probability-proportional-to-size (pps) sampling to select 45 subdistricts. Prior to doing so, the districts were arranged by population density in order to implicitly impose stratification by population density. Next, the National Statistical Office used pps sampling to select three blocks from each subdistrict. Detailed block maps showing each housing unit in the sample blocks were used as the sampling frame to randomly select households to be interviewed.
The average household size in our sample is 5.5. The large majority of these households (72 per cent) are comprised of nuclear families, the average couple having 2.1 children. However, extended families of various types are fairly common. Fully 25 per cent of the sample households are three-generation households. A small number of two-generation households in the sample (3 per cent) include not just one but two or three married couples and their offspring.
Lest one should think that our sample design yields an unusually crowded sample of households, we would point out that (a) the vast majority of Bangkok households are comprised of families (only 8 per cent are nonfamily households), (b) very few individuals live alone (1 per cent of persons, and less than 6 per cent of households), (c)
2Three districts which are administratively within Bangkok but which have comparatively low density were omitted from the sampling frame. These three districts, which had only 3.2 per cent of the total population of Bangkok, had a population density only one-fifteenth as high as that for the remaining districts (313persons per square kilometer, compared to an average of 4,690 persons per square kilometer).

the average household size in Bangkok is quite similar to that found in our sample of families (5.1 versus 5.5; the 5.1 includes nonfamily households, which may be smaller), and (d) the per cent of Bangkok family households that are nuclear, as opposed to vertically or horizontally extended, is also quite similar to that found in our sample, 76 per cent versus 72 per cent. (The comparisons are based on census data published by the National Statistical Office, 1983.)
INDEPENDENT VARIABLES
As indicated above, the primary independent variable in this study is 'household crowding, which has both an objective and a subjective dimension. Objective crowding is measured as persons per room, a standard measure of objective crowding (Booth, 1976; Baldassare, 1979; Gove and Hughes, 1983). The subjective aspect of crowding ("perceived crowding") is based on four agree-disagree items, derived from the Toronto study, designed to tap this aspect of household congestion. The items are scaled so that a higher score means the respondent feels more crowded. In addition to the perceived crowding scale, another scale, called "lack, of privacy," also taps the subjective dimension of crowding. The lack of privacy scale was developed by Gove and Hughes (1983) for use in the Chicago study. In most of the analyses presented in this paper, we rely on the perceived crowding scale, but we use the lack of privacy scale in supplementary analyses for the sake of comparability with the Chicago study.

Psychological distress is a third independent variable. As Mirowsky and Ross (1989) point out, psychological distress has two major forms: depression ("feeling sad, demoralized, lonely, hopeless, worthless, wishing you were dead, having trouble sleeping, crying, feeling everything is an effort, and being unable to get going") and anxiety ("being tense, restless, worried, irritable, and afraid"). According to Mirowsky and Ross (1989) and Dohrenwend et al. (1980), depression and anxiety are not clearly distinct forms of psychological distress, but instead are closely intertwined. Tapping the broader concept of felt stress, our measure of psychological distress is a scale comprised of ten items reflecting various symptoms, including aspects of both anxiety and depression. A higher score indicates greater distress.
The specific items that comprise these three scales, along with their alpha coefficients, are shown in Table 1. The items for each scale comprise a single factor, as determined by factor analysis. The scales were formed by taking the unweighted sum of the component items. The scales all have a satisfactory level of reliability, with alpha coefficients ranging from 0.70 to 0.85.
DEPENDENT MEASURES
The ethological literature suggests that crowding may either increase or decrease the frequency of sexual relations. The sparse literature addressing this question as it pertains to human beings is equally equivocal. In order to address this issue, we asked our respondents, "How many times in the past month did you and your husband/

wife have sexual relations?" For the minority of respondents who could not remember the number of times in the past month, we asked for the number of times they had sexual relations in the past week and extrapolated this number to obtain a monthly estimate.
We were also interested in whether the respondents perceived that crowding had any effect on their frequency of sexual relations. We accordingly asked, "Are you ever reluctant to have sexual relations because the children or others are at home?"
Another issue that the literature sensitizes us to is whether crowding leads to the cessation of sexual relations (Edwards and Booth, 1977). To obtain information pertaining to this issue, respondents were asked, "Have you and your husband/wife ever stopped having sexual relations for a period of time for any reason other than pregnancy?" If so, we ascertained the reason for this cessation and how long it lasted.
As Gove and Hughes (1983) suggest, parents who are more crowded may be less likely to desire additional children. In order to examine this aspect of reproductive wishes, we inquired, "Do you want to have any more children in the future?" Closely related to the desire to have, or avoid, additional children is the use of birth control. Respondents were asked several questions pertaining to birth control. First, "Are you or your husband/ wife currently using some family planning or doing something to avoid a pregnancy?" Those who were using some form of birth control were then asked, "How often do you forget to use your method of birth control?" (often,

that crowding may affect child survival and fetal survival. To measure these aspects of reproductive behavior, we inquired, "Did you have any children who died?", "Have you (has your wife) ever had a miscarriage?", and "Have you (has your wife) ever had an abortion?" As Knodel and his associates have pointed out (1987, p. 89), abortion is illegal under most circum-

stances in Thailand and is believed by most Thais to be contrary to the principles of Buddhism. For this reason, survey data on abortion must be interpreted with caution.
CONTROL VARIABLES
A number of control variables are included in the analyses because of their potential impact on various aspects of reproductive behavior. Inasmuch as reproductive behavior is related to the stage in the personal and family life cycle, we control for the age of the respondent, the age of the spouse, and the number of years the respondent has been married. Certain aspects of reproductive behavior are related to socioeconomic status, indicating the need to control for the respondent's level of education and family income. The desire for additional children is related to the number of children a person already has; hence, the number of children is controlled. Finally, controls are introduced for the wife's employment status and the overall health of the respondent.
RESULTS
SEXUAL RELATIONS
In the way of background, our respondents, on average, reported having sexual relations with their spouse 4.4 times per month, almost exactly once per week. The reported average varied significantly between husbands and wives. Husbands reported having sexual intercourse with their wives 5.2 times per month, while wives indicated having sexual relations with their husbands 4.1 times per month (Table 2). It

is not clear whether husbands overreported or wives underreported; the pattern nonetheless is consistent with American findings (Kinsey, 1953). Inasmuch as there is a systematic sex difference, sex of respondent becomes an important control variable.
The frequency of marital intercourse varies in a curvilinear fashion with the age of the respondent. Husbands and wives age 25-29 report the highest level of sexual relations (6.4 and 5.4 times per month, respectively). The frequency of sexual relations is lower in the age group 20-24 (5.6 and 5.2), as well as among older age groups. Generally, the frequency of sexual relations is lower the longer a couple has been married. As the results from the focus group interviews suggested, frequency of sexual relations is related to the age of the oldest child. Focus group participants indicated that finding an opportunity to have sexual relations became more problematic after the children reached a certain age. We found that the frequency of sexual relations was significantly lower once the oldest child was at least four years old.
Husbands and wives who have relatively high, but not the highest, levels of education and income tend to have sexual relations more often. Moreover, the frequency of sexual relations tends to be higher for those in better health, especially for husbands. For wives, a similar but smaller trend is noticed. On the other hand, household structure--i.e., whether there are two or three generations in the household, whether there is only one or more than one married couple in the household-- has no effect on the frequency of sexual relations.

IMPACT OF CROWDING ON
SEXUAL RELATIONS
The zero-order correlations between the crowding measures and the measures of reproductive behavior are reported in Table 3; the multivariate results are contained in Table 4. As the zero-order correlations show, none of the crowding measures is significantly related to the frequency of sexual relations (Table 3). Not surprisingly, the multivariate analyses confirm that neither objective crowding nor subjective

crowding has any effect on frequency of sexual relations (Table 4).
Turning to the reluctance to engage in sexual relations because of children or others, a very different result is obtained. This is one area in which the objective level of crowding, as well as subjective crowding, decidedly have significant effects. Persons per room, lack of privacy, and psychological distress are all significantly correlated with such reluctance. Furthermore, the multivariate analyses confirm that all

three variables have significant independent effects on the reluctance to engage in sexual relations.
The zero-order correlations show that objective crowding, lack of privacy, and psychological distress also are all significantly related to the temporary cessation of sexual relations. However, objective crowding has the most robust effect on the cessation. When lack of privacy and psychological distress are added to the multivariate model, they do not have significant impact, but persons per room retains its significance.
Similar results are obtained when perceived crowding is used as a measure of subjective crowding instead of

lack of privacy. Compared to the effects of lack of privacy, perceived crowding has a weaker effect on the reluctance to have sex due to the presence of others, but has a stronger, and significant, effect on the cessation of sexual relations.
IMPACT ON DESIRE FOR
ADDITIONAL CHILDREN
Are crowded parents less likely to desire additional children? The correlations indicate, that parents who are objectively crowded desire fewer children, while subjective crowding is not related to the desire for additional children.

are objectively crowded are neither more nor less likely to want to have additional children. The multivariate analyses, in addition, confirm that neither perceived lack of privacy nor perceived crowding has any effect on the desired number of children.
Using American data, Gove and Hughes found that "crowded respondents are less likely than most respondents to want more children" (1983, p. 94). They did not control, however, for

the number of children the respondent already had. Our analyses of the Thai data show that the number of children the respondent already has is the single most important predictor of whether the respondent wants additional children. Additional analyses of the Thai data indicate that if we omit the number of living children the respondent has, we too would conclude (spuriously) that objective crowding and both measures of subjective crowding

have significant effects on the desire for additional children.
A related concern, for those desiring to limit family size or increase the spacing between births, is the effective use of birth control. Galle and his associates (1972) argued that crowding may impede the ability of individuals to plan and to execute their plans. It is thus possible that crowded parents may be more likely to forget to use birth control, or that the lack of privacy in their homes may more often prevent the use of their chosen method of birth control.
Nearly 80 per cent (N= 1584) of the married men and women in our sample reported currently using some form of birth control. Nearly half of these

(JV=744) relied on either male or female sterilization, a method of birth control that, once obtained, does not require contraceptive planning. For the 840 married couples who were using other forms of birth control, the issue of the effective use of their method is relevant. We explored this issue by using the two items mentioned above, namely, how often the couple forgets to use birth control and whether a lack of privacy ever prevents the use of birth control. The multivariate analyses indicate that neither persons per room nor lack of privacy is significantly related to either item.
The results for perceived crowding are similar. In the multivariate analyses, perceived crowding is not related

228

Edwards et al.

to wanting more children or forgetting to use birth control. It is the case, however, that perceived crowding is significantly related to reports that a lack of privacy more often prevents respondents from using birth control. Overall, though, there is little evidence to suggest that crowded parents are less able to carry out their plans to use some form of birth control.
IMPACT ON CHILD LOSS
The ethological literature, as earlier mentioned, suggests that under conditions of extreme crowding, adult animals do not care for their young as effectively and higher levels of mortality result. We explored these issues by examining patterns in child mortality, miscarriages, and abortion.
The results provide no evidence that either objective crowding or subjective crowding increases fetal mortality or child mortality. Neither persons per room, nor felt lack of privacy, nor perceived crowding is significantly, positively correlated with any of the three dependent measures of mortality. The multivariate analyses, furthermore, do not reveal any positive significant effects of crowding on fetal or child mortality.
Contrary to expectations, our findings suggest that crowding reduces the risk of fetal or child mortality. The zero-order correlations show that both persons per room and a felt lack of privacy are negatively correlated with miscarriage. While these particular effects are not found in the multivariate analyses, the analyses involving perceived crowding do suggest that parents who feel more crowded are less likely to have suffered child mortality and are less likely to report having had

an abortion. It is not clear why crowding would have these apparent effects of reducing mortality. Note, however, that only two unanticipated effects are significant in the multivariate results, and one of these (that pertaining to reported abortions) must be viewed with caution. There is, in sum, little evidence that objective or subjective crowding affects fetal or child survival either positively or negatively.
As a final consideration, we looked at the possibility that men and women might react differently to household crowding in terms of their sexual and reproductive behavior. To examine this possibility, sex interaction terms were used. None of the sex interaction terms for persons per room, felt lack of privacy, or psychological distress was significant. The effects of household crowding on sexual and reproductive behavior, it would appear, are similar for Thai men and women.
CONCLUSIONS
The level of objective crowding is four times as high in Bangkok as it is in North America. If household crowding has any effect on reproductive behavior, its effect in a context with such a high level of household crowding might be especially discernible. The objective level of crowding--persons per room--does have a significant effect on certain aspects of sexual behavior. Although persons per room is not significantly related to reported frequency of sexual relations, those who live in objectively more crowded households do sometimes have greater reluctance to engage in sexual relations because of the presence of others, and they are more likely to have had periods of tern-

porary cessation of sexual relations with their spouse. However, those who live in objectively more crowded households are no less likely to want additional children, are neither more nor less likely to use birth control, are no more likely to forget to use their method of birth control, and do not feel that the lack of privacy prevents them from using birth control. Moreover, objective crowding, we find, has no effect on fetal and child survival.
The results pertaining to perceived crowding are similarly mixed. Parents who feel more crowded are more likely to report that they are sometimes reluctant to engage in sexual relations because of the presence of others and that lack of privacy sometimes prevents them from using birth control. Contrary to some prior research, those who feel more crowded are less likely to report that they have ever stopped engaging in sexual relations for a period of time, and they are less likely to report having suffered a child loss.
Felt lack of privacy affects only one of the measures examined. Individuals who have a greater felt lack of privacy are more often reluctant to engage in sexual intercourse. Otherwise, a felt

lack of privacy has nosignificant effects on any of the measures examined.
Perhaps more surprising than theeffects that crowding has are the effects that crowding does not have. Ouranalyses show that in Bangkok, where the fertility is at a relatively low level but where household crowding is high, household crowding does not reduce the desire for children. Fortunately, household crowding does not seem to impede the effective use of birth control, nordoes crowding significantly affect fetal or child survival. Our findings suggest that, overall, household crowding, both in its objective and subjective dimensions, has a very selective--and generally modest--impact on sexual and reproductive behavior, if it has any consequences at all.
