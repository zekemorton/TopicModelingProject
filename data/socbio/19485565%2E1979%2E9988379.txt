ABSTRACT: There has been no reported systematic attempt to quantify the relative unique contribution of multiple social and biologic maternal characteristics to birth weight and gestational time among mothers of differing childhood socioeconomic backgrounds. We examined this issue in three nativity cohorts from a population of 766 black prenatal clinic patients in New York City using a series of stepwise hierarchical multiple regression analyses. Different variable sets contributed to birth weight variance in each group, although total variance explained was similar for the three. Since the foreign-born cohort represented a different higher childhood socioeconomic background, but was similar to the other groups in current SES, the differing observed associations of variable sets to birth weight may be related to childhood socioeconomic status. In all groups, social factors show more effect on gestation among births more than 2,500 grams than for smaller babies and thus account for more total explained birth weight variance for births over 2,500 grams.

There have been several multivariate studies which investigated associations of both social and biological factors with birth weight (Kaminski et al., 1973; Wiener and Milton, 1969; Weiss and Jackson, 1969; Ganguly etal., 1972; Rantakallio, 1969). Most of these have emphasized the biological variables in the analysis. Only one, the Rantakallio study, included childhood social factors in the analysis. None of these studies attempted to deal with the time sequence in which the factors would be expected to operate. By not allowing for the logical time order of effects in multivariate analyses, the influence of childhood factors may be un-

derestimated because of their correlation with other factors accounting for larger proportions of variance in the dependent variable. In terms of prevention, however, it seems important to understand the influence of the earliest links in a causal chain, particularly when, unlike many of the biological factors, they may be modified by intervention.
We have presented associations of social and biological characteristics of the mother with infant birth weight from our study of three nativity cohorts of black women (Valanis and Rush, 1979). Foreignborn blacks were found to have higher birth weights and longer gestational time

The variables in each set were selected from among the larger number of social and biological variables included in the Prenatal Project data. Selection was based on two major criteria:
1. Variable was associated with birth weight in the literature.

following information:
1. R2 change--the variance added to the regression equation by the entrance into the equation of that particular variable or variable set.
2. Cumulative R2--total cumulative variance accounted for at each step of the analysis.
3. Simpler--zero order correlation of an independent variable with the dependent variable.
4. Partial r2--represents the unique variance of a given independent variable. Since it is not discussed in reference to each table, a more complete discussion follows.

adjustment formula causes such severe shrinkage of the R2 that it becomes uninterpretable in comparing results across groups. Since this study is concerned with comparing which variable sets are contributing more to the regression equation relative to the other sets across nativity groups, use of the unadjusted cumulative R2 is meaningful. The reader must bear in mind that the total variance in the dependent variable predicted by the regression equation cannot be taken as real due to the differences in sample size of the groups. What we are interested in is the similarity or dissimilarity in patterns across groups, i.e., whether the same variables contribute birth weight variance in all groups.
The partial r2 values in tables in this section are a measure of the variance accounted for by each variable when all the other variables are controlled. Thus, it is a measure of the unique variance contribution of a variable. Comparison of the partial r2 value of a variable with the R2 change when the variable was added to the regression equation gives some sense of how much of the effect of that particular variable is due to covariation with or confounding by some other variable(s). For example, in the sequential regression data

presented in Table 3, for the New York City group, education adds 1.8 per cent variance to prediction of birth weight. The partial r2 value for this variable indicates that its unique variance contribution to birth weight is only 0.7 per cent. Education apparently operates through or covaries with some other variables which may come later, perhaps nutritional intake. For smoking status in the foreign women, the R2 change and partial r2 are the same, 3.3 per cent. Apparently, smoking exerts an independent effect on the birth weight in this group. Still other variables such as gestation at delivery and prepregnant weight show a larger value for unique variance than for R2 change. Obviously, relationships among the variables in this study are exceedingly complex.
RESULTS
BIRTH WEIGHT REGRESSION: TOTAL SAMPLE
The total amount of variance in birth weight explained by the five independent variable sets ranged from 35.4 per cent for the New York cohort, to 40.8 per cent for the southern women (Table 2). Social factors (childhood and current) made a variance contribution when entered of 6.2 per

cent, 4.5 per cent, and 7.6 per cent respectively in the New York, southern, and foreign groups. The entry of health behaviors added 8.2 per cent variance to the equation among the foreign born, but only 2.6 per cent and 1.6 per cent for New York and southern women. Even biological risk factors contribute differently among the groups, adding 11.5 per cent among the foreign-born contrasted with 5.4 per cent among the New York cohort and 4.2 per cent among the southern women.
Table 3 lists those factors within each

variable set which add more than 1 per cent variance to the equation at the time they were entered. While there is some overlap across groups, there are many variables which make a contribution of this size in only one nativity group. For example, planning the pregnancy appears to contribute only in the foreign-born group. Education of the pregnant woman, whether or not she has an occupation (subject's occupation), and whether or not she knows her father's occupation (father's occupation), all make contribu-

supplement adds 2.3 per cent variance to birth weight in the New York City groups.
The most striking difference in the three nativity groups in this analysis is the difference in the proportion of variance accounted for by gestation at delivery. This factor is often used as a control varia-

the same multiple regression analysis was done substituting gestation as the dependent variable.

accounted for 18.2 per cent more of the variance in gestation for foreign women than for the New York City women, and 15.6 per cent more than for the southern cohort. In the foreign group, the variable set making the largest addition to R2 was current social factors (14.4 per cent). Outside of the control set, subject's education and recruitment category are the two largest contributors. Subject's education adds 8.5 per cent variance, and recruitment category adds 3.6 per cent. Recruitment category was also important in the New York City cohort. It was the only variable which added 1 per cent variance for this group. Size of town in which the women grew up and welfare status were the important factors for the southern group.
BIRTH WEIGHT AND GESTATION
REGRESSIONS: SUBSAMPLE OF BIRTHSOVER
2,500 GRAMS
Analysis of only those births over 2,500 grams should make the New York City and southern cohorts more homogeneous for birth weight and gestation and thus more similar to the foreign group. As can be observed in Table 6, both mean birth weights and standard deviations are more similar for the three cohorts. For gestation, however, while standard deviations are reduced from those of the total births,

similar differences remain between groups for both mean gestation and variability of gestation.
The regression analysis for birth weight using only births over 2,500 grams shows major differences in the amount of variance explained by the five variable sets, with 19 per cent and 21 per cent respectively in New York City and southern births and a high of 47 per cent for the foreign cohorts (Table 7). For all groups, as may be expected, the treatment and mediating factors contributed a smaller R2 change than in the analysis on the total sample. For the New York City and foreign groups social factors (childhood and current) both showed a greater effect than in the analysis on the total sample, but there was essentially no difference in the R2 change for this set in the southern group. Health behaviors and biological risk factors continue to be stronger contributors to birth weight variance for the foreign-born than for the other groups. The specific variables in each set contributing more than 1 per cent variance are shown in Table 8. Five of the eight variables in the Current Social Factors set and both variables in the Childhood set have contributed more than 1 per cent variance for the foreign-born cohort. Gestation at delivery continues to be an important fac-

which factors add the most to the gestation variance has altered in this analysis. Whereas in the total group regression on gestation, the current social factor set added twice as much variance as any of the other sets, in this regression, childhood and current factors add equal variance and the treatment and mediating set adds 3 per cent contrasted with 0.9 per cent previously. A similar pattern emerges for the foreign cohort.
Within the variable sets, four of the same factors are adding more than 1 per cent variance for the foreign-born cohort (Table 10), while several factors are new. Father's occupation, triceps and average weight gain, husband's occupation and subject's occupation have dropped out. For the southern cohort, the variance added by town size stays the same, while age, marital status, and complement now add at least 1per cent variance. New York City has added sex of baby, father's occupation, marital status, subject's occupation, prepregnant weight, and average weight gain to recruitment category as the

individual variables adding more than 1 per cent variance to gestation.
It is expected that the improved prediction of gestation by the social and biological variables in the over 2,500 gram groups should be reflected as a decreased contribution of gestation to the prediction of birth weight. Indeed, this is what is observed. If we compare the R2 values from Table 2 to those in Table 7, we see that the change in birth weight variance contributed by the addition of the fifth variable set containing gestation is reduced from 20.8 per cent to 5.0 per cent in the New York City cohort, from 30.5 per cent to 10.2 per cent in the southern cohort, and from 9.9 per cent to 3.2 per cent in the foreign-born cohort.
The cumulative R2 for each successive variable set up to risk factors is similar for the total and over 2,500 gram analyses for the New York City and southern cohorts, reaching an R2 of 14 per cent in the New York cohort for both analyses and 10 per cent and 11 per cent respectively for the southern cohort.

model representing relationships seen in this study are shown in Figure 1.
Biological indices of early nutrition (height) and nutrition at conception (triceps and prepregnant weight) show almost no association with childhood social status and a relatively weak association with current socioeconomic status in this study population. This lack of association contrasts with most reports in the literature and is likely related to the truncated distribution of these biological factors in the study sample. That associations of social class with the biological indices of nutritional status were stronger in the foreign-born cohort, which had wider variation in social class and less truncation on biological variables, suggests that in a more normally distributed group relationships commensurate with those reported in the literature would exist. The biological indices do show a direct association with birth weight. This might be expected since the women were selected on these factors to be at high risk of low birth weight.
In this population, as in the Aberdeen studies (Baird, 1954; Illsley, 1955), and a study by Drillien (1957), childhood social status is associated with current socioeconomic status, although the association here is less strong. This is probably

due in part to the problems of measuring childhood status in this study. The more traditional index, father's occupation, is weak because a large percentage of women did not know their father's occupation. Also father's occupation in this study did not reflect well the educational aspects of social class in the native-born cohorts. In these groups, the jobs held by fathers were often not commensurate with man's educational attainment. Knowing or not knowing one's father's occupation appears to be important. Mother's occupation is no more useful a measure than father's occupation since a high proportion of women were housewives. Despite these problems, some association does exist between the two variable sets, childhood and current socioeconomic status.
Childhood socioeconomic status is also associated with health behaviors. In the two native-born cohorts, childhood status seems to relate to different health behaviors than does current status. More overlap is observed for the foreign cohort. Childhood factors, current social status, and health behaviors all appear to relate to weight gain and gestation. Childhood social status, in particular the variable representing knowledge of father's occupation, shows a unique contribution to variance in birth weight only in the New York
