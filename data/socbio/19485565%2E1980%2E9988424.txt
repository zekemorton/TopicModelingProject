ABSTRACT: Some demographers have argued that post-World War II mortality declines in the lessdeveloped countries (LDC's) are not associated with economic and social development because of the diffusion of health and medical techniques from the developed to the underdeveloped countries. This paper examines the current relationship between socioeconomic development and mortality levels in 124 countries, 94 of which are LDC's. The argument is tested with a path model consisting offivemultidimensional and three unidimensional indicators. Results indicate that for the LDC's, there is a very strong set of direct and indirect relationships between indicators of socioeconomic development and mortality. Between 62 and 80 per cent of the variances in the crude death rate, infant mortality, and life expectancy are explained in the LDC model. The empirical test of the model demonstrates that lower mortality levels in the LDC's are dependent on socioeconomic factors and health services; continued improvement of socioeconomic levels in the LDC's will result in further mortality declines. For comparative purposes, the same model also is tested for more developed countries. Results for the model with more developed countries (MDC's) show that entirely different measures are necessary for MDC mortality models; the concept of "mortality" for LDC's and MDC's is orthogonal and requires different empirical indicators.

The large mortality declines experienced during the past few centuries by what now are regarded as the developed countries usually are attributed to the interactive effects of socioeconomic development and the many advances in medicine and public health. Both health and medical technology and socioeconomic development (primarily income-related factors) worked together to produce declines in mortality (infant/child and general) and increases in life expectancy.
In recent years some demographers have argued that the rapid mortality declines experienced by the less-developed countries (LDC's), especially since World War II, are disassociated from social and economic development because of the diffusion of vast amounts of health and medical techniques and information from the developed countries to the LDC's (Coale,

1973; Stolnitz, 1955,1956,1965; Petersen, 1975; Demerath, 1976; Wrong, 1977; see also Schultz, 1976). Goldscheider (1971, pp. 116-117), for example, argues that the independence of social and economic development from rapid mortality declines has characterized LDC's since the 1930's.
It often then is postulated that the clear-cut one-to-one relationship between socioeconomic improvement and mortality reduction no longer is observable, but research has produced mixed results (cf. Gray, 1974; Adelman, 1963). The policy implications of this possibility, given the known linkages between socioeconomic development and fertility, and between fertility and mortality, in the LDC's (cf. Chang et al., 1979; Ridker, 1976; Heer, 1966; Adelman and Morris, 1966) are enormous and serious if the question of what the relative importance of so-

cioeconomic development is in contributing to mortality declines in the LDC's is not explored (cf. Schultz, 1976). While socioeconomic development and mortality declines may have been relatively independent of one another earlier this century, does this independence persist today? Have LDC mortality rates declined to a point where future reductions may be dependent upon social and economic development in addition to the diffusion of health and medical technologies (cf. Fuchs, 1976, cited in Schultz, 1976)? To this end, the purpose of this brief study is to investigate the relative importance that socioeconomic development and health services have for recent mortality levels in LDC's. A relative comparison is made to more-developed countries (MDC's) to clarify the differences that exist and examine commonalities in mortality determinants these two country groupings may share. A path model of factors affecting mortality is described below and tested with a sample of 94 LDC's and again for 30 MDC's.
THE MORTALITY MODEL
Figure 1 illustrates a brief theoretical model of causal relationships between socioeconomic improvement variables and mortality. It is proposed that socioeconomic factors will have definable effects on LDC mortality levels. These effects will be shown by significant networks in the proposed model.
Five multidimensional and unidimensional variables are selected as determinants of mortality. Economic development and educational level are proposed as exogenous variables. Living standards, health services and nutritional diet are proposed as endogenous variables. The measurement and expected signs of relationships among variables are described below. Similar linkages are described in

greater theoretical detail by Goldscheider (1971) and Chang et al. (1979)
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (ECON)
Economic development, or industrialization, has been a major factor related to declines in crude death rates and infant mortality rates and increases in life expectancy (Goldscheider, 1971). Measured in this study by energy and newsprint consumption, economic development is expected to relate negatively to crude death rates (CDR's) and infant mortality rates (IMR's), and positively to life expectancy. It also is expected that economic development will relate positively to health services, living standard, and diet and nutrition (Berg, 1973; Mclntosh, 1975; Turnham, 1971).
EDUCATION (EDUC)
Education, a major socioeconomic indicator, is a major mortality inhibitor. It is expected, like economic development, to be negatively related to CDR's and IMR's, and positively to life expectancy (cf., Chang and Pendleton, 1978). Education then is expected to be positively related to living standards, health services (Chang, et al., 1979; Chang and Pendleton 1978), and diet nutrition (Mclntosh, 1975). Education is measured unidimensionally as the per cent of adults in the country who are literate.
LIVING STANDARD (LIVI)
The living standard of the country is reflected by the composite of the number of radio receivers per thousand members of the population and the number of telephones per thousand members of the population. It is expected to be positively related to health services and diet and nutrition. Living standard should be negatively related to the general and infant measures of mortality, and positively related to life expectancy.

HEALTH SERVICES (HEAL)
Measured by the combination of population per bed and population per physician, better health services should reduce infant and general mortality and increase life expectancy (Kusukawa, 1967; Eldridge, 1952; United Nations, 1963). According to some scholars, health services should be of much greater importance than indicators of socioeconomic development (economic development, education, living standard, and diet and nutrition) in determining indicators of mortality (crude death rates, infant mortality rates, and life expectancy).
DIET AND NUTRITION (DIET)
Malnutrition was an associated or underlying cause of 57 per cent of the child mortality in thirteen Latin American countries (World Health Organization, 1974). Improving diet supplementation programs significantly reduced child mortality in Peru (Baertl et al., 1970).
Diet and nutrition, measured here as a composite consisting of average calorie intake, per cent animal origin from calories, and per capita intake of protein, also has been found to play an intervening role between education and mortality (cf. Bengoa, 1974; Friedlander and Silver, 1967). It is expected to have a positive effect on life expectancy.

crude death rate. The three measures are purposefully not summarized as a single variable to retain the policy commitment of this research.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data for 124 countries were collected for the analysis; 94 are LDC's and 30 are MDC's. The countries are listed in Table 1.
Path analysis was performed to test the direct and indirect relationships among the variables in the proposed model as shown in Figure 1. Standard least-squares multiple regression analyses with pairwise deletion were made of the proposed linkages in the path model. Significance was found when the standardized coefficient was at least twice its standard error. Insignificant paths were dropped and the model then was retested (Duncan, 1966). This was done for the model with the LDC sample (N=94) and with the more developed countries (N=30). Table 2 provides a summary of the variables and dates and sources of data. Data are mostly from the mid-1970's.
A direct comparison of the variables which consist of different measurement would be misleading. Therefore, z-scores were computed for every variable before conducting the path analysis. The formula for z-score transformation is
X.-~X

MORTALITY

Three separate measures of mortality are used: crude death rates (CDR), infant mortality rates (IMR), and life expectancy at birth (LE). Although other studies (Preston, 1975; Fredricksen, 1968) have used only one variable to measure mortality levels (e.g., death rate, life expectancy) three measures will be used in this study to compensate for the weakness of using any single variable alone, such as the

where the mean of each variable is subtracted from each observation for that variable, then divided by the variable's standard deviation, and summed for all observations. The z-scores for each variable then are added together and divided by the number of variables used in constructing the scale to form a single value for each country. Scales were constructed for economic development, living stand-

ard, health services, diet and nutrition, and life expectancy. The three unidimensional concepts are education, crude death rates, and infant mortality rates.
RESULTS
The zero order correlation matrix for LDC's is shown in Table 3. All of the independent variables are significantly associated with the dependent variables in the expected directions. Knowledge of these bivariate correlations, however, cannot fully explain or document the effects of the socioeconomic and health service variables on the three measures of mortality. Ordinary least squares regression equa-

tions were constructed as described earlier in Figure 1 and used to examine the path network. Displayed in Figure 2 and detailed in Table 4 are the results for the revised mortality model when applied to LDC's.
Of the 23 described paths (Figure 2), 12 are significant. Of these 12 significant paths, 11 are in the expected direction. Somewhat surprising is the positive effect diet has on the CDR (ß = 0.22). This is, however, the second smallest coefficient.
Examining the relationships among social improvement variables, significant results have emerged. Economic development has a positive effect on living standards (ß = 0.30). Higher educational

Economic development (ECON) has no direct effects on the mortality varia-

bles, but exerts an indirect influence through living standards (LIVI). Education (EDUC), theother exogeneous variable, however, not only has a directmortality-inhibiting influence on all three mortality indicators, its effect is the

strongest in all three cases. Living standards provides secondary influences onall three dependent variables while health (HEAL) and diet and nutrition (DIET) exhibit a relationship to CDR's. According to the model, 78 per cent of the variance inthe crude death rate isafunction of health service, living standards, nutritional diet, and educational level. Sixtytwo per cent and 80 per cent of the variances in infant mortality rate and life expectancy, respectively, areexplainedby living standards andeducation.

As indicated by the correlation coefficients among the dependent variables, and as would be expected, the mortality indicators of CDR's, IMR's, and life expectancy, provide asetting within which the others relate; they provide anenvironment for each other.
Results found when the mortality model was placed within the context of more developed countries at first look rather surprising. Displayed in Figure 3 is a rather odd-looking revised mortality model for MDC's. Table 5 presents the

As shown in Figure 3, only two causal paths were found for the mortality model in the context of MDC's. None of these paths lead, directly or indirectly, to mortality.
The correlation matrix, however, shows a number of factors related, inthe hypothesized direction, to the threemor-

tality variables. CDR's are related to economic development (r=-0.16) andliving standards (r=-0.18) but not significant. Associated with infant mortality and life expectancy are economic development, education, living standards, and health, all in hypothesized directions.

The LDC's model indicates that crude death rates are associated directly with educational level, health services, living standard andnutritional diet; infant mortality and life expectancy are influenced directly by living standards andeducation. Economic development is the only variable in the model that does not show any direct relation with mortality. Its indirect effect, however, is exerted on mortality through living standards.
These significant results in the path model indicate that, for LDC's, socialand

economic development is necessary for better mortality conditions. The argument that mortality levels remain independent of socioeconomic advances in LDC's does not withstand an empirical test. Some earlier research using different measurements of socioeconomic conditions support our finding. Preston (1975), for example, suggested a change in mortality in LDC's had occurred in the relation between mortality and national income. Fredriksen (1971) provided evidence that economic development, by increasing per capita food consumption, was an important cause of the observed mortality decline in Ceylon after World War II.
Although mortality declines may have occurred independent of socioeconomic advancement in the past, as some researchers have earlier posited, such independence no longer is an accurate concept of what factors affect current LDC mortality.
Nutrition and diet has an unexpected positive effect on the crude death rate; it has no effect on infant mortality and life expectancy. It probably implies that in LDC's, nutritional status is not determined exclusively by diet, nor is diet determined by the availability of calories of protein (Preston, 1976, p. 13). Other factors, such as infectious diseases, have to be taken into account as sources of malnourishment. Gordon (1969, p. 218) sug-

gests that diet alone does not fully explain the prevalent malnourishment in LDC's. Daily calorie consumption was found to have an insignificant effect on mortality in LDC's between 1940 and 1970 (Preston, 1976). The positive effect found of nutrition on crude death rates in this study suggests that further scrutiny of the relationship between nutrition and mortality is needed.
The proposed directional paths did not develop in MDC's in the present research. It seems, as would be expected, that mortality in MDC's is a phenomenon totally different from mortality in LDC's. Our measurement of socioeconomic development in LDC's includes variables like energy and newsprint consumption, adult literacy, radios and telephones, bed and physician availability, and calorie and protein intake. While variability in these still is extreme in many LDC's, most MDC's findmost all adults to be minimally literate and eating relatively well, most all households containing radios, telephones, minimally acceptable levels of health care, and so on. In other words, "development" in the MDC's should tap into the quality of what these concepts include as well as the quantity. Simple bed and physician availability, for example, is a sufficient health technology indicator in LDC's, but an MDC health concept would need to know the quality of medical and health care,
