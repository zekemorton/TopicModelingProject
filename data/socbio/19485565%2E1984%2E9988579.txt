ABSTRACT:This review presents a comprehensive survey of the literature on mate selection and non-random mating in man. The topics discussed include: (1) genetic aspects of non-random mating for complex traits; (2) evidence on resemblance between spouses on a large variety of traits such as intelligence, personality, physical characteristics, and sociocultural traits; (3) a critical review of sociological and psychological theories offered to account for assortative mating, and (4) implications of assortative mating for marital satisfaction. It is suggested that the factors leading to choice of marriage partners need to be studied from the point of view of multivariate profiles rather than single traits. Such studies will require sophisticated methodologies of research design and data analysis.

"Well, when a guy picks out a dame for himself he's in love with something in himself that hasn't got nothing to do with the dame. She looks like his mother, or she's dark and he's scared of blonds, or maybe he's getting even with somebody, or maybe he ain't quite sure he's a man and has to prove it. Fella that studied stuff like that told me one time--a man don't fall for a dame. He falls for new roses, and he brings his own new roses. The best marriages are the ones pulled off by someone that's smart but not sucked in."
Sweet Thursday John Steinbeck
This review of mate selection deals with a topic of concern to geneticists, sociologists, psychologists, and anthropologists. The fact that the topic of nonrandom mating is relevant to so many disciplines is an indication of its complexity. Theories on mate selection have been formulated at the genetic level, at the societal level, and at the individual level, since the 1800's. There has been a great deal of interest in recent years (Zonderman and Vandenberg, 1977; Price and Vandenberg, 1980; Watkins and Meredith, 1981). The most recent

review by Theissen and Gregg (1980) limits itself to the genetic implications, while the latest review dealing with social and psychological implications was published in 1972 by Vandenberg. The present paper is an updated comprehensive survey and discussion of the literature on mate selection dealing with major implications of positive non-random mating.
The review consists of five sections: In Section I, genetic and sociobiological implications of assortative mating are discussed. Section II covers evidence of homogamy between marriage partners for a range of variables, including age, religion, socioeconomic status (SES), education, mental retardation, personal habits, and personality traits. Section II also reviews evidence for complementariness in mate selection and empirical data for other, less popular, theories of non-random mating. Section III presents a variety of sociological and psychological theories in a review of investigators' attempts to understand the mechanisms behind assortative mating. Section IV presents implications of as-

sortative mating for marital satisfaction. Finally, a general summary includes ideas for future research on mate selection.
A discussion of assortative mating requires familiarity with terms used to describe types of non-random mate selection. We have included, at the end of the article, an appendix with short definitions of terms that appear in the mate selection literature.
I. GENETIC IMPLICATIONS OF ASSORTATIVE MATING
Since assortative mating in man deals with complex traits, it is reasonable to assume that there is little mate selection for traits determined by single genes. Indeed, Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer (1971) have stated that "there are almost no examples of assortative mating in man for simple genetic markers." Therefore this discussion is not concerned with non-random mating and single gene effects (for an excellent discussion on this topic see Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer, 1971).
For polygenic characters, in the absence of differential fertility, positive assortment (1) increases the frequency of genotypes that result in more extreme phenotypic traits, thus increasing variance of the trait in the population (negative assortment decreases the population variance), and (2) increases parent-child and sibling correlations (Crow and Felsenstein, 1968). According to Jensen, (1980), assortative mating is expected to increase only slightly the amount of homozygosity in a population, leaving the mean value of a trait unchanged. Crow and Felsenstein (1968) also suggest that "unless the number of loci is small or the degree of

assortative mating is very intense, there would be only a very slight increase in homozygosity." In their opinion, there should be a much larger effect on the population variance, due to linkage disequilibrium.
The genetic effects of assortative mating may be modified by differential fertility. The evolutionary consequences of differential fertility and assortative mating have been discussed in detail by Eckland (172), as well as by Thiessen and Gregg (1980). Positive assortment with differential fertility may result in a change in gene frequencies and may thus affect the genetic structure of the population in which it occurs (Eckland, 1968). According to Eckland (1972), assortative mating could be higher, for instance, at upper and lower levels of intelligence. He hypothesizes that if fertility is associated with these extreme regions of the distribution, then assortative mating should pressure for natural selection of extremes. In other words, assortative mating would tend to "amplify the genetic effects of fertility and other selection pressures by increasing the genetic variance of the traits assorted for." The example presented in Eckland's paper (1972) deals with intelligence, which is undoubtedly in part genetically determined (Plomin and DeFries, 1980; Bouchard and McGue, 1981).
While Eckland (1972) shows projected graphs of the relative contributions of fertility and mortality to the opportunity for selection, he also states that he knows of "no polygenic model of inheritance which has been developed to account for the joint effects of assortative mating and differential fertility on human evolution" (Eckland, 1972, p. 304).

A. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ASSORTATIVE
MATING AND FERTILITY
Clark and Spuhler (1959) have reported low but consistent correlations between mate similarity for anthropometric traits and fecundity. Spuhler (1967) also presented consistently positive correlations between positive assortment and fecundity for two intelligence measures, Raven's Progressive Matrices and Thurstone's Primary Mental Abilities Test.
There is also some evidence for a relationship between mate similarity in educational attainment and fertility. This will be discussed in more detail in a later section (H.A.2.). On the whole, the evidence on assortative mating and fertility is limited, and to some extent, conflicting.
B . SOCIOBIOLOGICAL THEORY ON
MATING STRATEGIES
According to sociobiological theory (Wilson, 1975), mating strategies which are considered adaptive are those that result in successful gene duplication. Thus, traits in potential mates which maximize one's own gene replication are considered to have high fitness and are targets of mate choice. Since offspring receive 50 per cent of each parent's genetic material, individuals may optimize gene transmission by mating with others who have similar genes, so as to gain in gene duplication without increasing reproductive investment (Theissen and Gregg, 1980).
The concept of fitness implies that the best strategy for gene transmission would be incest, since the expectation of a child from a brother-sister, fatherdaughter, or mother-son mating would be 25 per cent of shared genes (i.e., the

coefficient of inbreeding (F) is 0.25). Thus, it seems illogical at first glance that incestual relations are considered cacogamous in all human societies (Lindzey, 1967). Inbreeding, however, is selected against because of its deleterious effects. Inbreeding increases the probability of producing homozygous, recessive, harmful characteristics, thus increasing the risk of genetic defects in the progeny, especially for single-gene characteristics. For polygenic traits, inbreeding lowers the mean surviving number of the inbred progeny (depending on directional dominance of the trait). This effect is called inbreeding depression (see Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer, 1971).
There is considerable evidence on the deleterious effect of first-cousin marriages on both single-gene-determined and polygenic traits. The outstanding example of a major-gene behavioral trait isphenylketonuria (Stern, 1973). A certain amount of inbreeding depression has also been reported for intelligence in first-cousin marriages (Stern, 1973).
Thus, natural selection against inbreeding depression may serve as the restraining influence on incest (Lindzey, 1967). Positive assortment among nonrelatives may be the genetic strategy to maximize gene representation in future generations while avoiding depression in Darwinian fitness resulting from incest (Theissen and Gregg, 1980).
In accordance with sociobiological theory--as described above--we may summarize that individuals will base their mate choice on gene similarity, up to the point where increased homozygosity will reduce Darwinian fitness. In addition, Theissen and Gregg (1980) predict that in order to capitalize on

families, reported spouse correlations of 0.30 for verbal and 0.15 for spatial ability. Another Israeli sample was studied by Guttman and Shoham (1979) in which 261 couples were given eight spatial tests. In this study the spouse correlations ranged from zero for the Shepard-Metzler Rotation Test to 0.36 for liana Rotations (a rotation test of rule inference which requires mental rotation). In all of the above studies reported, the spouse correlations for the Raven Progressive Matrices were consistently among the highest of the spatial tests: Zonderman et al. (1977) = 0.51; Guttman and Shoham (1979) = 0.33; DeFriesetal. (1976) = 0.22.
McGee (1979) summarized family studies of scores on a number of tests of spatial ability. The mean spouse correlation across all the studies is 0.14, the range being 0,01 for the cube comparisons test (Loehlin et al., 1978) to 0.28 for card rotations (Loehlin et al., 1978).
This review is primarily concerned

with correlational evidence on spouse resemblance and does not go into studies on biometric modelling or the recent papers on path analysis. For discussions on the relationship between these models and assortative mating for intelligence, the reader is referred to papers by L. J. Eaves (1973), Rao et al. (1982), and Cloninger (1980).
Attempts have been made to determine whether observed similarities in intellectual abilities are assorted for at marriage or are a function of marriage duration. In their study (mentioned above), Zonderman et al. (1977) partialed out "nongenetic variables" such as age, sex, years of marriage, and number of children, in order to distinguish between "assortative mating" and "assortative marriage" (see Appendix). Their results indicate that age accounted for a large share of resemblance between spouses on spatial test scores. With regard to other abilities, their evidence suggests that after partialing out

nongenetic factors, correlations between spouses in most of the memory and perceptual speed tests were not changed, and verbal tests were only slightly affected. They conclude that this finding implies that assortative mating, or mate selection, rather than assortative marriage,took place for these abilities.
A different approach is found in the study by Watkins and Meredith (1981), who examined newlyweds' specific cognitive abilities, socioeconomic status (SES), education, and the tendency towards convergence over marriage. They examined 215 newlywed couples with 21 tests of specific cognitive abilities. Watkins and Meredith's data show that correlations of visual and reasoning tests tend to be largest. Those for visual memory are zero, while correlations for spatial and perceptual speed tests range from 0.01 to 0.33. To measure convergence, Watkins and Meredith compared their results from the sample of newlyweds with those of 15 of the same tests, previously administered in the Hawaii Family Study (Johnson et al., 1976) and Zonderman et al.'s Colorado Study (1977). Comparison of these three studies revealed no consistent differences between newlyweds and the "longmarried" couples. Precisely how many years the "long-married" couples had been married, however, was not noted in the Zonderman et al. (1977) study. The mean age of the subjects was 35.4, and the rage of ages was from 17 to 69 years. In the Hawaii study (1976), the subjects had all been married long enough to have a teen-aged child.1
1A study is presently in progress in Israel, conducted jointly by Guttman and Willerman, which aims to compare spouse resemblance of 300 couples of varying ethnic background who have been married from zero to 20 years.

Summarizing correlative findings for spouse homogamy in overall intelligence, spouse correlations range from 0.3 to 0.6 (Jensen, 1978) and are generally higher than those for either personality or physical characteristics (see Sections II.A.3 and II.A.4). Spouse correlations for specific tests of cognitive ability are lower than those for general intelligence. Correlations for verbal and reasoning skills are generally found to be higher than those for perceptual speed or spatial ability (Watkins and Meredith, 1981; Johnson et al., 1976; Zonderman et al. 1977).
2. Education and Fertility.--The correlation between level of education and general intelligence has been reported to be around 0.58 (Bajema, 1966). Guttman and Shoham (1983) computed Pearson correlations between years of schooling of male and female adults, and their performance on eight spatial visualization tests. Correlations ranged from 0.18 for the Shepard-Metzler Rotation Test, to 0.55 for Raven's Progressive Matrices and the Thurstone Test of Analogies.
According to Jensen (1978), the number of years of formal schooling is (second to age) the human characteristic for which there is the highest degree of assortative mating. Warren (1962) collected data on more than 33,000 households in the United States and found husband-wife correlations for education of 0.60 for caucasoids, and 0.57 for noncaucasoids. Warren suggests that education sorts people into demographically separate groups at marrying age.
The degree of positive assortment may have implications for fertility (Bean and Aiken, 1976). Using U.S. census data for 1960, Garrison et al. (1968) and Kiser (1968) showed that larger spouse differences in educational attainment were associated with more childlessness

and smaller family size, although both outcomes appear confounded in their analysis.
Because trends in differential fertility may be dependent on cohort conditions and secular changes, and the studies reported above were done in the 1960's and earlier (before the days of the birth control pill, and when fewer highly educated women pursued careers), these findings will need to be reexamined in the light of data collected in the 1980's.2
3. Personality traits and social characteristics.--Homogamy for spouses' personality traits has been widely studied, and, generally, is represented by small but consistently positive correlations. The typical procedure to check homogamy is to separately ad-

The correlations were generally around 0.38-0.70 for opinions and attitudes, and 0.23-0.45 for the Allport Vernon Scale of Values (Vandenberg, 1972). For personality variables, correlations ranged from zero (selfsufficiency) to 0.34 (neurotic tendency).
A classic study by Burgess and Wallin (1943) on 1,000 couples showed "homogamy in social characteristics" for 45 out of 51 characteristics noted. These included religious affiliation, types of family relationships, types of social participation, courtship behavior, and concepts of marriage.
Spuhler (1967) and Vandenberg (1972) summarize studies of assortative mating for traits like neuroticism, extroversion, dominance, self-sufficiency, hostility, and nurturance. Generally, these correlations have been positive,

and range from 0.02 to 0.29. Tharp (1963) studied "psychological patterning in marriage," and his results also indicated homogamy. In 1967, Cattell and Nesselroade (1967) presented an inventory of 16 personality factor measures to 102 stably-married and 37 unstablymarried couples. Significant positive correlations in the stable group were reported for traits of intelligence, ego strength, surgency, super-ego strength, parmia, autia, radicalism, and selfconcept control. Only two positive correlations, for guilt proneness and radicalism, were found for unstably-married couples, as well as three significantly negative correlations, affectohymia, protension, and surgency. These results will be discussed in Section IV, because they relate to marital satisfaction and homogamy.
Yom et al. (1975) administered the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory OMMPI) to 205 couples married at least five years and found a common dimension of neuroticim and psychotism. Yom et al., however, derived their sample from couples who were obtaining psychiatric services for their children. This is a nonrandom sample and these results cannot be generalized to the general population.
Price and Vandenberg (1980) describe the phenotypic similarity in samples of Swedish and American couples. Swedish couples show typically low correlations on personality variables measured by Eysenck's neuroticismextraversion scale, the Comrey Scale, and others. Significant correlations were found only for locus of control (0.18) and amount of leisure exercise (0.26). Correlations for American couples were significant for traits of trust (0.27), compulsiveness (0.22), social conformity (0.20), general activity (0.22), and

amount of leisure exercise (0.27) and social activity (0.36).
Recently, Eysenck and Wakefield (1981) assessed (among other variables) personality and social attitudes of 566 couples married from one-half year to forty years. Several of these variables will be discussed in the section on marital satisfaction. Here, it is relevant to note that Eysenck and Wakefield report "little assortative mating" for personality variables. Low but significant correlations were found for psychoticism (0.14), neuroticism (0.13) and lie scales (0.26); higher correlations were found for sexual attitudes: 0.43 for libido and 0.41 for sexual satisfaction. Even higher correlations were reported for social attitudes: 0.56 for tender-mindedness and 0.51 for radicalism. Eysenck and Wakefield conclude that "couples select each other for similar sexual and social attitudes and marital satisfaction itself prior to marriage."
Murstein (1980) reviews the data from the 1970's and claims that "assortativeness for marriage continues to be strongly evident, with no variable having been shown to be completely independent of it. The smallest influence of assortativeness has been found for personality and personality inadequacy." Murstein attributes this to courters' lack of access to information about personality characteristics of their potential mates, to misleading premarital behavior when partners try to impress each other, or to inadequacy of methodologies used to assess personality by assigning single, quantitative scores.
Eysenck and Wakefield's (1981) results point to perhaps a more reasonable explanation for low personality homogamy. It is possible that individuals simply do not expect and do not want to marry their "personality clone"; rather,

More recently Watkins and Meredity (1981) found assortative mating for incomes of husbands and wives. Other variables of importance were: parents' income, father's education, overall social class, and occupational prestige of the family's primary wage earner. Watkins and Meredith's results suggest that parental social class variables "play a small role in marital choice, independent of education." Instead, educational level of the mates themselves is the primary SES variable for assortative mating. Earlier data are in accordance with this claim. According to Warren

Since the criteria for defining "overt schizophrenia" in both spouses are rather strict, we have no figure for assortative mating on a range of schizoid traits. If the non-"overtschizophrenic" mates of schizophrenic probands were given personality tests, one might find that of these spouses a certain proportion might show schizoid characteristics, rather than entirely "normal" personality profiles.

One might investigate whether these data are evidence for a cohort effect in the degree of similarity sought in a mate at initial selection, i.e., perhaps couples who married twenty years ago did not marry on the basis of similar leisure time interests, whereas

couples who married more recently regarded similar interests in leisure time activities as an important factor in marriage partner choice. This hypothesis could be checked as an alternative hypothesis to convergence.
B. COMPLEMENTARITY
In 1954 Winch et al. (1954) presented the first serious assortative mating theory alternative to the theory of homogamy. Because of this theory's impact on a great deal of subsequent research on mate selection and compatibility between spouses, we present below a critical discussion of the theory and Winch et al.'s original research.
Winch et al. (1954) hypothesized that although monogamy of social characteristics creates a "field of eligibles," within this field people should choose mates whose pattern of needs is complementary to their own, to provide maximum gratification of their own pattern of needs. Winch et al. consider gratifications from two persons' (A and B) interactions to be "complementary if one of the following conditions is satisfied: 1) the need or needs in A which are being gratified are different in kind from the need(s) being gratified in B; or 2) the need(s) in A which are being gratified are very different in intensity from the same need in B which is also being gratified." Winch et al. decided that some persons are not, while some individuals are conscious to varying degrees of the needs involved in their choice of a partner.
Operationally, Winch et al. used Murray's Need Schema and hypothesized that correlations between spouses would be negative for the same needs and positive for different needs. Winch et al. administered a "need-interview," a case history interview, and an eight-

card TAT to 25 couples, all married less than two years. They regarded their need-interview empirical results as supportive of the prediction that 344 interspousal correlations involving two different needs (like nurturance-succorance, abasement-autonomy, etc.) would be positive, and that 44 interspousal correlations of the same need (like hostility-hostility, deferencedeference, etc.) would be negative. The investigators concluded that "because the data diverge so much from chance in the direction hypothesized, the probability of the correctness of the null hypothesis is virtually infinitesimal. . . . Thus it appears that persons like our subjects tend to select mates whose needs are complementary rather than similar to their own."
There are several problems with Winch et al.'s methodology. In addition to using a very small sample, they did not calculate all of the 1,936 interspousal correlations possible with the 44 subvariables available. Thus, appraisal of this study does not result in conclusive findings.Winch et al.'s findings have not been successfully replicated. Winch himself (1958, 1962) found no support for complementariness when he used the TAT to assess needs (see also Karp, 1970). Vandenberg (1972) points out that negative correlations for the same trait hypothesized by Winch had not been found by earlier authors.
Murstein (1976) discusses in depth Winch's research and mentions several problems both with the methodology used by Winch to support his theory and with some conceptual aspects of the theory itself. First, Winch created a factor bias in the selection of only 15 of all possible needs, so he chose the needs most likely to be complementary. Murstein's criticism may not be justified here. Al-

Murstein further criticizes Winch for his taking the difference of a 0.10 intracouple correlation and a 0.23 correlation for randomly paired couples to indicate complementarity among married couples.

tempted to test complementarity theory, see Schellenberg and Beek, 1960; Barton and Cattell, 1972; Murstein, 1967; Till and Freedman, 1978).
C. MORE COMPLEX THEORIES OF MATE
SELECTION
Subsequent to the theory of complementarity, several further theories of mate selection were proposed and empirically investigated. Goodman (1964) offered a hypothesis that high selfaccepting (HSA) individuals should be attracted to persons like themselves, and low self-accepting (LSA) persons should select their mate on the basis of complementarity. His research extended Roscow's (1957) consideration of self-acceptance as an interveningvariable between latent versus manifest needs, such that self-acceptance indicates an individual's having adjusted to his basic need structure.
To test his hypothesis, Goodman administered the Index of Adjustment and Values and the Edward's Personal Preference Schedule (EPPS) to 75 recently married couples. He found that matesin HSA couples were similar in dominance (r = 0.32), nurturance (r = 0.46), and succorance (r=0.33), while LSA couples showed inter-spousal correlations for dominance (-0.33), dominance and deference (0.33), nurturance (-0.5), and nurturance and succorance (0.47). Goodman warns that the"traditional interpretation of complementarity as based upon all needs is erroneous."
Finally, one should mention here the work of researchers whoclaim that their evidence supports neither homogamy nor complementarity theories andconclude that personality variables may play no part at all in mate selection. Udry (1967) administered personality tests (the 16 Personality Factor (PF)

test) and mate perception tests to 150 engaged couples, whowere followed up over 5 years to determine whether they married or broke the engagement. He reported no differences in personality match between the couples whoeventually did marry from those who did not marry. Bowerman and Day (1956) also found no evidence for a homogamy or a complementary hypothesis after testing a group of engaged couples with the EPPS.
III. SOCIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORIES OF
ASSORTATIVE MATING
Numerous theories, both sociological and psychological, have been formulated in an attempt to explain empirical evidence concerning homogamous, complementary, and other hypotheses.
A. SOCIOLOGICALTHEORIES
Theoretically, perfect random mating should result, for example, in black persons being more likely to marry white persons and college graduates being more likely to marry high-school drop-outs, according to these groups' proportion within the U.S. population (Eckland, 1968). In 1968, however, the racial endogamy rate was 99 per cent, while 50 to 80 per cent of all marriages were homogamous for class. These figures indicate assortative mating for the above traits in the U.S. population. Sociocultural theories attempt to explain the observed continuity of races, religions, and classes in a society by considering variables such as propinquity, social stratification, and class or racial endogamy. These constitute the sociological influences on mate selection.
1. Propinquity.--Clark. (1952) found that more than 50 percent of adults mar-

260

ried in Columbus, Ohio, had lived within 16 blocks of one another when they first met. Today, one might expect that this would not be the case, since people of marrying age, especially college students, are more mobile than they were in the 1940's. Thus, these days we look more at geographical than at neighborhood propinquity.
In either case, propinquity's influence in mate selection is confounded with many other variables such as social class, race, and shared values, since people are not randomly distributed either in neighborhoods or at universities and places of work. An attempt was made to separate propinquity and homogamy of occupational status by Rams0y (1966) in Norway. The study was criticized by Eckland (1968) for equating occupational status of the bride before marriage with her social status. Morgan (1981) used, instead, occupational status of the couples' parents, and she suggested that "segregation provided a structural underpinning to homogamy as a consequence of its effect on networks of social interaction" and that "the residential mosaic (in New Zealand) appears to exert the major influence on the probability of initial contact through its effect on the pattern of social contacts" (p. 919).
More modern studies are required in different socioeconomic groups and geographic areas to assess the influence of changing patterns of mobility on homogamy.
2. Social stratification, class endogamy, and racial endogamy.--Empirical evidence concerning these variables was discussed in Section II.A on homogamy for SES and education. This evidence shows that mate selection is indeed affected by, and also tends to perpetrate, social stratification. Eckland (1968) lists

five explanations for the persistence of class endogamy: (1) persons from the same class tend to marry because they happen to share the same values, and not because they consciously seek out spouses from their own class; (2) the function of distance (whether the person of marrying age resides at his parents' home, at a university, etc.) limits the fieldof eligibles and hence restricts class exogamy; (3) families may put pressure on members to marry someone in their own social stratum; (4) class endogamy persists due to educational advantages or disadvantages of one's family, which to a great extent determines one's place (if any) of higher education (in fact, Eckland refers to universities as "matrimonial agencies"; and (5) a function of the "interlocking nature of class and ethnicity," so that class endogamy may really be ethnic or racial endogamy.
In spite of recent gains by American blacks with regard to desegregation, the number of black-white marriages has not increased to any large extent (Monahan, 1976). Eckland, in 1968, stated that "racial boundaries, from the view of mate selection, appear to be as binding today as at any previous point in history, since the gains that negroes have made in the schools and at the polls during the 1960's apparently have not softened the color line with respect to intermarriage." Eckland attributed this to "cultural and legal prohibitions." Only in 1967, in fact, was the legal prohibition of interracial marriage declared unconstitutional in the United States. Until 1966, only 31 states had legally permitted intermarriage (McLemore, 1980). Eckland also suggested that "certain morphological features, like skin color, actually operate to maintain the color line." According to Beckman (1902), "even if we could eliminate all kinds of

racial prejudice by education, there would probably still exist a discrimination process based on pigmentation traits." In "On the nature of prejudice," Gregor (1961) states that "man shares with the social animals a native predisposition to preferred association," and that "the racial differences act as a focal point for group orientation."
Animal studies on preferred association have emphasized the role of affective communication in social interaction. Pratt and Sackett (1967) raised three groups of rhesus monkeys in three different conditions: (1) one group had contact with peers, (2) individuals in the second group were raised in isolation but with visual and auditory access to one another, (3) and the third group was raised in complete isolation. When all three groups were allowed to associate together freely, the monkeys raised under the same conditions approached monkeys from the same group twice as often as they approached those raised under different conditions. This implies a learned disposition to preferred association with those who share similar patterns of responding. It is reasonable that humans also learn such predispositions, including those for choosing a mate similar to oneself. Thus, assortative mating would tend to isolate groups with shared experiences, and racial characteristics may act as markers.
As far as work done on interracial/ ethnic marriage among humans, Ahern et al. (1981) recently published a study on personality attributes of those marrying within versus across racial/ethnic groups as part of the larger Hawaii "Family Study of Cognition" (DeFries et al., 1974; Johnson et al., 1976). Ahern et al. found that females who married across ethnic groups generally scored higher in dominance than did fe-

males who married within their own ethnic group, whereas men in a high status level (Caucasian) who married crossethnically were lower in dominance than Caucasian males marrying within their own ethnic group. This finding probably reflects hypergamy in mating. Also, both males and females in cross-ethnic matings were generally found to show higher interspousal correlations for personality test scores (i.e., were more homogamous in personality) than males and females who married within their own ethnic groups. This may indicate that only couples who are unusually compatible (assuming that homogamy implies compatibility) bother to brave the social problems involved in crossethnic marriage. Alternately, it could mean that persons with more extreme personality traits, who could be those most likely to break social molds and cross ethnic boundaries in marriage, would be attracted to one another.
B. PSYCHOLOGICAL THEORIES
1. Psychoanalytic theory of mate selection.--Psychoanalytic theory of mate selection is based on the Oedipal configuration (for a review of early development of the Oedipal complex, see Murstein, 1976, pp. 21-25) and hypothesizes that a man should seek a mate who resembles his mother in key characteristics and that a woman's husband should resemble her father. More specifically, boys' and girls' choices of later love objects will be influenced by their different experiences of resolution (or nonresolution) of their early attraction to the opposite-sexed parent.
The boy typically resolves his conflict over jealousy of his father and love for his mother by identifying with his father and repressing his wish for his mother as a love/sex object. His "castration" anxi-

ety" is sublimated to result in an independently functioning super-ego which enables him to later choose a love object of the "anaclitic" type. Anaclitic love is affection for those on whom the infant depends for feeding and care, and is, according to Freud, generally characteristic of men. It is seen in the "man who protects," and in women, more rarely, as the "nurturant woman" (Freud, 1949).
Alternately, the little girl, plagued not by "castration anxiety" but by "penis envy" more gradually identifies with the mother, but "penis envy" is never really sublimated so that the girl's superego never develops to be as strong as a man's. Thus, demands made on her throughout life are harder to deal with and she will tend to seek a mate by narcissistic love-object choice (i.e., the self as a love object) to help preserve the integrity of this ego. The narcissistic type of love is common among women, claimed Freud, and is characterized by a love choice who is (a) what she is herself, (b) what she once was, (c) what she would like to be, or (d) someone who was once part of herself (Freud, 1949).
According to the theory, upon activation of sexual energy at puberty the repressed Oedipal wishes are reawakened, and the adolescent transfers the focus of his sex-wishes toward his opposite-sexed parent onto a girlfriend or boyfriend.
Several problems with Freudian theory of mate choice are immediately apparent. First, it does not specify, though most later researchers on the subject seem to assume, that the completeness of resolution at age 4-6 of the Oedipal complex affects the strength of one's later "reawakening" of the conflicts during puberty. In other words, is mate

choice equally affected by the early Oedipal complex for those who had resolved their complex and successively fused their love for both parents into a love for the family, as for those who had repressed unresolved conflicts?
Second, the "Oedipal complex" itself has been documented only clinically, and there's no reason to assume that it occurs universally to every child. Third, Freud's assumption that normal women are passive, masochistic, and narcissistic, may be based on his observations of a clientele of Victorian Viennese women and cannot be generalized to a different population of women. Fourth, it is not clear from Freud's exposition of the Oedipal stage, why women choose narcissistic love objects because of "penis envy." Also, it's not logical that men, if they develop a tendency toward anaclitic love, need to be the protector rather than the protected. Fifth, how does one measure the degree of resolution of the Oedipal complex? People may very possibly react differently to an unresolved Oedipal conflict. For instance, one man may seek someone who is exactly like his mother, so as to transfer his wishes as directly as possible, while another man might deal with his anger at his mother for submitting sexually to his father by choosing a woman not at all like his mother. Finally, any generalization of "female love" and "male love" is too simplistic to account for the complex pattern of love choice noted by empirical studies.
Despite numerous problems with the Oedipal theory of mate attraction, it has been the theoretical backdrop for many empirical studies, perhaps because it is often noted through informal observation, that individuals' mates do in some ways resemble their parents. It is possi-

ble that Freud's hypothesis ("I want a girl just like the girl that married dear old Dad") may be supported in some instances, but for reasons different from those suggested by the classical psychoanalytic view. We will review here several studies designed to test Freudian theory of mate selection and then will present an alternative theory to account for selection of mates who resemble one's mother and/or father.
Hamilton and MacGowan (1929) found that of 100 men, 17 reported that their wives physically resembled their mothers, and 94 per cent of these men were happily married. Of 60 men who reported no physical resemblance between their wives and mothers, only 20 were happy in their marriages. None of 100 women reported physical resemblance between their fathers and husbands. These results may indicate a sex difference in relevant factors used for mate selection, but the results as they stand are inconclusive.
Commins (1932) approached the problem differently. Based on his belief that "the mother is the boy's first sweetheart, and when he comes later in life to make the choice of a second sweetheart, he will be influenced by the memory image of the first, and he will choose one as near like his mother as possible," he reasoned that oldest sons would marry younger women, since they would have a "memory image" from age 4, of a younger mother. He then inferred that men marrying younger women should themselves be younger than men marrying older women (ages of men were easier to find than ages of women). Commins found statistical support for his hypothesis in the English Who's Who. Of 538 cases, the median age of oldest sons at marriage was 30.64, significantly

younger than the median age of 32.44 for other sons. In 1937, Kirkpatrick, from 768 cases from the Compendium of American Geneology, checked the ages of mothers, sons, and wives, and found no evidence to support Commin's hypothesis.
Mangus (1936) asked 700 college females to rate fathers, other close male relatives, male friends, and ideal mates for interests, roles, and traits. Results showed the ideal mate to resemble the boyfriends more closely than did the fathers or the other male relatives; thus, no evidence was found for the Electra complex.
Winch (1950, 1951) reasoned that young adults with an unresolved Oedipal complex will (1) manifest relatively little progress in courtship, and (2) will have conscious attitudes of preference for the opposite-sexed parent over the same-sexed parent. In his 1950 study he found that sons who said they loved their mothers more than their fathers (or were undecided) were not as advanced in courtship as sons who claimed to love their fathers more. Women, however, who loved their fathers more than their mothers (or were undecided) made better courtship progress than those who preferred their mothers. Winch assumed this to be in accordance with the Oedipal hypothesis, since "to achieve their sex-roles, males must achieve independence, which involves loosening their Oedipal attachments to their mothers; females, on the other hand, need do neither. Rather, they need only transfer their dependency from father to husband, so it does little harm to a woman if she remains in her feminine Oedipus attitude.. . . She will . . . choose her husband for his paternal characteristics. . . ."This assumption is

264

Epstein and Guttman

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:40 08 December 2015

valid, of course, only if one accept the premise that men must achieve independence, while women remain dependent. This premise, to say the least, is not altogether infallible.
Winch's results and conclusions are confusing and unclear. Also, although his idea is interesting, his use of selfreported preferences may not be a sensitive enough measure of the extent of resolution of the Oedipal conflict. Furthermore, as mentioned before, preference for one parent does not necessarily indicate an unresolved sex-wish for either that or the other parent, since reactions to unresolved conflicts may be quite varied.
The literature on psychoanalytic theory on mate selection is quite sparse from the middle 1950's to the middle 1970's. In 1974, Aron et al. (1974) revived the investigation with a hypothesis that in selecting a mate, one seeks to reenact the relationship with the oppositesexed parent. To test the hypothesis, 46 males and 52 females waiting in line at the Marriage License Bureau in Toronto, Canada, were asked to fill out a 12-item questionnaire on their relationship with (respectively) their future spouse, their father, and their mother. Males' ratings of their relationship with their future spouses were generally similar to their relationships with their mothers, especially in the areas of dominance and responsiveness. Females, however, also described their relationship with the future husbands as being most similar to the relationship with their mothers, especially with regard to responsiveness and trust. This indicates that both men and women seek to repeat, in marriage, their relationship with their mothers. The weak role of the father in mate selection is not accounted for here. This study does not support the

Oedipal hypothesis, but does support a more parsimonious theory of parental image, to be presented in the next section. In any case, Aron et al.'s emphasis on relationship rather than trait variable is an important step in testing predictions ofthe psychoanalytic theory.
Recently, an additional article on the psychoanalytic theory of mate selection was published by Jedlicka (1980), postulating physical resemblances of a person's spouse to his opposite-sexed parent. Jedlicka checked ethnicity of spouses of twice-married brides (577) and grooms (403) of mixed heritage parentage and found a "consistent pattern from first to second marriage: males marry into mother's and females marry into father's ethnic groups." These findings contradict Udry's claim that parental images will lose their importance with time and experience with the opposite sex. The findings do support, according to Jedlicka, the psychoanalytic theory of mate selection. Jedlicka does not, however, review the sociocultural variables relevant to ethnicities in Hawaii and thus we do not know if his results are a bi-product of other factors, such as hypergamy. Also, Jedlicka does not relate his findings of mate choice to complexities of psychoanalytic theory. His results, therefore, support only the notion of general parental image influence in mate selection.
A review of the literature on psychoanalytic theory of mate choice shows that little evidence has been found to substantiate the quite specific and complex hypotheses offered by Freudian Oedipal theories, as would be expected in an attempt to empirically validate such a complex theory. A more parsimonious theory of parental image is suggested as an alternative to account for the evidence mentioned above. The nu-

merous problems related to Freudian theory of the Oedipal complex do not weaken the simpler, yet more reasonable, parental image theory.
2. Parental image theories of mate selection.--As was previously noted, it often appears as if people marry someone who resembles their parents, either in striking or in more subtle ways. The question may be asked if this occurs more frequently than would be expected by chance.
Thiessen and Gregg (1980) suggest that individuals may "search out others who fit an unconscious template, presumably instinctual in form . . . others who conform to images of their parents or siblings or who seem to be like themselves." This is in accordance with the "optimal discrepancy theory" of mating to optimize fitness, mentioned in Section I. The strategy would be to select a mate who is outside the family group (to reduce hazards of incest) but who is similar to members of the family. In sociobiological terms, the individuals will attempt to "combine" as many homologous genes as possible by assorting with mates who are similar, while avoiding assortment among consanguineous individuals.
It appears reasonable to offer a hypothesis of mate selection based on parental or sibling images, namely, that individuals seek in their mate choice either to duplicate or reverse earlier relationships, usually from one's family, since these relationships probably have been the longest lasting and most influential.
Very few studies have directly addressed the parental image hypothesis. Most related studies, as reviewed here, attempt instead to test the psychoanalytic hypothesis. It is generally found that mates are similar to ones' parents,

but not necessarily to that of the opposite-sexed parent. Strauss (1946a,fr) compared subjects' descriptions of their parents with either their fiances or spouses, on a temperament/ personality check list, and found that the resemblance of both their parents to their partner was greater than that of the parents and randomly paired partners. Using data from personal interviews of 50 women, Strauss concluded that physical resemblances between mate and either parent were not marked, nor were there similarities in opinions and beliefs. As Strauss states, "analysis of interview data, while it supports the general theory that parent-images influence marital choice, does not support the specific hypothesis that the image of the oppositesexed parent necessarily strongly influences marital choice . . . it seems possible to speak of kinds of parentimage influence." Strauss's research merits replication, with a few changes in the methodology. It would be worthwhile to include a measure of the types of spouses' relationships with their parents, to see if satisfying or unsatisfying parental-child relationships influence mate selection in different directions regarding similarity to parents.
Recently, Zei et al. (1981) published data from the tenth Italian census that show that women born to older fathers tend to marry older men. They suggest that this correlation "reflects imprinting on young girls of their fathers' characteristics." It is far-fetched to use these data as evidence for imprinting in humans, but they may indicate some parental influence in mate selection.
A review of the literature shows that research on parental image has not been popular. One reason may involve the difficulties in gathering data from four

266

related subjects (a young couple and a set of parents). Also, personality research generally yields such low correlations, that it is risky to invest in research that may not show considerable differences among couple-parent crosscorrelations.
3. Convergence.--In all assortative mating studies, it is important to be aware of the influence of changes in similarity over years of marriage of spouses' personality traits, attitudes, habits, and even physical traits. This tells us whether mates initially selected each other for homologous characteristics or whether they became more or less similar over years of marriage as a result of the marital experience. Most investigators who have controlled for this variable have not found convergence over years of marriage for interests, attitudes, temperament, and intelligence.
Griffiths and Kunz (1973) found no similarity as a function of years for physiognomic features. In 1977 Zonderman et al. used three multiple regression models to determine whether phenotypic convergence occurs during marriage for cognitive abilities. They found that convergence does not occur. Schumm (1980) administered the Tennessee Self-Concept Scale to 54 married couples and found that the self-esteem scores of spouses correlated moderately (r=0.39) but "did not tend to converge with the length of marriage, supporting the hypothesis that mate selection processes are responsible for the observed similarity in self-esteem between husbands and wives." Unfortunately, Schumm et al. do not note the length of marriage of their couples. Price and Vandenberg (1980) in their study on spouse similarity to American and Swedish couples found "an indication that the observed similarity of spouses for most variables is due to initial assort-

ment rather than to convergence of phenotypes after initial contact." They do mention exceptions, including more highly plastic variables, such as alcohol consumption and amount of social activity. Watkins and Meredith (1981) also report that their data suggest spouse resemblance in activities from the start, and that resemblance changes little over time.
Most recently, Eysenck and Wakefield (1981) found little assortative mating for personality variables, and no tendency for spouses to become more alike on any variable during the course of marriage. In general, then, it seems that any homogamy between spouses, especially for less plastic variables like intellectual abilities, is assorted for initially and is not subject to convergence over years of marriage.
4. Unconscious archetypes.--A less popular theory of a mate selection is mentioned by Eckland (1968). Early scholars believed that for "reasons involving the survival of the species," there must be a particular woman for each particular man. Carl Jung believed that every man has an "anima," an "archetypal form," expressing a specific female image carried in his genes, who "seizes him and he falls in love with her." There are, however, no biological traits known to influence this type of mate selection, and the theory remains an interesting aside.
5. Value theory of mate selection.-- The major proponent of value theory is Coombs (1961), according to whom value theory explains the homogamy tendency and encompasses or supplants theories of propinquity, parental image, complementary needs, and ideal mate conception. He defines a "value" as "any aspect of a situation, event, or object that is invested with a preferential interest as bing 'good,' 'bad,' 'desir-

He also did not specify how people choose partners from within a "field of eligibles" of others who share their values. For a more in-depth review of Coomb's and others' studies on value theory, the reader is referred to Murstein, 1976. Here it will suffice to mention values as perhaps a necessary, but not sufficient, factor in mate choice.

7. Stimulus-value-role theory of mate selection (SVR).--This is a process theory proported exclusively by Murstein (1976). It is an exchange theory which states that "in a free choice situation, attraction and interaction depend on the exchange value of the assets and liabilities each of the parties brings to the situation." Stimulus, value comparison, and role variables influence the development of a relationship, and each is operative at different stages in the course of courtship. The "stimulus stage" is initial

6. Filter and process theories.--In 1962, Kerckhoff and Davis presented a theory of successive filters through which possible mates "pass." From all possible dating partners, only those who pass through the "social background" filter go out together. Then dates with "high consensus" go together, and unless they pass together through the third filter, the "complementary filter," they do not consider one another as a possi-

attraction in an open field coupled with appraisal of one's capability (assets) to attract the "stimulus object." During the "value comparison stage," each partner assesses the other's attitudes, religious orientation, interests, etc. If there is value compatibility, the couple passes to the "role stage," in which each partner compares his perception of what the other's role should be, to the other's behaviors, and vice-versa.

Hisisa sequential process theory that requires more empirical support, using samples of more diverse subjects. A longitudinal study would probably best suit the testing of a process theory like this.
8. Ideal mate theory.--This theory holds that an individual eventually marries the person who most closely resembles his image of the ideal mate. This theory is based on Kelly's theory of interpersonal perception (Kelly, 1941), which states that "the actual relativepositions of the (spouses) on a personality trait continuum are not as important in determining compatibility as the belief of the husband and wife regarding their relative positions on these scales."
Udry (1967) tested 90 engaged people to see whether ideal mate imagesactually influence mate selection andconcluded that "ideal mate images are probably of little importance in mate selection; neither are they a salient feature in the perception of the selected mate." Udry, in 1967, examined 150 engaged couples for personality traits and mate perception and then followed up on the couples for 5 years to check the statusof the relationships. He found no contribution for personality match, accuracy of mate perception, or perception of mate similarity for either sex.
Karp et al. (1970) found evidence from a study of 50 engaged couples to support the hypothesis that a mate will be seen as resembling the subject's ideal self rather than the actual self, where the actual self differs from the ideal self. This indicates that interpersonal perception does indeed influence mate selection, but may operate more on the person's ideal-self than on his desire to match an actual mate to an ideal mate he may have imagined.

These studies unfortunately to not define the factors involved in formulating an "image" of the ideal mate. This would be useful in determining both why people look for certain traits in a perspective partner, and why evidence fails to support the hypothesis that ideal mate images influence mate choice.
9. Instrumental Theory.--Centers (1975) proposed the "instrumental theory" of mate selection: "in the intersexual dyad formation each person seeks, among his circle of acquaintances, within the compass of his selfacknowledge compeers, to form a relationship with that person or those persons whose behavioral and other resources provide (or are perceived to provide) maximum gratification and minimum punification for his needs." Centers introduces the concept of"genderic congruity," which states that those needs most typical of men should be most correlated with needs highly typical of women.
Centers found the biggest need differential in the Edward's Personal Preference Schedule (EPPS) among his sample of 71 engaged individuals to be between dominance for men and affiliation for women. He thus hypothesized that these needs should be most highly correlated for pre-marital couples, that is, highly dominant men will be attracted to affiliatory women, and viceversa. Centers indeed found a high cross-correlation (0.50) between male dominance and female affiliation. In addition, he reported a high intracouple correlation for sex (0.64), and affiliation (0.56). He also had predicted, and found, that for couples in which the man was low in abasement, the interspouse correlation for achievement (0.44) was significantly higher than that for couples in which the man washigh in abasement need (-0.01).

This theory differs from Winch's complementarity theory in that Centers' predicts complementarity between different needs, rather than negative correlations on the same need. Murstein (1980) points out that Centers' data are sometimes incorrectly analyzed and that his theory is sexist. Even so, "genderic congruity theory" advances beyond the simplicity of Winch's theory, and further investigation would most likely contribute to the study of mate selection.
10. Matching hypothesis.-- Sociologist Erving Goffman (1952) once stated, "a proposal of marriage in our society tends to be a way in which a man sums up his social attributes and suggests to a woman that hers are not so much better as to preclude a merger on a partnership in these matters." The "sum of social attributes" refers to a person's level of social skills, attractiveness, and "possession of other socially-valued characteristics."
More recently, Berkowitz (1974) has applied Goffman's theory to the matching hypothesis of mate selection. This hypothesis represents another example of more recent researchers' tendency to study the process of mate selection (courtship and dating behavior) rather than correlational data on married couples. Berkowitz predicted that the process of assortative mating will probably be the next area most intensively studied by mate selection researchers.
IV. ASSORTATIVE MATING AND MARITAL SATISFACTION
The study of mate selection, in addition to being inherently interesting because almost everyone eventually marries or at least engages in courtship, is also applicable to practical domains. Information gleaned by mate selection re-

search can be used by marriage and family counselors to deepen understanding of the factors involved in marital satisfaction, or lack thereof. There exists a voluminous literature on the quality of marital relationships; in fact, according to Spanier and Lewis (1980), "marital quality and related concepts . . . may be the most frequently studied variables in the field." Testimony to this is the existence of a journal expressly devoted to marital dissatisfaction--The Journalof Divorce!The scope of our paper here enables us only to touch briefly on various theoretical and methodological issues involved in the study of marital quality, and on the relationship between assortative mating and marital satisfaction.
Marital satisfaction is usually defined operationally, that is, either as lack of marital dissatisfaction, or as that which is measured by marital satisfaction scales. McNamara and Bahr (1980) summarize the major studies done on marital quality as being based either on a bipolar pleasure/pain model (satisfaction less dissatisfaction), a unipolar model (satisfaction alone), or a "separate dimensions" model. McNamara and Bahr themselves studied 1,618 couples to assess "role satisfaction and possible role satisfaction detractors." Their results tend to support the third model, since they find that lack of role stress and role conflict do not necessarily result in role satisfaction. As usual, the more complex formulation seems to be the most applicable in dealing with such a complex phenomenon.
Other definitional problems with marital satisfaction include the typical lack of distinction between marital quality and marital stability. Researchers (Hill, 1976, for example) often use the number of couples still married after X number of years as a measure of high

270

Epstein and Guttman

Social Biology

marital quality, when in fact nothing but marital stability should be inferred.
Also frequently assumed is that lack of conflict indicates marital satisfaction, whereas a conflict-ridden relationship must reflect unhappiness in marriage. Absence of conflict, however, may not be as important a factor in marital satisfaction as the way in which a couple resolves conflicts. Adequate conflict resolution may be more influential for a healthy happy marriage, than not dealing with problems and avoiding conflicts.
It is also important in marital satisfaction research to consider the nonstatic character of marital quality. Schram (1979), for instance, presents a curvilinear model where marital satisfaction decreases after the birth of the first child, reaches a plateau ("launching stage"), and then increases during the post-parental stage. He cites reasons for the post-parental rise in marital satisfaction as perhaps being due to age correlated effects, in increase with age of social desirability, the greater tendency to report happiness the longer one is married, or finally, the effects of lessening sex role constraints as age increases. Another reason may be that in crosssectional research, marital satisfaction studies on middle-age subjects are looking essentially at "successful" or stable marriages, since many unsuccessful marriages have by that time already ended in divorce. This assumes, of course, that stability equals success, but it is fair to guess that the more extremely unhappy marriages have dropped from the sample.
A review of the literature on marital quality shows that several researchers have attempted to deal with the abovementioned definitional methodological problems. Several models of marital satisfaction have been offered, but a clear

framework has not yet emerged to guide the study of marital satisfaction. One such attempt at theorizing was made by Lewis and Spanier (1979) who introduced four major factors which act as vectors on the marital dyad to result in high or low quality and stability in marriage: tensions, attractions, alternative attractions, and external pressures. These are inter- and extra-dyadic forces of which "the ultimate costs and rewards, pushes and pulls . . . will determine the quality and stability of marriage." Offering a related hypothesis, Udry (1981) has recently reported that the dimension of marital alternatives (as defined by the existence of potential extramarital partners or spouse replacements) "appears to be a better predictor of marital disruption than is marital satisfaction." Since marital alternatives correlate positively with one's resources, it is reasonable that "lack of choice" would encourage partners to make the best of their marriage, if they can't "do better."
The reviews of Spanier and Lewis (1980) and of McNamara and Bahr (1980) deal with recent theories of marital satisfaction, some of which have been briefly discussed above. We now turn to a more specific discussion of nonrandom mating for characteristics which may influence marital quality.
In 1935, Terman and Buttenweiser found that couples who shared similar professional interests reported greater happiness than couples who did not share professional interests. Benson (1956), on the other hand, concluded that engagement success and marital adjustment were not based on the couple's common interests, but that value consensus in "familialistic" (as opposed to "individualistic") areas was related to engagement success.
Also in the 1950's, several research-

ers (Preston et al., 1952; Dymond, 1954; Corsini, 1956; Luckey, 1960) found that congruence between self-perception and perception by the spouse emerged as a predictor of marital satisfaction. These findings prompted subsequent authors to investigate satisfaction in social roles and social identification. According to Tharp, (1963), "role theory provides the best available framework for investigation of psychological phenomena in marriage," and role-specific needs, not general personality traits, should be studied in research on marital satisfaction. Tharp went on to claim that "marital happiness is greater when both couples conform to conventional sex roles." Tharp's work needs to be replicated, since his findings could very well be cohort-specific, and changeable with more modern, less rigid, sex role expectations.
Cattell and Nesselroade (1967) found significant disassortative mating in their "unstably married" group, for the traits "outgoingness" (-0.50), enthusiasm (0.40), and self-sufficiency (-0.32). In stable marriages the wives tended to be more introverted and the husband more extroverted, and vice-versa for the unstable marriages. All in all, on 16 personality traits, the stable group showed 10 significantly positive correlations, and the unstable group had, as mentioned, 3 significant negative correlations and 2 significant positive correlations (guilt proneness and radicalism). These results support the hypothesis that homogamy for personality between partners encourages marital success, as defined by a couple's making no known step toward marriage dissolution.
Using a bi-polar adjective check list, the Locke-Wallace Marriage Adjustment Scale (LWMAS) (Locke and Wallace, 1959), and the Edmond's Marital Conventionalization Scale, Murstein

(1972) found that personality similarity was significantly correlated wth marital adjustment (but these correlations were no greater for perceived similarity than for actual similarity), that selfacceptance was significantly correlated with marital adjustment, and that accuracy in predicting the partner's response was significantly correlated with marital adjustment, as was role compatibility. Alternately, Weigel et al. (1973) found no relationship between congruence of spouses' personal constructs and marital success., evaluated by LWMAS. They attribute this finding to the lack of a significant correlation between spouses on the Locke and Wallace Scale and suggest using a more accurate indicator of marital success.
In their longitudinal study of marital success and failure, Bentler and Newcomb (1978) attempted to see "which personality traits, brought to the marriage by each partner, affected the subsequent outcome and quality of that marriage four years later." Bentler and Newcomb used the Bentler Psychological Inventory and the LWMAS. Their results supported their hypothesis that still-intact couples will have shown, from the beginning, more similarity on personality traits and background items than did separated or divorced couples. They found weaker support for the hypothesis that the still-married couples will show greater peer-self agreement than couples of unsuccessful marriages. Their data show that divorced and married couples face qualitatively different problems. Divorced couples, for example, had significantly greater problems with sex relations, lack of mutual affection, bickering, selfishness, and desire for independence.
Bentler and Newcomb's study is very useful in that its longitudinal paradigm can successfully measure convergence

between partners and can also give a more accurate account of possible factors predictive of marital success. They present a clear picture of homogamous and divergent traits which may influence marital stability and quality.
Physical attractiveness and marriage adjustment (measured by the LWMAS) in older American couples was studied by Peterson and Miller (1980), who found that physical attractiveness of wives contributes to their husband's marital adjustment, whereas the husband's attractiveness was less important for the wives' marital adjustment. These findings indicate that the same factors may have different degrees of import on men and women for marital satisfaction and should be further studied.
Locus of control is another variable which appears to be related to marital satisfaction. Doherty (1981) found marital dissatisfaction to be greater in marriages in which the wife had more "external locus of control" and the husband more "internal locus of control." Doherty suggests that such cognitive personality variables be used to study the relation between homogamy and marital satisfaction.
Finally, Eysenck and Wakefield (1981) have reported that sexual behavior and spouse similarity in sexual attitudes variables contributed most heavily (62 per cent for sexual behavior and 42 per cent for sexual attitudes) to the variance of marital satisfaction. Similarity in background (25 per cent) and personality (20 per cent) contributed moderately, and social attitudes (5 per cent) had little effect. The data also show that the similarity effect accounted for only 2 per cent of marital satisfaction variance. Eysenck and Wakefield conclude that marital satisfaction would best be studied by independently assess-

ing each partner's contributions to the marriage, rather than by examining patterns of similarities or complementarities. Also, the role of sex in marital satisfaction should be further explored, since the two sex variables accounted for most of the variance in Eysenck and Wakefield's study.
The research on marital quality is ridden with methodological and definitional problems, some of which have been mentioned. The lack of a generally accepted definition of marital satisfaction has resulted in different operational definitions and measurements. Researchers in the field have become aware of this problem, and several attempts, to date none conclusive, have been made to provide theories of marital satisfaction.
V. SUMMARY
Assortative mating, in combination with differential fertility, tends to increase the genetic variance of traits assorted for; this can alter gene and genotype frequencies of the total population. Assortative mating without differential fertility will not necessarily change gene frequency in the population's gene pool, but will result in more extreme phenotypic traits, thus increasing the population variance for specific traits over that of panmixia. Thus, when assortative mating for a trait is correlated with fertility, the consequences are magnified, so that the trait becomes more extreme and isolated, increasing chances for selection.
Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer (197) point out that the use of observed correlations between mates for predicting effects on genetic variation is complex because of the effects of secular trends.

They add that removal of the secular trends from the correlation, as well as removal of the fraction due to nongenotypic correlations between socioeconomic status, presents considerable difficulty.
According to sociobiological theory, positive assortative mating may be the optimal strategy to duplicate one's genes and therefore increase one's inclusive fitness while avoiding deleterious effects of inbreeding.
As far as empirical studies reported in the literature for spouse similarities, in general, interspouse correlations for intelligence are higher than those for personality and physical traits, but lower than correlations for background characteristics such as age. Homogamy for sociocultural characteristics is, on the whole, more pronounced than for psychological traits. The evidence shows that assortative mating for personality traits is not random; the many correlational studies done to date have yielded no definite conclusions as to which personality variables are most highly correlated among married couples.
Theories such as complementarity between spouses have not been strongly supported by experimental data. Winch's findings and methodology are reviewed and found to be lacking in reliability. More complex theories have been tested in an attempt to remedy the over-simplistic character of previous theories. These studies are interesting and this line of research should be pursued. Generally, however, the more complex the paradigm, especially in personality research, the more confusing and inconclusive the results. This is a ubiquitous problem with personality research, and new methodologies need to be introduced to this area.

The third section of this paper reviewed a series of sociological and psychological theories to explain assortative mating. In general, sociological theories can account for the field of eligibles from which we pick our mate, but beyond this, do not deal with mate choice within the field of eligibles.
A variety of psychological explanations were presented, including psychoanalytic theories, parental image theories, convergence, Jungian, value theories, filter and process theories, the SVR theory, ideal mate theory, instrumental theory, and the matching hypothesis. A survey of the research from the 1940's to the 1980's indicates a trend from pure descriptive studies of similarity and complementarity to what have been called "process theories" such as those offered by Kerckhoff and Davis (1962) and Murstein (1976).
The final section of this paper deals with assortative mating and marital satisfaction in an effort to pinpoint characteristics which, when similar between spouses, influence marital quality. Problems inherent in studying marital satisfaction, a thus far operationally defined concept, are reviewed. Here again, personality research proved to result in inconclusive and conflicting data. More reliable measures of marital satisfaction are needed before successful attempts can be made to assess influential factors on marital quality.
It is clear that, at this point, reasons for assortative mating are not fully understood, despite the many studies done over the past eight years. Most of these studies have been descriptive and have not served to separate co-varying factors in mate selection. Several questions, such as the relation between assortative mating and fertility, and assortative mating for psychoses, remain almost en-

tirely unanswered, since different studies have yielded such varying data.
Future research will need to deal with the interrelated factors leading to one's mate choice. Such research will require the simultaneous construction and analysis ofcomplex trait patterns or profiles. Guttman's Facet Analysis (Shye, 1978) presents a relevant methodology for theory construction which is based on careful facet design on the one hand and on well-tested multivariate, nonmetric procedures ofdata analysis on the other. This approach is especially useful for the simultaneous analysis of complex trait profiles.
The longitudinal study is of course the best strategy for studying mate selection and changes in resemblance of marriage partners. This method ismore accurate than the cross-sectional study, but presents a variety of technical problems.

In all research onassortative mating, one needs to consider that assessment of direct assortative mating for a trait under study (religion, for example) may be confounded with assortative mating for an associated character (i.e., ethnic background), cohort effects, or secular trends. In collecting and analyzing empirical data on assortative mating, and in testing suggested theories ofmate selection, care needs tobetaken to separate simultaneous multivariate factors in order to avoid misjudgement of the relative importance of biological, psychological, and cultural inheritance.
