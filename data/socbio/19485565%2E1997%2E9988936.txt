ABSTRACT: Births while on public assistance has been one of the central topics in the welfare debate in Maryland because the welfare grant increases with the number of children, and there is debate about whether or not to continue the increased income provision. Based on the Quality Control (QC) data for the period from July 1991 to June 1992, this study examined differentials in the incidence of births conceived and borne while the mothers were on welfare. The results indicate that about one-quarter of recipient children were born on welfare and that higher incidences of these births occur among mothers with less than high-school education, never-married, young, Baltimore residents, and with fewer children at entry on welfare. The presence of parents of welfare mothers or of any adults in the household is found to reduce the incidence of births. Disallowance of the increased welfare grant for additional children may increase the number of families in poverty and the number of children in foster care unless efforts are made to reduce unintentional births and school drop-outs and to fill the gap between mothers' schooling and the needs of the job market.

Controversy still continues on the issue of fertility of welfare mothers in general, and the occurrence of births while on welfare in particular. Policymakers and the public in general tend to assume that women on welfare have large numbers of children, and many contend that because benefits increase with the increase in the number of children, mothers on welfare have a financial incentive to bear more children.
Contrary to this assumption, research findings in Wisconsin demonstrate reverse results, that welfare mothers have lower fertility rates than nonwelfare mothers (Rank, 1994, p. 74; 1989). A similar study by the Washington State Institute for Public Policy (1992) demonstrated that family income fell further below the federal poverty line as the number of children in a household increased, and that there was

no statistical difference in the birthrates of women receiving public assistance and women not receiving public assistance. Schultz (1995), with break-down by race and age, observed a significant negative relation of AFDC benefits with fertility for white mothers of ages 12-24 and an insignificant relation with black mothers. The AFDC families with unemployed parents for both races, except at ages 1524, showed a negative but insignificant relation with fertility, which was even stronger among blacks.
As noted by Phillips and Fronstin (1993), for mothers who are already on Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the promise of receiving more benefits does not enter into any decisions they make about having another child. Acs (1993) argues that the cost of raising a child is substantial, and the amount of

91

money a mother would receive would hardly defray that cost. High benefits may instead influence a mother's decision to participate in AFDC, but not her decision to have a child.
On the other hand, Lundberg and Plotnick (1995) provided a mixed picture of economic incentives of public policies in relation to becoming a teenage unwed mother. White teenagers were found to be positively responsive to the changes in welfare, abortion, and family planning policies; black teenagers were found indifferent to such changes. Although they did not advocate a strong causal relation, they did argue that economic incentives influence adolescent premarital childbearing in addition to social, cultural, and attitudinal factors. Thus, a great deal of controversy exists among planners, policy makers, and researchers on this issue. However, the issue here is not whether welfare mothers have higher fertility than others, rather it is the issue that births increase public expenditures.
In Maryland, as in many other states, the issue of additional births while on public assistance continues to be one of the central topics in the welfare reform debate. In the existing system, the amount of the AFDC grant increases with additional children, which in turn increases the state expenditures for welfare. If the present system, for instance, remains unchanged, a mother with two children receives $162 more a month than a mother with one child, which includes AFDC, food stamps, and energy/heating (Code of Maryland Department of Human Resources, Title 07, Chapter 02; Staveley, 1994). The grant starts at the birth of a child and continues until the child starts earning or reaches age 18. This large public expenditure certainly explains the gravity of the problem.

To reduce such expenditures, the Governor's commission on welfare and the Maryland State administration reviewed two proposals among others--one was not to increase the AFDC grant for any additional children while on public assistance, and the other was to relax the abortion laws for mothers on welfare and to promote knowledge and practice of family planning (Governor's Commission on Welfare Policy, 1994). The underlying intention of the former was to provide a disincentive to having births while on welfare by not increasing the monthly grant. The latter one was to facilitate the former strategy of reducing unwanted births by providing adequate means and services for abortions. Under the existing system, a woman qualifies for terminating a pregnancy with Medicaid funds only when she is the victim of rape or incest or that pregnancy poses a serious threat to her mental or physical health (Frece, 1995). Consequently, abortions for unwanted births other than those reasons are not permissible by law, which limits access to the relevant facilities, in turn resulting in higher numbers of unwed mothers and unwanted births among low-income women.
Obviously, additional births of children of AFDC mothers increase public expenditures. We need to see the problem from different angles. Why did these mothers decide to have additional babies while they were on welfare? Was the decision voluntary or involuntary? If the decision was voluntary, was it for completing a desired family size when there is no immediate prospect of getting off welfare? Was it with the intention of fostering as well as sustaining strong interpersonal relationship between the partners through having additional births? Or, was

Vol. 44, No. 1-2

it for obtaining a larger monthly grant? If the decision was involuntary, did the recipient mothers have adequate knowledge about the use and availability of contraception and adequate means to purchase contraception? Without clear understanding of these issues, it is difficult to pin down the potential points where policy interventions are likely to curb the likelihood of births to women on welfare. To have a clear understanding of such decision-making processes, we need a specially designed survey with a focus on these issues. The available sources of data preclude such in-depth analysis.
Within the limitations of the given data source, this study attempts to evaluate the prevailing incidence of births on welfare and its socioeconomic differentials. It also attempts to evaluate the timing of first birth after entry on welfare and the major risk factors for having births after entry on welfare. Specifically, we intend to test the following hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1.--The higher the level of education, the lower the likelihood of having births while on welfare. Education is negatively related to age at first childbearing (Weeks, 1993) and to family size. Since better-educated mothers are more likely to get off welfare, they tend to refrain from having additional children while on welfare and look forward to a life off welfare and self-dependency. In addition, educated mothers have better knowledge about available methods of contraception, sources of their supply, and their appropriate and effective uses. This knowledge reduces their chances of unintentional births.
Hypothesis 2.--The larger the number of children at entry on welfare, the lower the likelihood of having births on welfare. Mothers with large number of children at

entry on welfare are less likely to have additional children while on welfare. Having additional children is likely to prolong their stay on welfare and incur more discomfort which is usually not compensated by the amount of enhanced grant for additional children (Rank, 1994). Besides, many of these mothers may already have completed their desired family size.
Hypotheses 3.--The lower the age at entry on welfare, the higher the likelihood of having births on welfare. Mothers entering welfare at younger ages are likely to be less endowed with human capital (such as years of schooling, training, etc.), which is likely to be a strong hindrance to getting jobs which in turn prolongs their stay on welfare. Perceiving less chance of immediately getting off welfare because of poverty, uncertain economic conditions, and low prospects for achievement, young mothers often become discouraged about making transitions to adulthood through educational and career achievement (Hogan and Kitagawa, 1985). As a result, some mothers might consider completing their desired family size, if they have one, despite their chances of becoming more impoverished.
Hypothesis 4.--Householdcomposition is likely to have some influence on the likelihood of having births. Some have argued that having another adult in the household facilitates childbearing by providing childcare and financial support, while others suggest that the presence of parents reduces childbearing by increasing adult supervision. Hogan and Kitagawa (1985) found that the presence of parents significantly reduced the likelihood of daughters becoming pregnant because parents supervised their dating. We hypothesize that the presence of parents in the household is likely to reduce the chances of a

woman having additional births on welfare. In addition to providing necessary services, as in a time of need, parents do provide motivational support to their daughters toward becoming self-reliant; and to a certain extent their presence reduces sexual promiscuity and the chances of unintentional births, which in turn enhances the welfare mothers' participation in education and job-training programs. The presence of any unrelated adults, if they are live-together partners, has two possible influences on the chances of additional births. On the one hand, the live-together partners may increase the chances of having births if they desire to foster a strong bond in their relationship. On the other hand, live-together partners are evidently more rational in their reproductive behavior than partners not living together and are more likely to have strong motivation to be self-reliant.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
DATA
The data used for this study are the Quality Control (QC) data collected by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for the period from June 1991 to July 1992. The primary use of this data is for HHS to check errors in the AFDC grant assessment. Very few analyses of this data have been done for scientific purposes. Despite some basic limitations of the QC data, it is a useful source for examining characteristics of AFDC recipients that have important significance for policy formulation.
~. METHODS
(a) Current Duration on Welfare.-- The current duration on welfare has been

estimated from the date of most recent opening and the date of review (sample month and year). While the date of recent opening has day, month, and year, the date of review has only the month and the year. Consequently, the estimates of current duration on welfare suffer from an underestimation of an amount ranging from 1 to 29 days. However, this has little impact on our analysis since the duration has been used in years.
(b) Births on Welfare.--In the existing system of Quality Control data, there is no direct information on births that occurred while recipients were on the welfare rolls. However, using an indirect method, this variable has been created. To create it, we used date of most recent opening, date of sample review, and ages of children. First, we estimated the current duration on welfare, and then we matched this information with the ages of children. If the duration is greater than the age of any own-children, we considered that child was born on welfare. In this method of estimation, the births that occurred while on welfare but were conceived before receiving welfare (before the date of most recent opening) were not considered as births on welfare. In other words, births that occurred during first nine months since the most recent opening were not considered as births on welfare. In doing so, we encountered some problems because of using zero as the code for the ages of children under one year. Thus, children who were older than nine months but less than one year were considered as births not on welfare because there is no way we could identify their status.
(c) Parity Progression Ratio.--The parity progression ratio (PPR) is the proportion of women who proceed from one parity to the next higher parity, that is, the

proportion of women who have ever borne N+l children among those who have ever borne N children.
MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS: LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL
The logistic regression model is considered here to assess the influence of various socioeconomic characteristics while simultaneously controlling for other variables on the likelihood of births occurring while on welfare. The dependent variable is whether a recipient gave birth to a child while she was receiving public assistance. The variable is coded " 1 " for "yes" and "0" for "no." Since our primary interest was to analyze whether any births occurred while the woman was receiving public assistance, we did not consider the issues of multiple births on welfare. The independent variables are current age of AFDC mothers, race, region, education, marital status, and number of children at entry.
The logistic regression model used in the present study1 may be expressed as:
= P{Y=\) In ( p ) = a +
\-P where Y is the dependent variable, which is odds for having additional children with response categories " 1 "for yes and "0" for "no," a is an intercept, and (3 is a coefficient vector corresponding to the vector of socioeconomic and demographic factors, X.
RESULTS
BIVARIATE ANALYSIS
The results indicate that about onefourth of the families (23.3 per cent) had

at least one birth while on welfare, and about 6.5 per cent had more than one birth (not shown in tables). Blacks differ substantially from whites. While 26.2 per cent of blacks had births on welfare, whites had a lower percentage at 15.2. The percentage of one birth among blacks (19.2 per cent) was much higher than whites (11.9 per cent), as were the corresponding percentages for two or more births at 7.8 and 3.4 per cent, respectively.
To avoid the complexity of the relationship between household heads and dependent-child recipients, we focused our analysis on AFDC mothers who were also household heads which reduced our working sample size from 1,383 AFDC families to 1,178 AFDC mothers. The subsequent analyses are based on these mothers. Table 1 presents socioeconomic differentials in incidence of births. These birth rates are estimated as the ratio of AFDC mothers who had at least one birth while on welfare to the total AFDC mothers. It appears that the incidence of births does not change until the mothers' ages reach about 30, and after that it starts declining, which is true for both racial groups. Regarding the regional difference, the residents of Baltimore show almost two-times higher birth incidence than the other regions. Mothers with high school or more education have about 25 per cent lower incidence of births than mothers with less than high school education. This difference appears to be larger among blacks than whites. Never-married mothers tend to have more than two-times higher incidence than the ever-married mothers. Although marital status does not make much difference between blacks and whites in terms of relative risks, the incidence for having additional births is much higher among black never-married

mothers than among white. This difference is partly mediated through a disproportionate number of married women among whites than blacks. Notable differences are also observed with respect to the status of receiving prior assistance. The birth rate appears to be much higher (about 24 per cent) for those with no experience of receiving public assistance. This difference is because part of the reproductive period of mothers having prior experience is spent outside welfare, and births occurred during that period are not

considered as births on welfare. There may be other contributing factors for such differences.
We have also examined the differentials with respect to family composition. Two basic indicators were used--presence of parents of AFDC mothers and presence of any unrelated adults in the households. Presence of parents as well as presence of any unrelated adults in the household appear to contribute to lower birth rates. These differences are even stronger among whites than blacks.

The parity progression ratios of Table 2 give more insights on the dynamics of the growth of family size by the socioeconomic characteristics of mothers. Comparing the parity progression ratios (PPR's) of mothers having births on welfare with those who have not, the ratio at each parity, in general, is higher for mothers having births on welfare. This finding indicates that these mothers have higher chances of having larger numbers of children than others. Blacks tend to have higher likelihood of having larger family sizes than whites. Among other factors included in the table, mothers in Baltimore, with less than high-school education, with prior experience of receiving public assistance, and of ever-married marital status have higher likelihoods of having larger family sizes.
MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS:
LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS
Table 3 presents the results of logistic regression analysis. From the estimated coefficients for all, it appears that all the variables have significant roles on the likelihood of births on welfare. Mothers of younger ages, not married, black, with less than high-school education and with fewer children at entry are more likely to have births on welfare. The effect of age on the likelihood of births is quadratic. That is, the odds of having births increase until age 30,' which is about one year less for blacks than whites. After that point, the odds of having births significantly decrease as women get older.
1The peak of the parabola (30.1 years) for the quadratic-relationship of age and the likelihood of birth is derived from the following equation:
P/Age = .601 -.02 (Age) =0

Never-married mothers have stronger likelihood of having births than their evermarried counterparts. However, the difference in incidence of births between the marital statuses seems to vary between the panels. In the regions outside Baltimore, never-married mothers are two-and-a-half times more likely than ever-married women to have births while this difference is insignificant in Baltimore. This finding may have resulted from the disproportionate number of ever-married women living in Baltimore. As observed, the percentage of ever-married women in Baltimore was only about 18 per cent compared to about 35 per cent in other regions in the sample under study. These percentages were 20 and 41 for blacks and whites, respectively. Since the majority of AFDC mothers in Baltimore were black, the lower incidence of marriage among blacks is perhaps a primary factor for such discrepancies. High unemployment, low educational attainment, and high poverty in Baltimore may have contributed to the low incidence of marriage and high incidences of births out-ofwedlock and those on welfare. Unmarried white mothers are 83 per cent more likely than ever-married white mothers to have births while the corresponding difference for blacks is about 56 per cent.
With varying strength of relationships across the panels, education shows an inverse relationship with the likelihood of having births. Mothers with a high-school education have 40 per cent less chance of having births. The control of other factors has widened the difference due toeducation than what was found earlier in bivariate settings. Having a high-school or more education makes a substantial reduction in the likelihood of births for blacks compared to whites.

As it appears, the number of children prior to welfare is by far the strongest determinant of the likelihood of births. For each additional child born prior to welfare, the likelihood of having births on welfare decreases by 3.1 times, which are 6.3 and 2.6 times for whites and blacks respectively. That is, mothers entering on welfare with more children are less likely to have births on welfare, and whites have a much stronger negative relation than blacks.
Presence of parents and any unrelated adults show similar relationships as observed earlier. Even after controlling for other factors, we find their presence seems to have significant effects on the likelihood of births. The presence of parents reduces the likelihood by about 40 per cent, which is about 76 per cent for

whites and 28 per cent for blacks. The negative effect appears to be significantly stronger among whites. Again, beyond the dichotomy of presence or absence, the parental characteristics, which is not in the purview of this study, are likely to make profound impact on the mothers' likelihood of having births. A similar type of effect is also observed with the presence of any unrelated adults, but the effect is somewhat lower than that of the parents' presence. It may be noted that prior assistance was included in the initial model, but the result was found statistically insignificant although there was an indication of higher likelihood of births for mothers who did not have prior assistance. It is also relevant to mention that the average interval between entry on welfare and the occurrence of first birth

CONCLUSIONS
This analysis shows that about onefourth of the AFDC families (assistance units) had at least one birth while they were on welfare. Blacks had a substan-

tially higher incidence of births, about 68 per cent, than whites. The incidence of births was almost two-times higher among the mothers in Baltimore than those in other regions of Maryland, which is partly attributable to the disproportionately higher percentage of blacks living in Baltimore. High unemployment, low educational attainment, and high poverty in Baltimore may also have contributed to such a large difference. Mothers with
