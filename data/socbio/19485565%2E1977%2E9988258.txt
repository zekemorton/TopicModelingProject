ABSTRACT: TWO recurrent concepts in fertility literature permit prediction of an inverse relationship between social class and fertility. The commitment to familism refers to the degree that couples embrace a family-centered style of life over a consumerist or careerist style of life. Commitment to individual children refers to the emotional and material involvement of parents in each child they have. Data show that commitment to individual children is negatively related to fertility, that social class is negatively related to commitment to familism, that social class is positively related to commitment to individual children, and that commitment to familism and commitment to individual children account for relationships between class and fertility.

Sociologists who study fertility commonly assume either implicitly or explicitly that married couples, as participants in sociocultural systems, incorporate values of childbearing and childrearing into their personal orientations and that these orientations become important determinants of fertility behavior. This basic rationale guides social scientists who view fertility as dependent on such macrovariables as urbanization, race, religion, and social class. These investigators assume that a modal set of interpretations of family life exists for each of the broad social categories they study.
Other investigators characterize such macro-approaches as expressing a "nature-over-man fatalism" in which human conduct is seen to be unconsciously "in the grip of physical, biological and social forces" (Hill, 1966, pp. 3-4). This second group of social scientists often chooses to conceive of fertility as dependent on such micro-variables as attitudes and husband-wife interaction and communication.

A third approach to the study of fertility assumes that the relationship between broad social structural conditions, interpretations of those conditions by social actors, and consequent action is problematic. Social scientists embracing this last point of view point to wide variations between attitude and action within the broad categories studied by those who subscribe to the macro-approach. They also point to a lack of appreciation of the role that structural factors play in the formation of belief and action by those who subscribe to the micro-approach. In this study, hypotheses are tested that relate fertility, as a dependent variable, to two micro-level variables (personal orientations) and that relate personal orientations as dependent variables to a socialstructural variable, social class.
THEORETICAL MODEL
Two conceptual themes have occurred repeatedly in the literature on human fertility. One theme draws attention to the

18

importance that parents attach to the presence of children in the nuclear family unit. The second theme focuses on characteristic types of action parents take on behalf of an individual child. For example, Judith Blake (1968), in her critique of Gary Becker's economic theory of fertility, suggested that the importance of having children varies with the opportunity costs that arise if a couple does have a family. The notion of a differential orientation to individual children is noted in her suggestion that parents must raise children according to standards set by others. Such standards may be high or low depending on the segment of society that serves as a childrearing model for the couple.
J. A. Banks (19S4) implicitly noted the two themes when he observed that the decline in family size among Victorian middle class couples was partly due to the greater importance of maintaining status relative to the importance of numbers of children in general, and partly to the increasing costs of rearing individual children. David Heer (1968, p. 60) explicitly recognized the two themes in a discussion of mortality:
It may be supposed that the pain of bereavement at a child's death is directly proportional to the amount of emotional energy the parents have invested in that child. Therefore, where mortality levels are high, one might expect the parents in the interest of self-protection to place relatively little emotional involvement in any one child. Since parents have limited amounts of emotional energy, a reduction in mortality, by encouraging parents to place more libido in existing children, should reduce their desire to have an additional child.
The first theme will be called commitment to familism. The second theme will be called commitment to individual children.
COMMITMENT TO FAMILISM
Ernest W. Burgess and Harvey J. Locke (19S0, p. 527) described a familistic

orientation according to five well-known dimensions. They employed the term individualism to refer to a nonfamilistic orientation and maintained that individualism implied low fertility since, at an extreme, a person might not marry and raise a family in order to preserve maximum personal freedom (1950, p. 527).
Reuben Hill (1968, p. 245) proposed that a familistic orientation is most likely to be encountered where the activities of family members are home-centered, in which the family performs a great number of functions for its members, and in which the roles of parents are compatible with the presence of children. Familism thus understood is commonly viewed as a rural phenomenon. William Kephart (1961) has summarized this traditional argument as follows:
Traditional familism, in the sense of lineage, property rights, rejection of outsiders, occupational apprenticeships, complete domination of familial over individual objectives-- such an orientation would seem to have little place in an urbanized, industrialized society (p. S06).
Kephart cautioned, however, that there appear to be strongly-held familistic values in urban American society including those of home centrality, conjugal love, and children.
Along this line, Wendell Bell argued that familism may be characterized by a set of attitudes and actions including "high value on family living, marriage at young ages, a short childless span after marriage, and child-centeredness . . ." (1968, p. 147). According to Bell, this "conjugal familism" emerged as an element of modernization along with two other styles of life: careerism and consumerism (1968, pp. 146-149). In modern American society, married couples have an opportunity to blend together in varying proportions a life style that emphasizes the elements of home and children, career development, and consumption of goods and services.

The implication, of course, is that the degree to which conjugal familism is embraced, to the exclusion of the latter two life styles, the greater the fertility of married couples.
In this paper the focus will be on the type of familism that emphasizes a commitment to the conjugal family. Interest centers on the degree to which a married couple emphasizes having and rearing children over other expenditures of emotional and material resources. A high commitment to familism as understood in this paper refers to a high valuation by a married couple of a way of life that places great importance on the presence of children in the nuclear family unit. A couple with a highly familistic orientation will expend "wealth, leisure and energy . . . on children and other aspects of family living . . ." (Bell, 1968, p. 147), whereas a couple with a nonfamilistic orientation will expend emotional and material resources on a wayof life that is presented as an alternative mode of living by the larger social and economic environment. In American society, alternative modes of living include the careerist and consumerist life styles described by Bell. It is expected that familistic couples will be more likely to have children and more likely to have more children than nonfamilistic couples.
COMMITMENT TO INDIVIDUAL CHILDREN
The birth of a child demands immediate action from those persons who are expected to care for it. From the infantcaretaker relationship there emerges a comparatively strong emotional attachment to and highly valued emotional rewards from infants, a phenomenon Joseph B. Tamney identifies as the "appeal of babies" (1966, p. 80). From older children, parents obtain two other rewards (Tamney, 1966, pp. 84-90). The first, self-extension, refers to the projection of unfulfilled ambitions onto

children. While economic aspirations are perhaps the most common projection, Tamney noted that even death is one kind of failure that the presence of children, to parents, might appear to ameliorate. The second emotional satisfaction that parents obtain from older children is selfexpansion. Self-expansion refers to the parents' gain in understanding of the world through children.
In a cautionary note, Tamney pointed out that self-extension is realized as a parental reward only if couples have control over children and only if other activities allow them the time to assist a child toward the attainment of projected aspirations (1966, pp. 85-87). Selfexpansion is likely to be realized only if parents interact with children as equals; that is, if they interact with children as friends. The reward of self-extension is difficult to realize to the degree that parents lack the necessary control over their children and the knowledge necessary to aid children toward projected aspirations. Self-expansion as a reward, while possible with few children, is in general hard to achieve because friendship "requires time and effort or interest, which is a scarce commodity" (Tamney, 1966,p. 88).
The essential point of the above discussion is that children, although offering a married couple several types of emotional satisfactions or rewards, are also costly, both emotionally and materially. The cost of self-extension is great because a large emotional and material investment must be made in an individual child in order to maximize his chances of actually achieving projected aspirations. Self-expansion is costly in that friendship demands a large emotional investment in another person.
A high commitment to individual children, then, refers to a relatively great quantity of wealth, leisure, and energy a married couple expends on an individual

child. It should be noted that the concept of commitment to individual children does not refer only to love or affection for a child, but also to the kinds of action that parents feel they should take and intend to take on behalf of a child. Moreover, idealization of motherhood, babies, and children is in no way implied in a high commitment to individual children. In general, couples highly committed to individual children may be expected to have fewer children than couples not highly committed to individual children.
FERTILITY AND COMMITMENT TYPE
Theoretically, using the concepts of commitment to familism and commitment to individual children, one might try to predict the fertility of any one couple by employing a simple model that divides commitment to familism by commitment to individual children. That is, given a quantity of emotional and material resources to be invested in childbearing and childrearing, actual fertility would be determined by what multiple that quantity is of the resources that will, on the average, be invested in each individual child.
If fertility should vary by the commitment to familism and the commitment to individual children as just described, couples with similar patterns of commitment may be expected to have similar childbearing and childrearing preferences. Specifically, highest fertility is predicted when there is a high commitment to familism and a low commitment to individual children. Lowest fertility is predicted when there is low commitment to familism and a high commitment to individual children. Moderate fertility is predicted when there is high commitment to familism and a high commitment to individual children or low commitment to familism and a low commitment to individual children.

SOCIAL CLASS, THE COMMITMENT TO FAMI-
LISM, THE COMMITMENT TO INDIVIDUAL
CHILDREN, AND FERTILITY
If it is assumed that fertility is related to the commitment to familism and the commitment to individual children as described in the above discussion, it becomes necessary to account for variation in each of the commitment variables. The notion that expenditures of emotional and material resources may be made in a nonfamilistic direction may be viewed as a recognition of opportunity costs that arise if a married couple does have children, as well as of direct costs of nonfamilistic activity. Blake (1968) suggested that the opportunity costs that occur if children are added to the nuclear unit vary positively with social class. Therefore, to the extent that the commitment to familism is a reflection of opportunity costs, it may be hypothesized that commitment to familism varies inversely with social class. James Beshers (1962, p. 133) noted that high status couples must use a portion of the resources at their disposal to maintain the symbols of their social rank. He suggested that the easier status symbols may be copied by those lower in status, the greater the effort there must be to maintain symbolic distinction (1962, pp. 131-133).
Thus, in general, a high commitment to familism may be less common among high status couples than among low status couples because the former must devote a larger quantity of resources to maintain their relative rank. It should be noted that high status couples whose rank is not dependent on easily copied status symbols, but on ascribed attributes such as family name, may not conform to the general hypothesis. Middle status couples, who must at least differentiate themselves from those lower in status to maintain rank, may also emulate those segments of society higher in status. If this two-fold process of status

21

maintenance occurs, middle class couples might have the lowest commitment to familism of all couples.
It is hypothesized that social class will be positively related to commitment to individual children. Blake (1968) suggested that parents raise children according to standards set by others; and for high status couples, standards are likely to be set by high status segments of society and will more often than not prescribe long periods of dependence for children. As a consequence, high status couples will expend relatively greater quantities of emotional and material resources on each child they have. Beshers (1962) identified the motive behind these expenditures as an attempt to maintain social rank over generations. In general, then, high status parents commit a relatively greater quantity of resources to every child they have to help preserve their own and their children's present and future status.
Clearly, if commitment to familism varies inversely with social status, if commitment to individual children varies

positively with social status, and if fertility varies as hypothesized with each of the commitment variables, a theoretical base exists for predicting an inverse relationship between social class and fertility, at least for those couples whose status is based on achieved symbolic attributes.
The general causal model for predicting fertility from commitment to familism, commitment to individual children, and social class is portrayed in Figure 1below. Signs indicate the predicted direction of relationships. The relationship between class and fertility is predicted to be found through commitment to familism and commitment to individual children and not expressed directly between class and fertility.

sample if they were listed in one of three daily newspapers as having had a baby over a nine-month period. Because over 99 per cent of births in the area take place in hospitals, this method of sampling probably was able to locate most legitimate births in the area. Just over 41 per cent of all couples who were reported to have had babies returned questionnaires. Responding couples represented a wide range of socioeconomic characteristics. Nearly half the sample had only one child; a third, two children; a seventh, three children; and the remainder, more than three children. A majority had used and in the future intended to use some form of contraception.
MEASUREMENT OF THE COMMITMENT VARIABLES
Indicators of commitment.--Although there are many scales that purport to measure the concept of familism (see Straus, 1969; Heller, 1970), none was found that appeared to measure the concept as it has been defined in this research. Most scales have been designed to measure the attributes of familism as described by Burgess and Locke (19S0) and not the "conjugal familism" that is the subject of the present project. Therefore, special scales were devised.
Three types of indicators were used to measure the commitment to familism. One type of indicator sought to determine how often husband and wife participated in activities without their children. The wife was asked to indicate how many times per month she, together with her husband, attended a motion picture, dined at a restaurant, attended club meetings, and attended sporting events. These indicators are based on the assumption that the greater the number of activities a couple takes part in without the children, the higher their commitment to consumerism

and hence the lower their commitment to familism.
The second type of indicator by which the commitment to familism was measured was attitudinal. The wife was asked to indicate her degree of agreement or disagreement with five statements that were designed to measure the importance she attached to nonhome activity and the importance she attached to expenditures of time and money on goods and services that are a part of a nonfamilistic way of life. A sample item is: "It is important for a married couple to be able to travel."
The third indicator used to measure the commitment to familism was the work record of the wife. It was believed that a record of considerable work experience would be indicative of a low commitment to familism. A work index for each wife consisted of a full-time and a half-time component, the former receiving a weight of two and the latter a weight of one. For each year of marriage, the number of months the wife worked full-time times two was added to the number of months she worked part-time. These yearly scores were summed and then divided by the number of years married to yield a score that reflected the average yearly work of the wife.
Two types of indicators were used to measure the commitment to individual children. One type consisted of statements that dealt with the ease with which children could be reared, and the ease with which an additional child could be added to the family unit. Some items were especially written for this research, but many were restatements of comments made by parents that were reported by Rainwater (196S). A sample item is: "A couple can always provide for an additional child."
A second set of indicators was made up of statements that dealt with what the wife thought were "proper" courses of action

are a smaller rather than a greater number of activities. To the extent that wives disagree with the items in the second factor, they may be viewed as expressing a high commitment to familism. The commitment to familism was measured by these two scales, hereafter referred to as Familism I and Familism II.
Commitment to Individual Children I appears to identify a dimension that measures the perceived emotional difficulty of raising children. Commitment to Individual Children II identifies a dimension that appears to measure the length of time that children are expected to be dependent on parents. To the extent that wives agree with the items in the first factor, they may be viewed as expressing a relatively low commitment to individual children. The items that define the second factor indicate a high commitment to individual children to the degree that responses are a greater rather than a lesser number of years. Commitment to individual children will be measured by the items in these two factors, hereafter referred to as Individual Children I and Individual Children II. The work index defined a one-item factor and was ignored in further analysis. Four factor scores were computed for each case using factor score coefficients as weights.
THE MEASUREMENT OF FERTILITY
The social scientist is faced with two problems of validity if he wishes to measure fertility. One problem is particularly acute when fertility is employed as a dependent variable in a study that uses a survey design. In such cases, there is concern with whether or not questions of family size preference "really" measure the future childbearing activity of married couples. This method of questioning is thought to yield responses that predict the average fertility of groups more accurately than it predicts the fertility of individual

couples (Kiser, 1967; Westoff et al., 1957).1
A second problem associated with the measurement of fertility preferences concerns the form of the question. Ryder and Westoff (1969) have analyzed responses to questions of intended, expected, and "really" wanted family size. They found that couples gave almost identical answers to expected and intended questions. They concluded that asking about ideal family size (for the average American family) was of little value unless an ideal was specified for a particular couple under specific conditions. There was a relationship between the various questions, however. They found that each question showed systematic variation between population subgroups. Thus, it appears that different forms of the fertility question, while not yielding identical estimates of future fertility, may yield similar rank orders of fertility when comparing population subgroups. The answers to such questions may be indicative of the shape of a relationship if not of its absolute parameters.
The measurement problem that arises from the first dilemma cannot be fully eliminated. Social scientists must assume that the fertility of married couples is not fixed at any point early in marriage, but varies with changes in their positions in perception of their social environment. Thus, questions of fertility preferences may be predictors of future family size only if such changes are minimal. The measurement problem presented by the second dilemma can be minimized by ex-
1 Even this finding is not conclusive. The Growth of American Families study cited by Kiser did not study the same couples in 1960 that were studied in 19SS. The conclusion of Westoff et al. (1957) may be questioned because of the small size of the sample of couples involved, the historical time, and the fact that couples were only engaged at the beginning of the study.

amining the shape of relationships between fertility preferences and other variables, rather than the absolute levels of fertility yielded by preference-type questions.
Each wife was asked three preferencetype questions which were used to measure fertility. They were (abbreviated designations in parentheses):
1. How many children do you want to have? (desired family size)
2. How many children do you think you will have when you stop having children? (expected family size)2
On the assumption that family size and spacing of children are inversely related, the following question was employed:
3. How many years should there be between children? (preferred spacing between children)
RESULTS
To test if fertility varied by commitment to familism and to individual children as hypothesized, respondents were classified into commitment types. The distribution of each of the four commitment scores was divided at the median to obtain high and low distributions for each case. Each respondent was designated as a particular commitment type by pairing commitment to familism scores with commitment to individual children scores. Because each commitment variable was measured two ways, commitment type could be determined in four ways, resulting from the four combinations of the two pairs of indicators; Familism I-Individual Children I; Familism I-Individual Children II; Familism II-Individual Children I; and
2 In the questionnaire this item was preceded by the question, "How old do you think you will be when you stop having children?"

Familism II-Individual Children II. The mean fertility of respondents within each type was then calculated.
With few exceptions, fertility varied as hypothesized with commitment type. Couples having the lowest fertility (or longest spacing) preferences were those highly committed to individual children and not highly committed to familism. Couples having the highest fertility (or shortest spacing) preferences were those not highly committed to individual children and highly committed to familism. Other couples had intermediate fertility preferences (see Tables 2, 3, 4). In only one instance did the ordering of preferences fail to conform to the hypothesis.
Of the twelve tests of the hypothesis presented in Tables 2, 3, and 4, eleven support it. Thus, a sign test suggests that the null hypothesis can be rejected.
Statistical significance of these results was also assessed with an unweighted means analysis of variance. It will be recalled that fertility preferences were expected to be dependent on both commitment to familism and commitment to individual children. As reported in Tables 2 and 3, the main effects of the commitment variables were generally significant for size preferences. Only two of the sixteen tests failed to yield a value for F that was not significant. As shown in Table 4, however, only two of the eight tests for main effects on spacing preferences were statistically significant. It is to be remembered that a somewhat different classification of cases resulted from the four pairings of the commitment scales. The consistent ordering of means and significant mean differences, at least for size preferences, is therefore remarkable.
The hypothesis also stated that fertility preferences are not completely predicted by either commitment to familism or commitment to individual children alone.

creases fertility. As a consequence, there should not be a significant interactive effect of the two commitment variables given the hypothesized additive nature of their relationship to fertility. As shown in Tables 2, 3, and 4, only two of the twelve interactions were statistically significant.
The validity of the causal model portrayed in Figure 1 was tested using path

analysis and the HoUingshead Two Factor Index of Social Position (195 7). Because there are three measures of fertility, two measures of commitment to familism, and two measures of commitment to individual children, a total of twelve path analyses are reported. A summary of these analyses are presented in Table 5. Path coefficients from social class to familism

tablished, proposing alternative causal models is not recommended. As stated earlier, the overall isomorphism of the data with the model is of more importance than a detailed analysis of the magnitude of the obtained paths. The isomorphism found in this analysis is certainly suggestive enough to warrant further testing and elaboration of the model with other indicators or modifications of the indicators described here.
DISCUSSION
The commitment model of fertility that has been stated and tested in this paper appears to be a potentially useful framework for viewing family-building in modern societies. Commitment to individual children has been shown to be the primary "operator" through which social class is causally linked to fertility (Heise, 197S), although both commitment variables are related to fertility.
The commitment model clearly predicts a negative relationship between class and fertility, a relationship that a number of social scientists might dispute. Hawley (1950, pp. 114-119), for example, has predicted a positive relationship between class and fertility as the demographic transition comes to an end. Wrong (1958) has noted several possible post-transition relationships including U-shaped, reversed J-shaped, and positive. The commitment model predicts an inverse relationship by making the assumption, on the one hand, that opportunities for nonfamilistic life styles are limited for populations of low occupational and educational rank, and on the other hand, that childrearing standards are relatively low for these same populations. Highly ranked populations are subject to just the opposite set of constraints. If childrearing standards, and if opportunities to take up careerist and consumerist life styles are

equal for all populations, then, of course, a pronounced inverse relationship would not be expected.
To the extent that modernization has in fact equalized opportunities and childrearing standards, the commitment model is in no way inconsistent with known data and may account partially for the weak relationship between fertility and class in the above data. But one should not assume that modernization will bring about a full equalization of opportunities for nonfamilistic activity and childrearing standards. The latter may remain quite variable to the former. If it does, there will continue to be a negative relationship between class and fertility, although a weaker one than would be expected if opportunities were not equal.
In any event, commitment to familism and commitment to individual children are related to variables other than class and therefore could produce differential fertility even in a perfectly egalitarian society. The number of variables causally related to fertility, such as religion, race, urbanization, and age, demand a more exhaustive causal interpretation of fertility using the commitment variables than presented here. Of importance in this analysis is the picture derived about the relationship between fertility and social class. The analyses presented here suggest that class is related to fertility through commitment to individual children.
In future analysis, the commitment model should be examined with macrovariables other than class. For example, the variable of race, long important to social demographers, needs to be examined in the context of the model. Goldscheider and Uhlenberg (1969) have suggested that the desire for acculturation by some minority groups is instrumental in lowering fertility, at least if acculturation appears possible at all. The extremely low fertility and high rates of childlessness re-

ported for middle status Black couples may be a function of large quantities of resources invested in adaptation, implying a low commitment to familism. The large quantity of resources demanded by each child, if added to the family, implies a high commitment to individual children for these couples. The data confirmed that it isjust this pattern of commitment that is predictive of lowest fertility.
The commitment model also may be useful for understanding just how family size preferences change as movement through the family life cycle takes place. Thompson and Illsley (1969) and Rainwater (1965) have demonstrated that family size preferences change during the course of married life, most often in a downward direction. Whether these revisions are primarily related to changes in thecommitment to familism or commitment to individual children, or both, could be

made clear through carefully designed longitudinal studies. Such studies could determine how much the commitment variables are dependent on actual family size. Within the limits imposed by macro-variables, commitment to familism and individual children may vary considerably as family life is continually redefined at the addition of each child.
In summary, the concepts of commitment to familism and commitment to individual children may be instrumental in clarifying many anomalous relationships between fertility and other variables which have perplexed demographers for some time.
