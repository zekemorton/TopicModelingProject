ABSTRACT: Data collected in contraceptive prevalence surveys for Korea, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Barbados, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Peru on how soon following childbirth menstruation returned provide the basis for national-level estimates of the duration of postpartum amenorrhea. Two somewhat different techniques are used for estimating median and mean durations of postpartum amenorrhea. The results are compared with information indicating patterns of breastfeeding. The analysis indicates considerable cross-national variation in the mean and median duration of postpartum amenorrhea and suggests that estimating postpartum amenorrhea from information on breastfeeding alone could be misleading.

One of the most significant advances in fertility analysis during the last several decades has been the identification of intermediate (or proximate) fertility determinants and the development of techniques to assess quantitatively their contribution to fertility levels, differentials, and changes. In their pioneering article on the topic, Davis and Blake (1956) specified eleven variables through which, and only through which, all other fertility determinants must operate, be they socioeconomic, cultural, physiological, or environmental. More recently, Bongaarts (1978) revised the original classification and provided a simple analytical accounting framework which permits a quantitative assessment of the contribution of different proximate determinants to given fertility levels or changes.1
1Several other frameworks for relating the proximate determinants to fertility have also been developed. See Gaslonde and Bocaz, 1970; Mosley et al. 1982; and Hobcraft and Little, 1984. To date, however, the Bongaarts framework has received the most attention and application.

Empirically, Bongaarts (1980) found that four proximate determinants-- marriage pattern, contraceptive use and effectiveness, prevalence of induced abortion, and the duration of the postpartum nonsusceptible period (the period prior to the resumption of ovulation following a birth)--account for most variation in fertility levels among populations. The postpartum nonsusceptible period varies considerably, not only among individuals, but between different populations or population subgroups. It is more or less coincident with the period of postpartum amenorrhea and is believed to be primarily determined by the duration and intensity of breastfeeding (Tyson and Perez, 1978).
One hindrance to the application of Bongaarts' accounting scheme has been the lack of information based on representative samples of the duration of the nonsusceptible period for many populations. As a result, applications of the Bongaarts scheme have generally relied on estimating the duration of the nonsusceptible period from information on

the duration of breastfeeding. Given the variability in the relationship between these two, information specifically on the duration of the postpartum nonsusceptible period would be extremely useful and would improve the accuracy with which the contribution of proximate determinants can be assessed. Moreover, the length of the postpartum nonsusceptible period determines how soon after a birth a woman is at risk of conception, and hence in need of contraception if she wishes to delay or prevent the next pregnancy (McCann et a]., 1981). Consequently, reliable information on the duration of the postpartum nonsusceptible period is of considerable importance to family planning programs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
In a number of Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys administered by Westinghouse Health Systems during the last few years in developing countries, information was collected which makes it possible to indirectly estimate the duration of postpartum amenorrhea and hence the period of postpartum nonsusceptibility. While the periods of postpartum amenorrhea and nonsusceptibility are not strictly identical, they tend to be quite similar. Since ovulation generally precedes menstruation by two weeks, the period of nonsusceptibility would end two weeks prior to the resumption of menstruation or to when menstruation would have resumed (in cases where the woman conceives prior to first menstruation for those women whose first menstrual cycle following childbirth is ovulatory). For some women, however, the first one or two menstrual cycles are anovulatory and the period of nonsusceptibility exceeds the period of amenorrhea (McCann et

al., 1981). To some extent, these two groups of women balance each other out, and thus the average durations of postpartum amenorrhea and nonsusceptibility would be quite similar to the aggregate level.
In the present study, we utilized two related techniques to estimate the duration of postpartum amenorrhea. One, referred to as the "monthly current status technique," is used to approximate the cumulative probabilities of postpartum amenorrhea terminating at successive monthly intervals following a birth, as well as to estimate the median duration of postpartum amenorrhea. The other, referred to as the "prevalence technique," is used only to estimate the mean duration of postpartum amenorrhea.
Each of the two techniques requires us to determine, for each woman who has had at least one live birth, whether or not, at the time of interview, she had experienced a termination of postpartum amenorrhea as indicated by either a return of menstruation or a new pregnancy since her last live birth. In the case of the monthly current status approach, a cross-tabulation of a woman's current status with respect to termination of amenorrhea and the number of months since her last live birth are treated as if they represent the experience of a cohort of women over time during successive months following a birth. The median duration of postpartum amenorrhea is estimated as the point at which the experience of this synthetic cohort indicates 50 per cent of the women had terminated postpartum amenorrhea.
The prevalence technique provides an even simpler way for estimating the mean duration of postpartum amenorrhea. The mean is computed simply by dividing the number of women currently

amenorrheic (in the present case, limited to those who had their last live birth within three years of the interview) by the average number of births per month (estimated in the present study by the average number of monthly births in the 12 months prior to interview). Implicit in this technique is the assumption of stability in postpartum amenorrhea duration and the annual flow of births over the recent past.
Both methods have been described elsewhere, although usually in connection with the estimation of the duration of breastfeeding for which the logic is quite similar (Page, 1982; Ferry and Smith, 1983). World Fertility Survey data show the prevalence technique to be surprisingly robust, given its simplicity, through comparisons made between different techniques (Ferry and Smith, 1983). An example of its use for estimating both breastfeeding and postpartum amenorrhea durations is available in a regional study of Brazil (Anderson et al.,1983).
Information from Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys on the number of months since last live birth is available either from a direct question or by comparing the reported month and year of the birth with the date of the interview. The woman's current status in terms of postpartum amenorrhea is determined in one of two ways. In one survey, responses to a question on current pregnancy status are combined with responses as to how long after the last live birth menstruation resumed. In other surveys, responses to a question on current pregnancy status are combined with responses as to how long ago the last menstrual period was experienced. It should be noted that some women who reported themselves as currently pregnant may have conceived prior to a re-

turn of menstruation. For convenience, however, we will refer to this combined proportion of women who either menstruated or became pregnant as the proportion who experienced termination of postpartum amenorrhea. This is done since, for pregnant women, ovulation must have resumed and the nonsusceptible period must have terminated.
Monthly current status data typically display irregularities due to the limited number of respondents who had a birth each particular number of months prior to interview. For application of the monthly current status approach, these irregularities were smoothed by calculating three-month weighted moving averages of the proportions of women classified as having experienced the termination of postpartum amenorrhea. No smoothing was necessary for applications of the prevalence approach.
In practice, determination of whether or not a woman experienced termination of postpartum amenorrhea (in the sense used here) is complicated somewhat by the choice of coded response categories for the question on when menstruation was last experienced and, in some cases, by ambiguities in the response pattern. For all surveys, data on how long ago the respondent had her last menstrual period were recorded in pre-coded categories. These categories, however, were not uniform across surveys. Only in the two Colombian surveys was a category specifically designated for "not since pregnancy." In each of the surveys, the coded categories distinguished between women whose last menstruation occurred within one month, between one and two months, and more than two months prior to interview. In several, a separate category was also included for women whose most recent menstrual period oc-

curred more than nine months prior to interview. Data from the one survey in which women were asked how long it took for menstruation to return after the most recent birth were also pre-coded, including an explicit category for women who had not yet experienced a return of menstruation. Since, in all surveys, pregnancy status at the time of interview was asked, currently pregnant women could be identified and placed into a separate category.
Theoretically, a woman who was still experiencing postpartum amenorrhea at the time of interview should report her last menses as occurring more than nine months ago (the duration of pregnancy plus the month since last birth). Examination of response patterns from the Peru, Sri Lanka, and Thailand surveys, the three surveys which differentiate women reporting their last menstural period occurring between three and nine months ago from those reporting it as occurring more than nine months ago, revealed that a sizable minority of women reported having experienced their last menstruation three to nine months ago but did not report themselves aspregnant. Most women in this category who gave birth only a few months prior to interview were presumably still amenorrheic but, rather than including the nine months of pregnancy in the reported months since last menstruation, they probably reported the number of months without menstruation since giving birth. This interpretation is supported by thefindingthat the number of women who reported their last menstruation as three to nine months ago drops off sharply for those whose last birth was more than nine months ago. In addition, some women in this category have mistakenly interpreted nonmenstrual bleeding shortly after giving birth as a

menstrual period even though no menstruation was subsequently experienced. Thus, for the initial year after giving birth, women who reported their last menstrual period within 60 days of interview or reported themselves as pregnant are considered to have experienced termination of postpartum amenorrhea. The exceptions are two Colombian surveys in which a special category of "not since pregnancy" was included and the 1981 Costa Rican survey in which a question was asked on how long after the last live birth menstruation resumed. Women in all other categories, unless pregnant, were considered to still be in the postpartum amenorrheic stage with a few exceptions due to unusual features of the codes chosen in particular countries.2
RESULTS
Results based on the monthly current status technique for all countries to date for which the requisite data were collected are presented in Table 1 for monthly intervals through the first year following the most recent birth.3 Al-
2Additional details of the rules followed in the determination of a woman's current status with respect to termination of postpartum amenorrhea specific to the particular surveys are provided in an earlier version of this study issued as Research Report No. 83-42, Population Studies Center, University of Michigan, November, 1983.
3In all but the 1981 Thailand survey, the number of months since last birth was either asked directly or was calculated by subtracting the reported month and year of last birth from the month and year of interview. In the former case, respondents are assumed to have given responses to the nearest completed number of months rather than strictly the last completed month and thus to be centered on the first day rather than the middle of each month. Similarly, subtraction of the month and year of last birth from the month and year of interview yields single month categories centered on the first day of the month corresponding to the difference between the two dates (Page et al., 1982).

though the technique does not ensure that the proportions terminating postpartum amenorrhea will decline at each successive month since the most recent birth (as would be the case if a true cohort were being followed, or if standard life table methodology were applied), this turns out to be the case, with only occasional exceptions. Moreover, for all surveys, a median duration of postpartum amenorrhea (defined as the point at which 50 percent indicated either a return of menses or a pregnancy) can be unambiguously identified.
The total number of women included in the calculations are also presented. Since the results represent three-month moving averages, the number of women serving as the basis of of the proportion terminating at any specific monthly interval is, of course, substantially less than the total number of women (averaging 3/13 of the total).4 The number of women serving as the basis of the calculation of the median is also given. For all but the 1978 survey in Costa Rica, interpolation between the threemonth moving averages for two successive monthly intervals was necessary; thus, the number of women involved in the calculation of the median came from those who reported their most recent
Results from the 1981 Thailand survey, where months since last birth had to be calculated by subtracting the month and year of last birth from the date of the midpoint of the survey fieldwork, have been adjusted for presentation in the present study so that they are directly comparable to results from the other surveys. For this reason, the results presented in Table 1 for the 1981 Thailand survey differ from those published previously (see Knodel et al., 1982).
4Since three-month weighted moving averages are used as the basis for each monthly figure, to obtain figures through the twelfth month, data for the first thirteen months must be used. The total number of women thus cover a thirteen-month period, and the average number used for any single-month calculation is 3/13ths of the total.

birth as occurring during some specific four-month period prior to the survey. For 1978 in Costa Rica, the median fell exactly on the midpoint of a monthly interval and thus involves women whose last birth occurred over a three-month period. It is evident that the medians are not based on large numbers of women. The fact that the overall results for each country closely approximate a monotonic increase in the proportions estimated as terminating postpartum amenorrhea, and that a unique median is evident in all cases, provides grounds for some confidence in the results. However, the median for Barbados and for the 1978 Costa Rican survey, both of which are based on substantially fewer women than is the case for the other surveys, should be treated with particular caution.
What is most striking about the results is how quickly postpartum amenorrhea appears to terminate in most of the countries. Only for Korean women is the median duration substantially above half a year. The estimated median durations of only one month for Costa Rica in 1978 and 1.6 months for Barbados both seem extraordinarily low and may well be less reliable due to the small number of cases on which they are based. It is noteworthy that the 1981 survey in Costa Rica, which is based on a much larger number of cases as well as a somewhat different question for determining the woman's current status, yields a longer and more plausible estimate of postpartum amenorrhea. While the estimate of 1.6 months in Barbados seems quite low, it is somewhat reassuring that results for subsequent month intervals also are consistent with a low duration of postpartum amenorrhea. In brief, the results suggest that at least for most of the limited number of develop-

ing countries for which Westinghouse Contraceptive Prevalence Survey data are available, postpartum nonsusceptibility is providing protection against a new pregnancy for only a relatively brief period following a birth for the majority of women.
Although the median is calculated as the duration at which 50 per cent of the synthetic cohort of women who recently gave birth either experience a return of menstruation or a pregnancy, it should be recognized that, for a small proportion of any real cohort of women giving birth at any particular time, postpartum amenorrhea will merge into menopause; for these women, there will be neither a return of menstruation nor a subsequent pregnancy. The proportion will depend on the duration of proportions amenorrheic, and the average age at birth is positively related to each. Under virtually any realistic circumstances, however, the proportion should be small since the average age at menopause is typically far higher than average age at last birth, even in natural fertility populations (Gray, 1979). The fact that postpartum amenorrhea rarely merges into menopause is confirmed in Table 2 which shows the proportion of women who reported neither a pregnancy nor a return of menstruation among those whose most recent birth occurred 19-24 months and 32-36 months prior to interview. As the results indicate (with the exception only of Honduras), this involved less than 10 percent of women in the latter category. Some of these women will probably still experience a return of menstruation and thus the percentage shown is an estimate of the maximum extent to which this complication occurs.
Estimates of the mean duration of postpartum amenorrhea obtained by

the prevalence technique are presented in Table 3 at the national level as well as separately for the urban and rural segments of the population. Given that medians derived from the monthly current status techniques are based on a far smaller number of cases than are means from the prevalence technique, only the latter are employed for obtaining separate urban and rural estimates. As with the calculation of the median, the means based on the prevalence technique also ignore the problem created by the fact that, in reality, the period of postpartum amenorrhea for some women would merge into menopause. This should not seriously distort our estimates, however, given the small proportion of women involved. Moreover, the fact that the prevalence technique is applied only to women who had a birth in the last three years further minimizes any problem created by menopausal women reporting themselves as still amenorrheic. Indeed, since a small number of women also might experience postpartum amenorrhea for more than three years, the exclusion of women whose birth occurred more than three years ago will act to cancel out the effect of amenorrhea merging into menopause for other women.
The rank ordering of the mean duration of postpartum amenorrhea (from the prevalence technique) on the national level is almost identical to that based on the median calculated from the monthly current status technique. For both the mean and the median, Korea is characterized by the longest average duration, and Costa Rica, in 1978, by the shortest. In every case except for Korea, the estimated mean is longer than the estimated median. A longer mean than median is generally to be expected for populations in which the median dura-

tion of amenorrhea is short as is apparently the case in most of the countries included in the present study (see Lesthaeghe, 1982; Figure 2). While there is undoubtedly a margin of error involved in estimates from either technique, it is encouraging that for Barbados and for Costa Rica in 1978--the two surveys which yielded median durations that appeared to be implausibly low-- the means yielded by the prevalence technique fall within a more plausible range. Even if these measures are not

precise, they do clearly point to short postpartum amenorrhea in both populations. Thus, even if the estimates are not exact, they enable us to gain a fairly good sense of the orders of magnitude involved.
Given the virtually universal finding for developing countries that breastfeeding is less common and of shorter duration among urban women compared to rural women (McCann et al., 1981; Kent, 1981; Ferry and Smith, 1981), we would expect parallel urban-

rural differences in postpartum amenorrhea to be evident. It is thus encouraging that the results indicate shorter average periods of postpartum amenorrhea among urban women in comparison to their rural counterparts for all of the surveys. The differences range from as much asfivemonths or more in Honduras and Peru to under two months for Colombia and Costa Rica. Thus, there is some variation in the differences between rural and urban populations with respect to the amount of protection provided against pregnancy through postpartum amenorrhea.
It is of considerable interest to compare our estimates of the duration of

postpartum amenorrhea with information on breastfeeding patterns. Of the surveys which serve as the basis for our estimates of postpartum amenorrhea, most did not include questions on infant feeding practices; of those that did, only results from the 1981 Thailand survey have been analyzed in detail. Fortunately, however, for countries covered in the present study (except for Barbados and Honduras), data on breastfeeding patterns are available from the World Fertility Survey for years not far removed from the time of the Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys. In addition, unpublished tabulations on current status data regarding breastfeeding are available for Barbados from the Contraceptive Prevalence Survey, and they can be used to provide at least some relevant information. Thus, only for Honduras is no information available.
Analysis of breastfeeding patterns from survey data is a complex matter involving a number of methodological problems (Page et al., 1982). There is no single measure that most accurately indicates the extent of breastfeeding in a population; thus, whenever possible, several indices based on different approaches are presented in Table 4. In all the countries with available data except Costa Rica, breastfeeding is close to universal, involving at least 90 per cent of all children; in Costa Rica, only about three-quarters of children are ever breastfed. The average duration of breastfeeding is noticeably longer in the three Asian countries than in the Latin American ones. This is evident from the two alternative measures of the median duration, as well as from the estimated proportions of children still breastfeeding at six and twelve months of age. Particularly striking is the very low median duration of breastfeeding in Costa Rica

(less than two months according to one estimate). Less than one in three children in Costa Rica is breastfed for at least six months, and less than one in ten for at least a year. In contrast, over 90 per cent of Korean children are reported as breastfed for at least six months.
The extremely short duration of breastfeeding in Costa Rica, as well as the relatively high proportion of mothers who never initiate breastfeeding, is consistent with the short durations of postpartum amenorrhea indicated in the Costa Rican Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys (although not necessarily as low as the one-month estimate of the median for 1978). Likewise, the short duration of breastfeeding indicated in Barbados is more or less consistent with the short duration of postpartum amenorrhea indicated there. At the other end of

the scale, Korea, Sri Lanka, and Thailand are all characterized by durations of breastfeeding of close to a year and a half or more. Despite these apparently similar breastfeeding patterns, the Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys have indicated considerably longer postpartum amenorrhea in Korea than in either Sri Lanka or Thailand. In the middle of the scale, Colombia is characterized both by a shorter median duration of postpartum amenorrhea and shorter breastfeeding than is Peru.
The lack of close correspondence between the estimates of postpartum amenorrhea and breastfeeding patterns evident in the comparison of Korea with Sri Lanka and Thailand may, of course, be due to errors in measurement of either or both phenomena. On the other hand, it may also reflect a lack of com-

plete information on breastfeeding as well as the influence of other relevant but unmeasured variables. While precise knowledge of the determinants of the relationship between breastfeeding and postpartum amenorrhea is still lacking, there is considerable evidence that one important influence is the type of feeding regime followed. In particular, the impact of breastfeeding on prolonging postpartum amenorrhea is greater for mothers who exclusively breastfeed than for those who follow a mixed feeding pattern (Van Ginneken, 1974). Unfortunately, data permitting the distinction between full and partial breastfeeding were collected in only a small number of the countries participating in the World Fertility Survey, not including any of those under consideration. It seems likely that responses to a general question not specifically distinguishing partial from full breastfeeding refer to any form of breastfeeding (Page, etal., 1982).
In the 1981 Thailand Contraceptive Prevalence Survey, however, information was collected on the age at which nonmilk food was introduced into the child's diet and thus permits the calculation of the duration of "full" breastfeeding.5 Analysis of these data indicated that supplemental food was commonly introduced at a very early age and thus the median duration of full breastfeeding was only 2.1 months, in sharp contrast to the much longer duration of breastfeeding. This could account for the relatively short period of postpar-

turn amenorrhea indicated for Thailand, despite the short duration of any breastfeeding. Moreover, in comparison with those few countries for which the World Fertility Survey did collect information specifically on partial and full breastfeeding, Thai women appear to introduce supplemental food unusually early (see Santow and Singh, 1984, and Singh and Ferry, 1984). Whether similar differences between the extent of full and partial breastfeeding are behind the lack of a closer correspondence between the two estimates for the other countries is impossible to determine without more complete information on infant feeding practices than was collected in the World Fertility Survey for these countries. This must remain an unanswered question for the time being.
To some extent, the urban-rural differences in postpartum amenorrhea as estimated from the Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys conform with differences in the duration of breastfeeding indicated by the World Fertility Survey. World Fertility Survey results are available for all the same countries for which we provide urban-rural estimates of postpartum amenorrhea except Honduras. These results indicate longer breastfeeding on the average in rural than in urban areas in all such countries (Ferry and Smith, 1983). Based on mean current status estimates for all births, the rural-urban difference in breastfeeding duration was only two months for Costa Rica and only three months for Colombia, while in both Peru and Korea, a difference of six months is indicated. World Fertility Survey estimates of rural-urban difference in breastfeeding duration are also available for Sri Lanka and Thailand where the indicated differences are five and eleven months, respectively. The fact that a much larger
