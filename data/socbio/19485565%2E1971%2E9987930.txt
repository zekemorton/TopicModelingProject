For several decades, social scientists and demographers interested in population processes have focused research efforts on the formation of attitudes toward childbearing. Many variables, including race, religious preference, social class, and social mobility have been found to be instrumental in the formation of these attitudes and in the subsequent fertility experienced by the couples. However, little data can be found on -what factors predispose a couple to negative fertility attitudes, that is, to desire to have no children.
The lack of attention given to the voluntarily childless couple, and indeed to the childless couple in general, probably stems from several factors. Firstly, the phenomenon of childlessness, whether voluntary or involuntary, is increasingly rare. Table 1 shows the percent of evermarried women who were childless at selected ages and dates from 1940 to 1967. The total age group, as well as selected age categories within the total group, have experienced steady declines in childlessness. But to assume that this trend will continue

may be an error. With increasingly effective means of contraception available, with abortion laws undergoing examination and change, and with increasing concern with, and publicity over, growing population, this trend may very well reverse itself.
Secondly, the neglect of the voluntarily childless couple may be a result of the tendency to view childlessness as just another quantitative state of parity. It would seem that there are important qualitative differences associated with childless and childed states, since those who are presently childless are in violation of the statistical and social norm to have children.
Finally, were the above problems to be ignored or deemed not prohibitive, the design of a systematic study of voluntarily childless couples is a formidable task. Where would such couples be found? How could the researcher be sure that the childlessness was voluntary?
MATERIALS AND METHODS
In an attempt to bridge this research hiatus and to begin to cope with the difficult problems of sampling, this paper deals with the seventy-two childless

couples who during the last two years applied to the Association for Voluntary Sterilization (AVS) for help in obtaining surgical sterilizations. Such couples, of course, are not representative of the total population of voluntary childless couples in the country. It might be maintained that these couples are more dedicated to the idea of remaining childless than other couples might be, since they are willing to take this frequently irreversible step.
Undoubtedly there are couples who have had such operations for the purpose of preventing conception without theaid of AVS. But the couples who come to AVS are sometimes from communities where it is difficult to obtain such operations. Asone applicant stated rather bitterly: "I have tried to obtain a vasectomy locally but Puritanism is still strong in this part of the country and no consideration whatsoever is given to private individual judgments and wishes." If this is often the case, these couples may be the most flagrant norm violators ofall.
They are described here, then, not as a representative or probability sample of all voluntarily childless couples. Instead they constitute an availability sample. In fact, they might best be treated as a separate population since there is little basis for estimating the degree to which even gross demographic characteristics of the national

population of voluntarily childless couples are represented by these seventy-two couples. Nevertheless, it is hoped that detailed description of their characteristics will provide theoretical and research leads for further investigations of negative fertility attitudes.
DATA AND RESULTS
Table 2 gives preliminary descriptive data on the applicants to AVS. The vast majority of these applicants are males, presumably since a vasectomy is a simpler operation than a tubal ligation would be. Most of them come from the northeastern region of the United States. Table 2 also shows that most of these couples come from large urban areas. Indeed, while 12<fi> of them seem to come from very small communities this is probably an overstatement of thenumbers actually from isolated small communities since some of the small places included in that category are in fact suburbs of very large metropolitan areas.
The mean number of years these couples have been married is 5.2,but half of them have been married for less than four years and two-thirds have been married for less than six years before applying to AVS for assistance. Finally, most of the couples heard about AVS through some form of mass media, including radio or TV, maga-

zines, and newspapers. While most of the applicants for the actual operations were males, the magazines most frequently mentioned as sources of information about AVS, were McCalls, Redbook, and other magazines traditionally thought of as women's publications.
Table 3 shows the age, religion, and socioeconomic status of both husbands and wives, as measured by their occupation, education, and income. Also shown are comparable data for the United States population at selected dates. This enables

some comparison of these voluntarily childless couples with the general population on at least four of these characteristics.
The mean age of husbands in this sample is 32 and of wives 29--the traditional three-year difference in age found in most populations. Over 50% of both husbands and wives are less than 30. The decision to be sterilized in order to prevent conception is apparently an early one. However, 17% of the husbands and 10% of the wives are over 40, so that this decision is not exclusively confined to extremely young couples by any means.
Perhaps the most theoretically interesting finding concerning the characteristics of these couples is the disproportionate number among them who have no religion whatever. Forty per cent of the husbands and 36% of the wives fall into this category, as opposed to 4% and 1% of U.S. males and females respectively. Catholics are under-represented among these couples in comparison with their proportion in the population, as might be expected given the prohibition against birth control and the value placed on children in this religion. But other religious groups are also under-represented among the childless couples, with two exceptions. Jewish men, who comprise 11% of the childless husbands, constitute only 4 % of the general population. Secondly, both sexes in the "Other Protestant" category are somewhat over-represented among the 72 couples when compared to national proportions.
By any of the three measures of socioeconomic status shown in Table 3 these childless couples are clearly of higher status than the United States population in general. The occupational score used here is a measure computed by using standardized scores of income and education associated with each occupation in the United States. If we compare the husbands

of the childless couples to the heads of U.S. families in 1960 (a not entirely comparable group) it can be seen that the childless husbands are much more likely to be in the highest status occupations (62%) than are the U.S. family heads (14%). Even the childless wives have higher occupations overall than do U.S. family heads.
The educational attainment comparison is even more striking. Fully 62% of the childless husbands have a college degree or more, while only 10% of the male U.S. population could claim such an educational attainment in 1960. It is only fair to point out, however, that since the childless couples are largely below 30, their educational attainment is likely to be higher than that for the entire U.S. population. Table 3 also gives the educational attainment distribution for males and females age 2S-34 years in the United States in 1960. Still, the voluntarily childless couples show a much higher educational attainment.
The distribution of income follows this same pattern. The mean income of the childless husbands is $8,860 while that same figure for U.S. males in 1967 was $6,159. Similarly with females there is nearly a $2,000 differential in the income of these childless wives and U.S. females in 1967.
Table 4 gives the contraceptive and pregnancy histories of these couples. The great majority of them (89%) were contracepting at the time they requested sterilization and had been doing so for a number of years. Eight per cent had used some form of contraception previously but were not now doing so. Three per cent of them had never contracepted.
Since most of the couples mentioned using various methods of contraception, the percentages in this column do not add to 100 and multiple responses are included.

* The percentages here do not add to 100 since several couples mentioned using several different methods.

Oral contraceptives were by far the most frequent method of contraception used. Condoms and diaphragms were less frequently used by these couples, and other methods shown in Table 4 were not often mentioned.
The mean number of years these couples had been contracepting, by whatever method, is 4.3. The largest group of them had contracepted for five or more years, with one couple reporting they had been practicing birth control for 18 years. Apparently the decision to be sterilized is not often a quick one made in reaction to the inconvenience of contracepting. A disappointingly large percentage of these couples did not report these data, most probably due to the actual wording of the question, which asked them to specify

282

when they began using contraceptives. It could be that they could not remember or that they did not feel these data were relevant to AVS.
Finally, Table 4 gives the pregnancy history of these couples. Apparently 7 1 % of them have never been pregnant, since they are presently childless and have had neither miscarriages nor abortions. Another option exists--to bear a child and then give it up by adoption--and these data would not show how many couples have done so. Six per cent of the couples have had abortions, and 9% have had miscarriages, which may or may not have been deliberately inflicted.

be sterilized. Unfortunately, 24% of the applicants said simply that they did not wish to have any children--making them unusable for an analysis which tries to tap reasons for not wanting children. Table 5 gives both the first reason given by the couples in making their application and

the total reasons mentioned by the couples. The most common reason given by these couples was some concern for the world or national population problem. The theoretical question this finding raises is whether this is a true reason which motivates these couples or whether this is a socially acceptable reason they have seized upon with the advent of population propaganda in order to justify a decision they have already made. These data do not provide answers to questions of this sort.
Health reasons were also important in leading to this decision to seek sterilization. Included here were heart conditions, blood problems, or other physical conditions, particularly of the wives, which would make childbearing difficult at best. These are presumably conditions out of the direct control of these couples and might not qualify them as strictly voluntarily childless.
Several of the couples mentioned deep or time-consuming involvement with careers which would make child rearing inconvenient. Typical of this kind of comment, made by 17% of the sample, is the following:
Before my wife and I were married seven years ago, we both expressed our desires to have no children, so that we could do justice to our work, unhindered. I am a writer. My wife is deeply involved in sculpturing. We both have jobs and come home at night to our hobbies.
Eleven per cent of the sample simply stated that they were too old to begin their families now. In some cases these couples married late, but in others no reason is given for not starting the family at an earlier age.
A plain dislike for children was given as a reason for wanting to remain childless by 12% of the sample. Typical of this kind of response are the following:
Both of us are too familiar with the smell of sour pablum, diaper pails, and baby

"b.m.'s" and we find equally nauseating the sound of crying, screaming, and infant temper tantrums. These so called "joys of parenthood" are definitely not for us.
Or the couple who said:
We are unable to tolerate the presence of children for any appreciable length of time and cannot imagine any circumstances in which either of us would ever want children of our own.
Some of the couples mentioned economic problems which they felt prohibited them from having children. Examples of these couples' comments include:
We are unable to afford the expenses of pregnancy, child birth, child raising and subsequent family illnesses . . . . An accidental pregnancy now would keep us living in cheap apartments for the rest of our lives.
One of the wives wrote:
Another reason we do not want children are our financial problems. My husband never finished school, and his low paying job doesn't really meet our needs, with the high cost of living. It pays the bills and there is none left over for saving. There is no real future in his job. . . . We live in a one bedroom 8' by 31' housetrailer and it's really too crowded for the two of us. It will be several years, if ever, before we can hope to do better. A new car must come first, as our 14 year old Chevrolet won't stand up much longer without falling apart.
Other reasons given by fairly small proportions of the sample include some mention of a preferred style of life, other than professional ambitions, which would be inhibited by children. Included here are couples who intend to travel or who enjoy solitude for its own sake. World conditions, other than overpopulation, were mentioned by 7f0 of this group. These respondents were concerned about war, pollution, crime, etc., and did not feel such a world was a good place to bring up children. Finally, nine of the couples intend to adopt children, which, of course,

does not make them voluntarily childless at all.
Included in the category labeled "Other" reasons were a smattering of couples who were mentally retarded, who thought such an operation would improve their sexual life, or who said only that they -were frankly untrusting of the birth-control methods available to them, for health or effectiveness reasons.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
This has indeed been a cursory look at a select population of couples who, with the exception of nine potential adopters, intend to be permanently childless. With such limited data and given such a population, the most we can hope to do is pick up a few leads as to what sorts of characteristics persons with negative fertility attitudes are likely to have and what they perceive as some of the reasons behind this attitude. Our data show that an average couple in this group is likely to be living in a large metropolitan area and to have been married an average of about five years. They are likely to be about thirty years of age, to say they have no religion, and to be of generally high sodoeconomic status. Most all of them have used some method of birth control, usually the pill, have been contracepting for a number of years, and are not likely to have had a miscarriage or abortion. Such a profile of the average person in our sample, of course, obscures as much as it enlightens.
Finally, in looking at the reasons for wanting to remain childless, population concerns and health considerations are the two most mentioned reasons and if truly a reflection of the couple's rationale are not "selfish" reasons which may be ascribed to childless couples by society in general. Reasons which might be more reasonably associated with hedonism include career commitments, style of life, or economic

desires. Disliking children and fear of pregnancy might be classified as "hang-ups" which may or may not be associated with selfish pursuits.
In future research on the voluntarily childless couple, the strategy that might be taken in locating these couples is not clearly indicated by these data. It is clear from the small percentage of the population which they comprise that random samples of the population, unless quite large, are not likely to unearth sufficient numbers of them to do detailed tabulations. An availability sampling technique might be tried in large communities--with no hope of representativeness. These authors tried, prior to receiving these data from AVS, to search out such couples in several ways, including surveying couples in apartments known to be one-bedroom or smaller where the presence of children was unlikely. This method of course turns up mostly couples who are postponing their childbearing, a few single people, and several pregnant wives. Further, even

among the couples found who claim to be permanently and voluntarily childless, some of them will no doubt experience an accidental pregnancy in the future and keep the child. It is possible to place ads in various newspapers and other community publication asking childless couples to volunteer to answer a questionnaire. Such a method is plagued by the usual problems associated with using volunteers in any research.
Nevertheless, these two methods in concert, used over a period of time in a large community, might yield another select population like the one discussed here. Certainly any additional data would be useful, since as mentioned above, the literature on these special couples with negative fertility attitudes is so sparse.
