ABSTRACT: We present data on fertility characteristics in the Venezuelan population for each sex separately, allowing a detailed comparative analysis of the variance in fertility between males and females. We show that the fertility distribution for both sexes is discontinuous, that the average female has a larger number of offspring per individual than the average male, and that highly fertile males outnumber highly fertile females so that the total number of offspring produced by males and females is balanced. Results indicate that a few males are responsible for a relative higher fertility of the average female and that interactions between polyandric females with monogamic and polygynic males are common. Among the Yanomami, a relatively unacculturated hunter-gatherer-horticulturist tribe, similar differences in fertility distribution of both sexes are apparent. The data suggest that human populations contain statistically distinct subpopulations, with different reproductive strategies, suggesting the existence of complex interactions among human populations which are not evident from the study of individuals or groups.

Recent studies have shown that many species traditionally thought of as monogamous in their pairing habits are polygamous in their reproductive habits, making it necessary to restudy the mating systems and reproductive strategies of most species (CluttonBrock, 1989). In addition, the sex ratio of most species, even in polygamous ones, is close to one (Fisher, 1930). As fecundity differs markedly between the sexes, optimal reproduction (maximizing direct and inclusive fitness in the long term) varies between sexes, and each sex has to use a different reproductive strategy. A result of such strategies can be seen in the presence of size dimorphism between the sexes, i.e., species with polygynous males produce males which are larger than their females (Wilson, 1976).

It is generally assumed that Homo sapiens is essentially polygynous, where the variance in reproductive success is greater among men than among women (Daly and Wilson, 1983; Chagnon, 1980). The polygynous behavior accordingly explains a slight sex dimorphism in human body size (Wilson, 1976; Alexander et al., 1979; Daly and Wilson, 1983; Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1984). Polygyny is caused by differences in the amount of parental investment given by each sex for the survival of their offspring. Females invest more in metabolic costs and in time dedicated to child rearing and thus can bear and rear a limited number of offspring (Trivers, 1972; Trivers and Willard, 1973; Maynard-Smith, 1976). Extreme polygyny in humans is limited by female behavior. Hidden estrus, contin-

uous sexual receptivity, and synchronization of menstrual cycles, and other factors, make it difficult for males to control large harems (Daniels, 1979; Burley, 1979). These facts suggest that the optimal reproductive strategy for each sex should be different among humans (Daly and Wilson, 1983; Grammer, 1989; Buss, 1989).
The existence of different combinations of optimal reproductive strategies implies that fertility will be distributed differently among individuals of each sex in a given population. Unfortunately, fertility data for human populations, obtained through population census, is available only for females, and the few published data available on male fertility (for example, Howell, 1979; Chagnon, 1980; Daly and Wilson, 1983; Brown, 1988; Hewlett, 1988) stem from studies conducted on population isolates and minorities which do not permit the plotting of detailed, statistically meaningful, fertility distribution curves. However, all these studies showed a greater variance for male fertility compared to that for females, although detailed analysis of the source of this greater variability is missing. On the other hand, data on female fertility distributions from Bangladesh (Bongaarts and Potter, 1983) and from U.S. censuses (David and Sanderson, 1987) showed clear discontinuous distributions of fertility characteristics between the populations, indicating complex reproductive patterns in human populations.
We had the opportunity to participate in a survey based on large regional populations and to obtain data on fertility for both males and females, thanks to the inclusion of questions on fertility in the political polls for the

Venezuelan presidential elections of 1988. We studied the Venezuelan voting population (aged 18 years and over) and estimated direct individual fitness, using the total number of offspring (TO) ever born for each individual and the number of living offspring (LO) at the moment of the data collection. We also studied fertility among the Yanomami, a relatively unacculturated tribe which inhabit the upper Orinoco River in Venezuela. Yanomami are swidden horticulturists who supplement their diet with hunting and gathering (Lizot, 1988). These data allowed a comparative analysis of the variance in fertility, between males and females.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data from all Yanomami present in the community were collected through informants and direct conversation by anthropologist Gabriele Herzog in 1988 at Seroana, Tayariteri, Mahehototeri, Nahetipe, and Tortitha, all of which are located in the Territorio Federal Amazonas. Only information about living children could be obtained as Yanomami will not speak about their dead. Age of subjects was not possible to obtain as Yanomami do not keep track of their age in number of years. In addition, it was not possible for us to estimate the end of the reproductive life of subjects. Thus, all subjects who were recognized by Yanomami as "marriageable" were included. Results of the 227 individuals represent the total population at that time in the five communities sampled, which in turn have cultural characteristics unique to these communities and different from those of other Yano-

mami. Thus, statistical analysis of these data is meaningless.
Data from 6,500 subjects over 17 years of age (including 1,098 females over 40 and 985 males over 45 years), in 15 urban areas, as representative of the total voting population of Venezuela, were collected through the stratified (by geographical area, economic status, age, and sex, based on the 1981 national census) polls prepared by Simeven, measuring voting intentions for Carlos Andres Perez and by Mevenca for other clients, as part of the presidential campaign of 1988 in Venezuela. (The representativeness of the sample was shown a posteriorito be accurate, with Simeven predicting the main results with an accuracy of 99 per cent). The following questions were given to the subjects (female or male) to answer confidentially and individually: 1. How many living children (legitimate or not) do you have? 2. How many children did you bear during your life? 3. Age of children? 4. Sex and age of informant? All interviews were conducted confidentially, in Spanish, by trained local staff.
Although data collection through questionnaires could seem to be a dubious method for estimating male fertility, this study shows that data provided by males is as reliable as that provided by females, which is the standard procedure for collecting fertility data in human populations, since both samples reported statistically the same total number of children (see results).
Few reliable methods for statistical analysis of mixed samples exist, and among those, the most simple and reliable method available is the Bhattacharya plot (Everitt and Hand, 1981; Bhattacharya, 1967), which detects

discontinuities on a normal frequency distribution through changes in the slope of the distribution curve. Thus, we chose this method to analyze our data.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The fertility distribution among the total adult population sampled, for the Yanomami as well as for the rest of the population studied, showed a different distribution of fertility characteristics for males and females. In Figure 1 we present a snapshot of the total adult population. Here, the number of adult individuals is plotted according to the number of living children they reported (LO). In both samples we find more childless males compared to females, but females outnumbered males in the low fertility categories. Males having very many offspring outnumbered females.
This common pattern among totally different cultures seems neither to be an artifact of the sampling procedure nor a particular characteristic of the samples, as similar sex-differentiated fertility distributions were found for cultures which differ in many other aspects. Among the adult Yanomami, males outnumbered females by a ratio of 1.25. Within a sample of 13 Yanomami villages, Chagnon et al. (1979) found a similar average sexratio of 1.29. In contrast, among the polled population, females outnumbered males by a ratio of 1.05. Also, higher child mortality among Yanomami, a general feature of societies lacking modern medical facilities (Campbell and Wood, 1990) explains their comparatively lower fertility, as measured by LO. In spite of these

dissimilarities, common patterns in the sex-linked fertility distribution between both samples (i.e., both cultures) are evident.
Differential fitness for males and females could be estimated by eliminating subjects from the analysis who had not completed their reproductive life span (only for the polled population). By comparing the age of the last child with that of the informant, we calculated the probability of bearing a child for subjects over 40 years, which was 0.27 for males and 0.07 for females. Subjects aged over 45 years had a probability of child bearing of 0.08 for males and 0.02 for females, and for subjects over 50 years of age the prob-

ability was 0 for females and 0.07 for males. According to these data, we defined the end of the reproductive life span at 45 years for males and 40 years for females. We could thus estimate TO and LO for any individual during his or her reproductive life span with an error smaller than 8 per cent. Although an analysis of age cohorts was not possible with the data (and thus the contribution of individuals who died earlier, was not taken into account here), the frequency distributions from individuals above 35 or 55 years showed qualitatively the same results as reported here (not shown). Thus, the distribution presented is a reliable representation of a specific character of

a given population (i.e., distribution of the maximal probable individual fitness among the population of individuals) and thus serves to analyze fertility differences among sexes.
A plot of fertility distributions using these data (Fig. 2), showed a clear sexdifferentiated discontinuous distribution, confirming the findings given above. Here, the sex difference for childless individuals was greatly reduced, indicating that males delay the initiation of their reproductive life longer than do females. Again, a greater number of females had a higher number of offspring than males, and only among individuals with more than 12 children, did males outnumber fe-

males. Integrating the total output of offspring (LO) for each sex rendered comparable numbers. That is, in our sample, all the females produced a total of 4,661 offspring, whereas all the males together reported 4,690 children (a difference smaller than 0.62 per cent). These results can only be explained if we assume that a relatively small number of males (those with more than 12 children) were responsible for the differential offspring production between the average female and the average male. The equivalence in the total number of offspring produced by each sex is even more striking, if we remember that more females than males were present in the sample

TO and LO, and at the same time it shows the percentage of children dying at each fertility category. Clearly, the effect on the fertility distribution of child mortality is different for men and women. Child mortality affects the fertility distribution of the female population much more than that of males (Fig. 4). Women with more children report more dead offspring than less fertile women. That is, the frequency distribution curve of LO for females is closer to a Poisson distribution than that of TO, partly due to the fact that the death rate among children increased linearly with fertility. Females seem to register TO more accurately than do males, which could explain the significantly (p < 0.001, Students Mest) higher child mortality declared by females, more than twice that given by males. This sex difference in the reporting of deaths validates the use of LO instead of TO for inter-sex comparisons of fertility.
An important factor that might bias our results could be the fact that males do not know or do not recognize all their children, i.e., they may report a lower number of offspring. If so, our results should show a smaller number of total children produced by males than that produced by females. To the contrary, our sample showed that males reported on the average a slightly higher number of children than females. The mean number of children per female was 5.10, whereas that of males was 5.41 children per individual. This figure may be a close approximation of reality, as surviving males have to compensate somehow for the comparatively greater mortality rate of their sex. However, it may also reflect the fact that males tend to overesti-

mate their numbers of offspring. Independent evidence suggests that males often recognize as their own (consciously or not) children who have a different biological father (Wiener, 1943; Schacht and Gershowitz, 1963). Contrary to this expectation, our results showed that the female fertility distribution peaked at a higher fertility category than that of males (Figs. 2 and 3), strongly suggesting that the average female in the low-fertility categories (fewer than 12 children) has more mates (in time or space) than the average male, whereas the inverse occurs in the high fertility categories (more than 12 children).
Although fertility data do not characterize reproductive strategies directly, here they serve to estimate the relative importance of the various reproductive strategies and to describe the sex-dependent variance in reproductive success. The data are consistent with a population consisting of a large proportion of polyandrous females (possibly sequentially and not simultaneously in time) and an average monogamic male with some highly polygynous males. The polygamous reproductive systems found here do not necessarily correlate with polygamous marriage systems, although this could be checked, for example, by correlating data on fertility with information on divorce.
Mixed population samples. -- None of the fertility distributions presented could be adjusted to a Poisson distribution (nor any normal distribution: p « 0.001; SPSS's goodness of fit tests). Thus, an important point which emerges from this study is that average values do not accurately reflect the structure of populations. There is more

than one modal point within a population. For a finer analysis of human societies, populations should be studied as being made up of individuals who use different noncompatible, but finite, strategies. Thus, techniques for mixed samples analysis (Bhattacharya, 1967; Everitt and Hand, 1981) are useful for human population studies.
In one such approach, two statistically recognizable subpopulations in the United States have been defined as "birth controllers" and "noncontrollers" (David and Sanderson, 1987). In our study, we recognize at least three subpopulations: infertile, weakly fertile, and highly fertile individuals, respectively, although a Bhattacharya plot, rebounding the modes of the curve (by plotting the derivative of the curve, i.e., the slope at each point of the curve), shows the presence of an even more complex pattern (Fig. 5). Here we see that females constitute four statistically distinct subpopulations which on average have 3.8, 6,7.5, or 12 living children, whereas males constitute at least four distinct subpopulations which on average have 2.5, 4.5, 8.5, or over 12 living children (Table 1). That is, the fertility of female subpopulations does not match that of males, although the total production of children is balanced. For the two subpopulations with low fertility, females have more children than males, but for the subpopulations with high fertility, males have more children than females. Thus, none of the subpopulations are mainly monogamous. For low fertility, polyandry seems to prevail; at high fertility, polygamous males are more common.
More individuals were found in the two low-fertility categories (see Fig. 2),

indicating that most females are more fertile than males and a few males compensate for this fertility differential. Although no appropriate data on male fertility are available for other populations, data exist on female fertility. Fertility data from Bangladesh females (Bongaarts and Potter, 1983, Figure 6), if analyzed with a Bhattacharya plot, also show distinct subpopulations, where two subpopulations (those with a mean of 4 and 13 children) resemble those of the Venezuelan population with a mean of 3.8 and 12 children (Table 1).
Sexual selection through female choice.-- Independent support to our findings (i.e., the existence of a high proportion of polyandrous females in human populations) comes from studies on sexual selection of animal genitalia (Eberhard, 1985). Morphological evidence indicates that sexual selection of genitalia through female choice is at work in most animal species, including primates. That is, Eberhard found that male genitalia are subjected to stronger selection pressures than female genitalia, thanks to female choice. Sexual selection of genitalia through female choice will occur (Eberhard, 1985) when (1) females normally mate with more than one male, and (2) a single copulation does not always result in fertilization of the female's entire complement of eggs. The latter is certainly true for humans (Tietze, 1960), and the former seems to be confirmed by our study.
In addition, data from British females support the hypothesis that females promote sperm competition (Bellis and Baker, 1990), adding to the evidence that females tend to be polyandric.

CONCLUSION
Our results contradict the prevalent assumption that humans are slightly polygynic and rather suggest that a more complex pattern exists, where interactions between polyandric females with monogamic andpolygynic males are common.
The analysis shows that human populations are a mixture of subpopulations with different fertility characteristics and that the fertility characteristics are not continuously distributed among a given population. Individuals seem to congregate at discrete fertility "optima." These optima could be placed on a r-K gradient (Rushton, 1985) where each may represent a specific adaptation, maximizing either population growth or possibilities of survival of a rather limited number of offspring. The fact that this r-K gradient is not continuous, as had been supposed by Rushton (1985), indicates the existence of a complex pattern of adaptive strategies in human populations which should be further investigated. Each blend of reproductive strategies, together with the specific fertility characteristics of the population, will produce aspecific assemblage of subpopulations based on fertility characteristics which will in turn produce specific fertility frequency distributions, which can be characterized,as

done here. This method allows us to compare populations with different cultures, detecting the various statistical subpopulations, estimating their relative proportions, and eventually telling us about the factors which allow these subpopulations to segregate statistically.
It would be of great interest to assess an eventual effect ofincreasing industrialization (and thus increased sophistication of larger populations) on basic reproductive behavior atthe population level. If the sex-related fertility differences are at least partly biologically determined, similar proportions of monogamic, polygynic, and polyandric individuals should exist inall human populations. To confirm this, we need to collect male fertility data through nationwide surveys worldwide, which will help us to get a deeper insight into our reproductive behavior. With this knowledge we may eventually formulate more effective policies for population control.
