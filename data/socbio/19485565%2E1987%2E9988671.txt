ABSTRACT: It has long been observed that married persons experience more favorable mortality than unmarried persons. Hypotheses about possible explanations for mortality differentials by marital status fall into three general categories: (1) hypotheses regarding errors in the data, (2) hypotheses related to the selection of persons into and out of marital states, and (3) hypotheses regarding environmental and behavioral factors associated with various marital states. In this paper the authors investigate the extent to which mortality differences by marital status are similar across populations and assess the importance of selection factors in producing the excess mortality of the single populations.

Hypotheses in the second category of explanations for mortality differentials by marital status suggest that marriage is selective. It selects healthier persons and leaves among the single a higher proportion of persons with serious health problems. Livi-Bacci (1984) suggests that marriage selection may operate in two ways: through temporary selection and through permanent selection. In the first case, marriage selects persons on the basis of their health at the time of marriage. Initially, married persons are freer of major health problems. However, this advantage is gradually lost with time as health problems not present at the time of marriage develop among married and single persons. Temporary selection also works through the decisions of persons to postpone marriage to a less hazardous period of their lives. Temporary selection would produce strong mortality differentials at short durations of marriage but would have no effect at longer durations, and the advantage of the married would tend to disappear. To test for the effects of temporary selection, mortality rates by marital status and duration of marriage would be required. These data do not currently exist.
In contrast to temporary marriage selection, permanent selection occurs when marriage selects constitutionally healthier persons, leaving among the single a relatively high proportion of permanently health-impaired or frail individuals. The effect of permanent selection on mortality differentials by marital status would be evident in a growing excess mortality of the single relative to the married up to the age at which very few additional single persons marry, after which excess mortality would remain constant.
Hypotheses in the third category include hypotheses positing a beneficial,

protective effect of marriage, hypotheses suggesting that changes in marital status and their effects produce mortality differentials, and hypotheses suggesting that mortality differentials by marital status are due to differences in unmeasured characteristics, such as smoking habits, which affect mortality and are correlated with marital status (Gove, 1973; Klebba, 1970; Helsing et al., 1981; Kobrin and Hendershot, 1977). For example, Gove (1973) and Kobrin and Hendershot (1977) argue that marriage protects against death by promoting social integration, which enrichesand lengthens life.
It islikely that a combination of selective and behavioral/environmental factors produce the observed marital status differentials. Marriage may select healthier persons and also protect those who marry. It is also possible that marriageis selective, but selects persons not according to health per se but rather on the basis of their ability to form social ties, which in turn promotes lower mortality. Experimental data in which women and men with known characteristics are randomly assigned to marital states would be required to conclusively distinguish the contribution of marriage selection, either permanent or temporary, and the contribution of various environmental and behavioral factors associated with marital states to observed differentials in mortality by marital status. Obviously, such experiments cannot be performed. Longitudinal data, including marital histories and duration in marital states, would augment and improve the observational data now available, but such data are very expensive to collect and tend to have sample sizes too small to study some of the effects of interest. Therefore, it is important to learn as much as we can about the explanations underlying mortality dif-

ferentials by marital status from crosssectional data currently available.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The objective of the present analysis is to assess the extent to which mortality differences by marital status are similar across populations and to determine the importance of selection factors in producing the excess mortality among the single populations. We focus our investigation on countries known to have high-quality mortality and population data, primarily countries in Western Europe. Using census tabulations and death registration data from these countries, we compare death rates by marital status across countries and within selected countries over time. Our primary tool for determining the existence of selection factors is a comparison between the magnitude of excess mortality for singlepersons and the relative size of the single population.
RESULTS
INTERNATIONAL COMPARISONS OF
MORTALITY DIFFERENTIALS BY MARITAL
STATUS
In Figures 1 and 21 we have plotted death rates by sex, age, and marital status for a small group of developed countries representative of a range of cultures (Sweden, Japan, England and

Wales, and United States whites2). In all cases, despite any differences in marriage behavior that may exist, married persons experience lower mortality rates relative to persons in all other marital states.
While the married consistently experience the lowest death rates in these countries, the ranks of the death rates of the other three marital states are less consistent. For example, single males have the highest death rates relative to widowed and divorced men in Japan and Sweden, but divorced men tend to experience the highest mortality in the United States and in England and Wales. For women in Sweden, Japan, and England and Wales, the single tend to have the highest death rates, but in the United States divorced women have slightly higher death rates. In addition, the differentials in death rates across the three nonmarried states for both sexes range from very large for Japan to virtually nonexistent for England and Wales.
In order to examine more systematically the extent to which mortality differentials by marital status are similar among developed countries, we gathered recent data on death rates by age and marital status for developed countries for which data are available. We applied a median polish procedure (Tukey, 1977) to these data to distinguish effects due to marital status from effects due to age and the general level of mor-

Median polish decomposes observed death rates by age and marital status into a common level of mortality and additive effects due to marital status, additive effects due to age, and residuals. For each country and sex, then, median polish produces a set of effects due to marital status, which can be thought of as the excess deaths per thousand attributable to each marital state relative to the typical or "aver-

age" death rate experienced by persons of all marital statuses, controlling for age.

and widowed persons (Klebba, 1970; Gove, 1973; Fox and Goldblatt, 1982; and Koskenvuo et al., 1980), the results in Figure 3a suggest that across developed countries there is no notable difference in mortality risks among these three nonmarried groups. The boxplots also indicate that the distributions of countries according to the mortality effects associated with each marital state are fairly compact.
The boxplots shown in Figure 3b are derived from the same data but show the difference between the death rates of married and nonmarried persons. For each country in the analysis, the mortal-

ity effect for married persons was subtracted from that of single, widowed, and divorced persons to obtain the relative mortality effects associated with each nonmarried state (i.e., the excess mortality rates of the unmarried relative to the married). The boxplots for both males and females confirm the observation from Figure 3a that the distribution of mortality effects are quite similar for all three nonmarried states. The relative mortality effects for females are smaller in magnitude than those for males, on average indicating excess deaths among the unmarried of two to three per thousand for females and eight to ten per

thousand for males, and the distributions of relative mortality effects for females across countries are more compact. There are several outliers for the males. In both Portugal and Japan the excess death rate of the single relative to the married is exceptionally high; in New Zealand, Portugal, Austria, and Norway the excess mortality of the widowed is particularly high, while in Bulgaria and East Germany it is especially low; and in Scotland the excess death rate of divorced men is exceptionally high. There are also several outliers in the boxplots for women. In Romania and Japan single women suffer exceptionally high excess death rates relative to married women; in Poland and Bulgaria the excess death rates of the widowed are especially low; and the excess mortality of divorced women is particularly high in Denmark, while it is especially low in Romania and New Zealand. These outliers possibly reflect different customs and attitudes in these countries toward persons of different marital states. For example, the exceptionally low excess death rates of the widowed are observed in East European countries where respect for elderly parents, especially widows, is likely to be greater.
MARRIAGE SELECTION: COMPARISONS
ACROSS COUNTRIES
It is clear that in developed countries married persons of both sexes experience a marked mortality advantage relative to single individuals. In order to explore the role of selective marriage behavior in producing the mortality disadvantage of the unmarried, correlation analyses between the magnitude of the excess mortality and the relative size of the unmarried populations were performed. The underlying hypothesis is

that populations in which the vast majority of women marry should be characterized by greater selectivity effects among those who remain single than populations in which substantial proportions of people never marry. If such selection exists, the correlation should be apparent at an age by which the majority of persons (who will eventually marry) have already done so. Livi-Bacci (1984) first tested the selection hypothesis by correlating the proportion single (never-married) at ages 40 to 44 with the ratio of the mortality rate of the single to the mortality rate of the married in the same age group. For females he finds a strong negative correlation (-0.60); for males the correlation is significantly weaker (-0.36). These results support the hypothesis that permanent marriage selection contributes to observed mortality differentials by marital status, especially for women. However, it is important to note that in the correlation for males, two outliers contribute heavily to the negative correlation. If Japan and Ireland are removed from LiviBacci's analysis, the correlation between the proportion of males who are single and the male mortality ratio falls close to zero (-0.07) and offers little support for the permanent selection hypothesis among males.
In order to examine the evidence for selection in a more general way, we carried out similar types of correlation analyses for a wider range of age groups on another data set from 26 developed countries around 1980.4 The correlation

cent), then the differential in death rates between the married and the single will be established at an early age, and the marriage of some of the more robust single women at later ages will raise the death rates of the single and of the married and may not change the differentials at all. To the extent that age is a proxy for marriage duration, the fairly constant strong correlation coefficients suggest that the effects of marriage selection are to a large degree permanent.
For males, the age pattern of correlation coefficients relating proportions single and excess mortality of the single does not show strong evidence of selective marriage behavior until the age group 45 to 54 years, when an average of only 8 per cent of men remain single. The different age patterns of correlation coefficients suggest that marriage selection is considerably weaker for men than for women. However, evidence presented in the next section implies that selection operates similarly for men and women within individual countries. Therefore, the different age patterns of correlation coefficients for men and women may be the result of differences among countries in marriage customs, particularly as they affect men.
MARRIAGE SELECTION: COMPARISONS
WITHIN COUNTRIES
Because international differences in nuptiality can confound our interpretation of the above correlation analyses, we studied the selectivity effect by analyzing cohorts of men and women from a single country over time. While marriage customs and the nature of marriage itself may change over time within a given country, these changes are apt to be much smaller than those across populations.

France was one of the countries chosen for the more detailed cohort analysis because of its generally high quality mortality data and the availability of death rates by marital status for a relatively long period of time. We examined the relationship between proportions single and ratios of the death rates of the single to the death rates of the married from three different perspectives. First we looked at the relationship from a period perspective by plotting the ratio of death rates of the single to the death rates of the married against proportions single for selected years ranging from 1886 to 1976. This has been done for French men in the first panel of Figure 4. The lines simply connect points for the age groups 20-24 to 35-39 in each given year. We observe from this graph that the relationship is negative in all years. In addition, the level of the relationship tends to rise in successive periods so that, over time, the death rate of the single relative to the married associated with each proportion single has increased. It is possible that this may be partially accounted for by our chosen measure of mortality differentials (ratio of death rates) and its behavior in the presence of changing levels of mortality, but, as we show later, we do not observe the same rise in all countries where mortality has been improving.
In the second panel of Figure 4, we examine the relationship between proportions single and ratios of death rates of the single relative to the married from the perspective of cohorts of French men. Here the lines connect points associated with the given cohort. Again the relationship is negative for every cohort for which we have data. As in the case of periods, the level of the relationship rises as we consider more recent cohorts.

tionship between proportions single and excess mortality of the single. However, the relationships, when viewed from the period and cohort perspectives (not shown), are flatter than those shown in the figures for France and Japan, indicating that a smaller increase in excess mortality of the single is associated with a given decrease in the proportion single. In addition, the correlations between proportions single and excess mortality of the single for specific age groups tend to be much weaker in the younger age groups for males in these countries, especially in Sweden; moreover, for Swedish males aged 35-39 and 40-44, the direction of the correlation is reversed. The weaker evidence for marriage selection in these data for Swedish males is not altogether surprising given the high level of informal cohabitation in Sweden present throughout the relevant period.
CONCLUSION
In this paper we have explored the role of marriage selection in producing the excess mortality among single relative to married persons consistently observed in developed countries. The role of marriage selection was investigated by examining correlation coefficients relating proportions single and the excess mortality of the single relative to the married from a variety of perspectives: across developed countries and, within select countries, from age, period, and cohort perspectives. The correlation coefficients are negative in nearly all instances, suggesting that marriage selection may be an important contributor to mortality differentials by marital status.
Previous analyses have suggested that there may be some differences between the sexes in the strength of selec-

tion and the role of selection as age progresses. These analyses as well as the cross-sectional comparison presented here indicate that marriage selection is more important in explaining differentials for females than for males. The fact that the individual country analyses do not show sex differences in the strength of marriage selection (except for Sweden), however, implies that the apparent sex differences may simply reflect greater variation in marriage customs among men across countries in the analysis. The very high correlation coefficients between the proportions single and the relative mortality rate of the single to the married for men and women in most age groups between 30 and 50 in France, Japan, and England and Wales suggests that much of the excess mortality of the never-married population in these countries is due to an important selectivity effect, i.e., health conditions appear to deter some persons from entering marriage.
Although this research has demonstrated the importance of selection in producing excess mortality risks among the never-married population, it offers us no guidance as to the potential existence of protective or mortality-reducing effects of marriage. As noted earlier, experimental data in which women and men with known characteristics are randomly assigned to marital states would be required to conclusively distinguish the contribution of marriage selection and the contribution of various protective factors to differentials in mortality by marital status.
