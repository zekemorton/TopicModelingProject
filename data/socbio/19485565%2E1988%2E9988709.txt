ABSTRACT: This paper examines the effects of nursing behavior on the duration of lactation amenorrhea in 382 rural Indonesian women who experienced resumption of menses while breastfeeding or were breastfeeding and amenorrheic at the end of a two-year prospective study. Three primary breastfeeding variables (number of night-time nursing bouts, number of day-time nursing bouts, and minutes per bout) were used to develop a behavioral model for breastfeeding. Four breastfeeding patterns were identified for these women. These were designated as: (1) low intensity, (2) medium-low intensity, (3) medium-high intensity, and (4) high intensity breastfeeding behavior. Menses resumed at medians of 11.2,16.0,17.6, and 20.8 months, respectively, for these groups. The relationships among the breastfeeding variables in the behavioral model and return to menses were developed and tested by life table and proportional hazards models. Ten per cent of the high intensity breastfeeding group (6 women) delayed menses between 33 and 52 weeks, while 90 per cent (56 women) postponed return of menses for over one year.

Huffman and coworkers (1987) have recently reviewed studies from both the developed and developing world which have investigated how varying patterns of breastfeeding affect the onset of postpartum fecundity. The consensus which derives from these studies is that the period of lactational amenorrhea and anovulation are dependent, either directly or indirectly, on the type of nursing practiced by the mothers. These conclusions are, however, based on only a very limited number of investigations, and the associations among breastfeeding patterns, practices, and resumption of fecundity postpartum have not been thoroughly investigated much beyond the clinical setting. This paper is designed to contribute to this growing and

important area of research in human population biology.
The present study is based on longitudinal data gathered in central Java and explores the association of postpartum suckling patterns and duration of amenorrhea in Indonesian women. From these data, a behavioral model for breastfeeding effects on fecundity (defined here as resumption of menses postpartum) is developed. The model that is presented is an extension of earlier research on this population, but here serves to clarify the relationships among the primary breastfeeding variables measured in the study, the actual nursing behavior practiced by each woman, and resumption of menses postpartum.

The importance of quantifying nursing behavior directly in these types of studies, as opposed to the use of duration of breastfeeding as a proxy variable for nursing behavior, has been demonstrated by the recent advances in the endocrinology of lactational and other types of amenorrhea. Current research suggests that alterations in luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion play a significant role in both clinical and postpartum amenorrhea. During the normal menstrual cycle, LH is released from the anterior pituitary in an episodic (or pulsatile) mode. The pulsatile secretion of LH occurs as a direct result of the pulsatile release of gonadotropinreleasing hormone (GnRH), a decapeptide secreted from neuroendocrine cells in the hypothalamus and reaching the anterior pituitary via the hypophysial portal blood system. The organization of GnRH neurons for the synchronous release of this decapeptide is generally referred to as a hypothalamic pulse generator (Knobil, 1980; Ferin et al., 1984). The integrity of the hypothalamic pulse generator is essential for normal menstrual/ovulatory cycles. In many clinical amenorrheic states the pulsatile secretion of LH is either altered or absent; and many of these conditions have been corrected by the exogenous, intermittent infusion of GnRH subcutaneously (Leyendecker et al., 1980; Crowley and McArthur, 1980; Glasieret al., 1986).
Alteration in the pulsatile secretion of LH appears to be responsible for postpartum amenorrhea and anovulation associated with breastfeeding as well. Stimulation of the nipple by nursing sets up a neuroendocrine reflex that reduces the ability of the hypothalamus to maintain pulsatile GnRH secretion and hence LH secretion, reduces the normal FSH:LH ratio, and retards fol-

licular development (Glasier et al., 1984; Glasier et al., 1986). The exact mechanism by which the suckling stimulus decreases GnRH output remains to be elucidated. It appears that the suckling stimulus itself acting either to inhibit the hypothalamic pulse generator neurons directly, or acting to induce betaendorphin inhibition of the hypothalamic pulse generator neurons, or possibly both, is largely responsible for postpartum lactational infertility (Ferin et al., 1984) Though highly correlated with suckling parameters, raised levels of prolactin, which have in the past been thought to cause postpartum amenorrhea and anovulation, apparently reflect the strength of the suckling stimulus rather than a direct causal mechanism in postpartum infertility (Ferin et al., 1984; McNeillyetal., 1985).
While the suckling stimulus can be seen as a direct link in a chain of events leading to postpartum lactational amenorrhea and anovulation, nursing is more than just a physiological phenomenon. Breastfeeding behavior embodies strong social and cultural norms which relate to the health and well-being of the mother/child dyad, nutriment of child, proscribed sexual activity postpartum, as well as to other aspects of social behavior (Neville and Neifert, 1983). Thus, while the contraceptive effect of breastfeeding is a complex mechanism at the physiological level, involving sequential phases of lactational amenorrhea, anovulatory cycles, ovulatory cycles with deficient luteal phase, and finally normal ovulatory cycles leading to conception (Howie and McNeilly, 1982), it is also a complex mechanism at the behavioral level. Not all women pass through all these phases, and ovulation and conception can precede first menstruation (Badraoui and Hefnawi,

1979), apparently due to the wide range in variability in breastfeeding behavior which is practiced in different societies.
Variation in duration of anovulation or amenorrhea postpartum should be seen, therefore, as a dose-dependent phenomenon, that is, one which is heavily dependent upon the frequency and intensity of the suckling stimulus. High frequencies of suckling have been found to be associated with extended periods of amenorrhea in studies in Bangladesh, Zaire, The Gambia, and among the !Kung Bushmen of Botswana (Huffman et al., 1980; Hennart and Vis, 1980; Konner and Worthman, 1980; Lunn et al., 1980). These types of dosedependent relationships are explored for Indonesian women in the present study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data for the research presented in this paper derives from the Ngaglik project, a prospective study undertaken between 1976 and 1978in a rural agricultural village, located 15 kilometers north of the city of Yogyakarta in central Java, Indonesia. Details of the design and aims of the study have been published elsewhere (The Ngaglik Study Team, 1976; Hull, 1984), as well as earlier findings (Bracher and Santow, 1982; Hull, J984; Santow and Bracher, 1984; Santow, 1987). Briefly, the sampling frame for the Ngaglik project was established from a household census and economic survey of two rural villages which identified 2,503 evermarried women in the age group 15-49. From this population, a group of 510 women was followed prospectively by monthly visits for two years until July 1978 when the field portion of the study ended. This group included those

women who had either reported they were pregnant or had a livebirth, stillbirth, or abortion between January 1, 1976 and the start of the study in May 1976. Besides data on the pregnancies and births, infant and child mortality, postpartum amenorrhea, abstinence and sexual relations, contraceptive use, and maternal and child health and nutrition, data on breastfeeding behavior and weaning were also collected.
The type of nursing behavior was elicited through recall at each monthly interview as the average number of suckling bouts which occurred during the day-time and night-time hours and the average minutes per nursing bout for the preceding month. Three primary breastfeeding variables, (1) average number of nursing bouts during the day, (2) average number of nursing bouts during the night, and (3) average minutes per nursing bout, were derived from these data for each woman. These variables were calculated as unweighted means over all the monthly visits up to the return of menses, censoring at the end of the study, or loss to follow-up, whichever occurred earliest. As a consequence, only breastfeeding data relevant to return of menses were used in the analysis (Habicht et al., 1985). Secondary breastfeeding variables, including the total number of bouts per day, total minutes of nursing during the daytime hours, total minutes of nursing during the night-time hours, and the total minutes of nursing during the 24-hour day were derived from the three primary variables for each woman.
The present analysis is concerned with the behavioral mechanisms of nursing and lactational infertility, so only those women who experienced return of menses while breastfeeding or were amenorrheic and breastfeeding at the

end of the study contributed information directly on nursing behavior and return to menses postpartum. Of the 390 women who met these criteria, 382 provided breastfeeding data and were included in the sample. The eight women who were excluded had provided retrospective data on their birth event, but had menstruated and weaned before providing monthly data on the type of breastfeeding behavior they had practiced.
The dependent variable in the study, the duration of postpartum amenorrhea, is defined following Delgado and coworkers (1982), as the interval (in days) between parturition and the first incidence of two menses occurring within a 90-day period. This more strict definition of return to menses tends to eliminate those cases where medical problems stemming from the pregnancy and delivery are mistaken by women in recall data as return of menses. These problems generally arise in the first few weeks following parturition, and if reported as menses, would tend to bias the estimate of the duration of postpartum amenorrhea downward. However, since the procedure also leads to more censoring than if single reportings are accepted as return of menses, the overall effect is probably to lengthen, slightly, the estimation of the average duration of amenorrhea. This bias, however, is expected to be small and to have no effect on the estimation of covariates of return to menses.
In the present analysis no attempt is made to distinguish between full and partial breastfeeding. In Ngaglik over 90 per cent of the infants were receiving supplementary food by the age of one month (Hull, 1984). The introduction of small amounts of food within the first

few days of the infant's life is a common practice among Javanese mothers and does not generally constitute a significant portion of the child's early diet (Geertz, 1961).
LIFE TABLES
Typically in prospective studies, events such as weaning, infant mortality, and resumption of menses postpartum are recorded with considerable accuracy, and the heaping associated with retrospective reporting of these events is avoided. However, because prospective studies tend to be of short duration--in the present study, two years of data gathering--censoring is unavoidable for the events where individuals do not have ending times, either because the study was concluded before they experienced the event or because they were unavailable for a follow-up visit at some time during the study. This was the situation in the present study where events were reported to the exact day from the reference birth with a high degree of accuracy, but for resumption of menses, only 260 of the 382 women considered here experienced a return of menses postpartum before the study ended. As a consequence, when life table analysis was applied to the data in the present study, the product-limit life table method of Kaplan and Meier (1958) was used to take into account the exact time during which each woman was at risk of menstruating regardless of whether menses had actually been observed. With the productlimit life table, failure probabilities are estimated at each distinct duration, in days, at which menses returned. These probabilities are the ratio of the number of women whose menses returned at that duration to the number of women still amenorrheic and at risk of resump-

tion of menses postpartum. The survival function for all observations derived from the failure probabilities is an estimate of the proportion of women who have not yet menstruated postpartum. A log-rank statistic (Generalized Wilcoxon) is used to test for significant differences between the survival functions for various groups. Life table analysis was used as a preliminary step in examining the effects of covariates on resumption of menses in this study.
PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODEL
The breastfeeding covariates of resumption of menses postpartum can be examined in a multivariate mode through the use of the proportional hazards model (Cox, 1972; Kalbfleisch and Prentice, 1980). This technique has found its most common application in clinical trials for the analysis of censored survival data where mortality risk varies among individuals. These data generally take the form of an observation on the survival of each subject, terminating in a predefined end-point (such as death or relapse of an illness after treatment) or censoring if the individual has been lost to follow-up or the study terminated and the event of interest not observed. Demographers typically use a more general form of the hazard model where the covariates may take different values at different times between two successive events (Trussell and Hammerslough, 1983). The more general form is used because the problems frequently considered in demographic studies, such as marriage dissolution (Menken et al., 1981) or infant mortality (Martin et al., 1983), have both time-varying covariates and censored survival data.
In this paper, the proportional hazards model is used in its original formu-

lation because the time interval under consideration (two years following a reference birth) is relatively short, and for the event considered (resumption of postpartum menstruation), the survival function gradually decreases in a monotonic fashion over the postpartum interval. The Ngaglik Study is not unlike a clinical trial, therefore, where each subject contributes certain background information and monthly information on breastfeeding behavior. Failure is defined as the return of menses postpartum and individuals are censored if lost to follow-up or the study terminated before menses returns. The underlying assumption in the model is that heterogeneity is captured by the set of covariates considered for analysis, and relative risks remain constant over the duration of the amenorrheic interval.

Details of the formulation of hazard models can be found elsewhere (e.g., Cox, 1972; Kalbfleisch and Prentice, 1980; Trussell and Hammerslough, 1983). Briefly, the hazard function is denoted by \(t,z) and is given by,

\(t,z) = Xo(0exp(pz),

(1)

where \(t,z) represents the instantaneous failure rate of postpartum amenorrhea at time t for a woman with a vector of covariates z, (3 is a vector of unknown regression coefficients to be estimated, and \0(/) is an arbitrary nonnegative, unspecified baseline hazard function not dependent on the covariates. Cox (1972) obtained estimates of p and an asymptotic covariance matrix using a partial likelihood argument. The methods and computer program used to estimate Cox's model in the present study were BMDP-2L (Dixon, 1985).
The model assumes that all women with the same covariates have identical

risks of returning to menses over the course of the study, but these risks may vary among groups with different covariates. When the model is estimated, an arbitrary baseline hazard function X0(t) is calculated for a specified reference group. The hazard function enables one to estimate the relative risksof the other groups in relation to this baseline group by exponentiating the regression coefficients, exp(3). Each exponential of the coefficients exp(p) in Equation (1) represents the effect of the covariate on the hazard function for the reference group. When there are no covariates present the exp((3) reduces to unity. Values greater than 1 indicate that the relative risk of resumption of menses postpartum is greater for this group, compared with the reference group, while values less than 1indicate a decrease in the risk.
The appropriateness of the assumption of proportional hazards, implicit in the use of multiplicative hazard models such as this, can be tested graphically by plotting /Ф[-/n(proportion remaining amenorrheic)] for the various covariate categories (Kalbfleisch and Prentice, 1980), or more formally, by allowing the covariates to vary as a function of time (Cox, 1972, p. 189). If the inclusion of the time-dependent covariate does not provide a significantly better fit to the data than that achieved by the original model, the effects of the explanatory variables are independent of the times at which failures occur. If on the other hand, a time-dependent covariate should prove significant, it can be included in the specification of the model.
One-way analysis of variance was used to assess difference between breastfeeding variables for the various groupings considered.

RESULTS
BREASTFEEDING MODEL
The recall data on breastfeeding in the study were numerical and continuous. To make the results comparable to those of other studies of the effects of breastfeeding on resumption of menses postpartum, the data were categorized. To do this, the product-limit life table method was applied initially to the quartiles for each of the three primary variables, minutes per nursing bout, number of day-time nursing bouts, and number of night-time nursing bouts. Optimum splits were obtained by the successive application of the product-limit life table around the quartiles and collapsing categories which were not significantly different from one another. Two optimum categories were found for each variable. For minutes per nursing bout, these were *s6 minutes and >6 minutes. For number of day-time nursing bouts, the categories were =s6 times and >6 times a day. Finally, for number of night-time nursing bouts, the optimum categories were =s3 times and >3 times at night.
Cross-classification by these three variables at their optimums results in a 2 x 2 x 2 table with 8 cells. These 8 cells, the fully saturated model, represent different breastfeeding patterns for this sample of women. For example, at one extreme, are those women who breastfed on average with the least intensity for each nursing variable. These values were ^ 6 minutes per bout, s=6 times during the day-time hours, and=Б3 times at night. This group of women had a median resumption of menses of 11.47 months (N = 17). At the other extreme were those women who nursed on aver-

age with the highest intensity. These values were >6 minutes per bout, >6 times a day, and >3 times a night. This group of women had a median resumption of menses of 20.35 months (N = 61). However, after applying life table analysis to the table and collapsing those cells which did not differ significantly from one another, only 4 different breastfeeding groups or "patterns" emerged. These results are summarized in Table 1 along with the nursing variables for this breastfeeding model. Figure 1 presents the survival functions for the four breastfeeding groups. At the upper extreme for breastfeeding, the "high intensity" group was the same. At the lower extreme, those women who breastfed ^ 6 minutes per bout, ^ 3 times at night, and >6 times during the day (N = 22); and those women who breastfed Фs6 minutes per bout, Ф;6 times a day, and >3 times at night (N = 2), both had early resumption of menses at medians of 10.78 and 4.83 months, respectively. Because these survival curves were not significantly different from one another and because their numbers were small, especially the latter group with only 2 women, these two groups were combined with the women who nursed with the least intensity for each of the primary variables under the heading "low intensity" breastfeeding group (N = 41). Those women who breastfed >6 minutes per bout, but Ф;3 times at night and =s6 times during the day, had a median resumption of menses of 14.01 months and were designated as "medium-low intensity" breastfeeders (N = 81). Those women who breastfed =s6minutes per bout, but both >3 times at night and >6 times during the day (JV= 14); those who breastfed >6 minutes per bout, >6

times during the day, but Ф3 times at night (N = 6); and those who breastfed >6 minutes per bout, >times at night, but =s6 times a day (N = 179), had medians for resumption of menses of 16.70, 16.50, and 17.95 months, respectively. These three groups, combined, resumed menses at a median of 17.65 months and were designated as "medium-high intensity" breastfeeders (N = 199). The survival functions for these four breastfeeding groups were significantly different overall (Model Generalized Wilcoxon = 54.713, p < 0.001), and for paired comparisons (Table 1). The category labels (low, medium-low, etc.) are used here merely as convenient labels to refer to overall patterns for breastfeeding for the various combinations of the three primary variables.
From Table 1we can see that, on average, over the postpartum period, low intensity and high intensity breastfeeders differed significantly from one another for all the breastfeeding variables. For the medium-low and mediumhigh groups the difference in the total number of nursing bouts over the 24hour period was due to the difference in both the number of day- and night-time bouts between these two groups. These differences are also reflected in the difference in the total minutes of nursing per 24-hour and the total minutes of nursing at night between these two intermediate groups. The lack of significance differences in total minutes of nursing per day between medium-low and medium-high breastfeeding mothers is due to the medium-low group having nursed on average more minutes per bout, while the medium-high group nursed with a higher frequency during the day-time.

Several recent studies which were designed to investigate the relationships between breastfeeding behavior and return of postpartum fecundity have used the total number of nursing bouts per 24-hour or the total minutes of nursing

per 24-hour as measures of breastfeed-

ing behavior (Delvoye et al., 1977;

breastfeeding groups (Figure 2). The total number of nursing bouts in 24

but the two intermediate groups did not differ significantly from one another for this variable. In a similar fashion, the low and high intensity breastfeeding groups were significantly different from one another for total minutes of nursing during the night-time hours, but the medium-high and high intensity groups were not significantly different from one another for this variable. These results indicate that all three of the primary breastfeeding variables, that is, minutes per nursing bout, number of day-time nursing bouts, and number of night-time nursing bouts, from which the model presented in Table 1is derived, are necessary to adequately distinguish the behavioral effects of breastfeeding on resumption of menses postpartum in this population. Any one of the three primary variables alone, or their first-order interactions (expressed here as total

number bouts in 24-hour, total minutes/ day, total minutes/night, or total minutes in 24-hour), does not adequately account for the variability in resumption of postpartum menses.
MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS
The adequacy of the breastfeeding model presented here for understanding the relationship between nursing behavior and resumption of menses postpartum can be further examined through the use of the proportional hazards model. In Table 2 the hazard coefficients p and exp(p) are presented for two main effects with interactions models for the three primary nursing variables. The first model contains the three main effects and one interaction term, while Model 2 introduces age as an additional covariate. Model 3

found to be significant. In addition, Models 1 and 3 have nearly equivalent model chi-squares, and as such, can be seen as being equally efficient in explaining the effect of breastfeeding on resumption of postpartum menses. While main effects models or main effects plus interactions models might be seen as being more parsimonious in a statistical sense, Model 3 is easier to understand in terms of human behavior and is preferred here. For example, the importance of the negative coefficient for the interaction of day-time and night-time nursing bouts in Model 1, when both their main effects are positive, is present in Model 3 as well. But the effect is present in the medium-low intensity breastfeeding group. These women breastfed on average ==s6 minutes per nursing bout. Minutes per bout for these women averaged just over 9 minutes, the longest for any of the breastfeeding groups (Table 1). While the first two main effects increase the risk of early resumption of menses (+ coefficients), nursing for more minutes per bout offset these effects somewhat when the effects are considered simultaneously (-- coefficient for the interaction). Because they breastfed for a greater number of minutes per bout, women in the medium-low group were at a lower risk of early resumption of menses compared to low intensity breastfeeding mothers who did not.
In the behavior model for breastfeeding in Table 1 (Model 3), with the three behavior variables considered simultaneously, an exp(p) of 4.58 for those who nursed their children with the lowest intensity means that their risk of menstruating is 4.58 times the risk of mothers who nursed with the highest intensity, other characteristics being the same. For the two intermediate breastfeeding

groups, the medium-low and mediumhigh breastfeeders, the risks of menstruating postpartum were 2.03 and 1.54 times, respectively, the risk for mothers nursing with the highest intensity, other variables being the same. The effect of age on return to menses was also introduced into the behavioral model (Model 4). With age included, the effects of the nursing behavior variables on return to menses remained constant relative to one another, as in Model 3, and significantoverall; and age was found also to be significant. An exp(Б) of 1.78 for women younger than 30 years of age means that the effect of younger age was to increase the risk of menstruating 1.78 times the risk for mothers 30 years or older, other characteristics being the case. Age had the same effect in the main effect plus interactions model (Model 2). As was the case with Models 1 and 3, Models 2 and 4 had nearly equivalent model chi-squares. As such, Model 4 can be seen as being equally efficient in explaining the effects of breastfeeding on resumption of postpartum menses as the main effects model with interactions. Finally, age did not interact significantly with any of the breastfeeding variables.
DISCUSSION
As mentioned above, studies which have attempted to quantify the effects of breastfeeding behavior on resumption of postpartum fecundity and fertility are still relatively few in number (see Huffman et al., 1987). Nonetheless, those which have, provide convincing evidence that the period of lactational amenorrhea is dependent on the suckling input in a dose-dependent fashion. The most convincing evidence derives from recent longitudinal, small-scale

320 Jones SocialBiology

clinical studies in Edinburgh, Scotland (Howie and McNeilly, 1982). Howie and McNeilly and coworkers have shown that a suckling frequency of more than 5 times and a total duration of breastfeeding of more than 65 minutes (minimum, 10 minutes per feeding bout) each day was sufficient to maintain complete suppression of ovarian activity for over a year in this Western setting. Reductions below these critical levels were,associated with the introduction of supplementary foods, less frequent night-time nursing, and subsequently, earlier onset of ovulation and menstruation. However, even when supplements were introduced early in the postpartum period, ovulation and menstruation remained suppressed if suckling was maintained at high frequencies for long durations (total minutes of nursing per day) (McNeilly et al., 1982, 1983; Howie et al., 1981, 1982a, b).
In the present study, breastfeeding patterns were maintained at relatively constant levels by the Javanese mothers over the postpartum period. This was seen in spite of a pattern of early supplementation which has been shown to alter breastfeeding behavior in other studies. The dose-dependent nature of the suckling stimulus in this population is, therefore, seen in the pattern for median resumption of menses across the different breastfeeding groups. The four breastfeeding groups in this study depict the range of nursing behavior and its effect on fecundity. Women who nursed less frequently during the day-time or night-time hours, or with fewer minutes per bout, had, on average, shorter durations of postpartum amenorrhea than those women who nursed more frequently or with more minutes per nursing bout. However, it appears that the

combination of these breastfeeding factors is more important than any single factor alone. These combinations translate into patterns of relative consistency in the suckling stimulus during a 24-hour period over the postpartum duration of lactational amenorrhea. At the extremes, high intensity and low intensity breastfeeding represent the most and the least amount of consistency in the suckling stimulus. When all three of these primary breastfeeding variables occurred together at their maximum values, resumption of menses was postponed the longest; when all three occurred in their minimum values, menses resumed the earliest. In between, various combinations of these breastfeeding patterns produced intermediate levels for resumption of menses postpartum. For example, women in the mediumlow breastfeeding group who maintained low frequencies of nursing during both the night-time and day-time hours, had the risk of early resumption of menses partially offset because they nursed for more minutes per bout. While there is clearly overlap between these groups, and therefore unexplained variability in the model, the overlap is most pronounced in the intermediate groups. At the upper extreme, for the 61 high intensity breastfeeders, the earliest resumption of menses was at 7V2 months, and only 5 women in this group resumed menstruation within one year (before 361 days). The comparable figure for the earliest onset of menses for the other three groups was, on average, 2V2 months. When age is taken into account among the high intensity breastfeeding group, the results are even more pronounced. The earliest resumption of menses for women in the 15-29 age category for high intensity breastfeeders was 7V2 months, while for women 30

years or older in this breastfeeding group the earliest resumption was at 12V2 months. The finding of a strong independent effect of mother's age on return of menses has not been consistently reported in the literature. Maternal age has been found to influence the duration of lactational amenorrhea in the Philippines, India, and Bangladesh, with younger women having shorter durations than older women (Chen et al., 1974; Jain and Sun, 1972; Potter et al., 1965). However, it is not clear from these studies whether this effect is independent of other factors since breastfeeding behavior was not explicitly controlled. In the study presented here, since the breastfeeding effect was controlled in the multivariate hazard analysis, the age effect reflects some biological or physiological mechanism, unrelated, at least directly, to the frequency or intensity of breastfeeding.
The present study contributes to our understanding of the biobehavioral mechanisms responsible for postpartum amenorrhea in breastfeeding women. It shows that the type of nursing behavior practiced by breastfeeding mothers is an important determinant of the resumption of menses postpartum. What has not been attempted, is to show which groups of women, for example, either women who are highly educated or not, wealthy or not, or of some other socioeconomic grouping, are most likely to practice the types of breastfeeding behaviors identified as important determinants of return of postpartum fecundity. This research will be presented elsewhere.
The results presented here demonstrate that further research of the breastfeeding effects on resumption of postpartum fecundity should include a combination of measures of nursing be-

havior, rather than just the total minutes
of nursing per day or the frequency of
nursing per day which are often re-
ported in these types of studies. This is
probably most critical for night-time
nursing patterns. That a combination of
breastfeeding factors or variables, in-
cluding night-time feeding, is more im-
portant than any one measure alone has
been shown in other studies as well
(Elias et al., 1987; Howie and McNeilly,
1982; Rivera etal., 1984).
In addition, the analysis demon-
strates the utility of hazards model
methodology as a multivariate tech-
nique for prospective interval studies
such as the one presented here. By their
very nature, these studies tend to have
limited sample sizes, relatively large
numbers of covariates, and censored ob-
servations. Hazard models appear to be
the most efficient way to handle such
data.
