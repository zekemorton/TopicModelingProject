ABSTRACT: Analysis of the fertility of Herero and Mbanderu pastoralists of the northern Kalahari Desert of Botswana indicates that they have suffered from infertility. The smoothed population pyramid constructed from a recent census shows waves of births occurring about every 22 years. Since generation times in human populations are typically longer, we suggest that infertility is responsible for prematurely terminating the reproductive spans of women, resulting in a reduced generation time. The eigenvalues of a series of Leslie matrices indicate that the periods of oscillation in the population have increased from 22 to 29 years following the recovery from infertility. Increases in fertility since the 1950's have also transformed the Herero from a slowly declining population to one growing at a rate of nearly 3.5 per cent per year.

Today there are probably 10,00015,000 Herero living in Botswana, comprising about 1percent of the total population.1 Most of them live in Ngamiland, the northwest district of Botswana.

parents was ascertained, while adults were ascertainable through parents, children, and spouses. However, for reasons described more explicitly elsewhere (Harpending and Pennington, 1991a), we have assumed the individuals we ascertained to be a random sample of the Herero population in Botswana.
The dates of most vital events were reported in either European calendar years or using traditional year names. Few Herero knew the Gregorian year in which an event occurred if it occurred less recently than about 1960, but most were able to date earlier vital events using a Herero or Mbanderu year name. Each year name typically reflects some important event occurring in that year. Since the name of the year in which an individual is born becomes a part of that person's identity, nearly every individual knows the name of his or her year of birth. Several year lists have been sequenced and aligned with Gregorian years. Lists published in Almagor (1980) and Vedder (1966) and supplemented by knowledgeable Herero we met were used to date the years of vital events reported to us in Herero and Mbanderu year names. Although there is some disagreement among sources about the correct sequence of some years, and although some error is introduced due to Herero years beginning and ending with the rainy season (usually in November or December), the use of Herero year names produced consistent dating of the years in which births and deaths occurred. In addition, this method is not biased by common problems of age estimation found in studies of other populations, such as age heaping on multiples of five (Brass, 1963).
Further details on the sampling and methodology used in this study can be found in Pennington (1990) and Har-

pending and Pennington (1991a). The compiled year list we used to date vital events is in Pennington (1990).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
AGE-SPECIFIC FERTILITY
Pockets of low fertility occur throughout Africa, and the causal relationship between subfertility and venereal infection in sub-Saharan Africa has been examined by Caldwell and Caldwell (1983) and Frank (1983). Fertility rates among Herero began increasing in the mid-1950's, and the correspondence between these increases in fertility and the widespread use of antibiotics in rural northwestern Botswana (Dam and Molosiwa, 1987) implicates infectious infertility as the causal agent there as well. Apart from the !Kung Bushmen, who have an average of 4 to 5 live births at the end of childbearing (Howell, 1979; Harpending and Wandsnider, 1982), this study is one of the first to describe subnormal fertility in a southern African ethnic group. It may be significant that the !Kung described by Howell, Harpending, and colleagues reside among Herero, who frequently employ them as cattlehands.
The transition from low to high rates of fertility experienced by Herero women is illustrated in Figure 1, which shows the age-specific fertility rates for three 10-year periods and for the period 1909 to 1956 (from Pennington and Harpending, 1991). These rates were calculated from a total of 12,774 person-years and 1,921 live births from the 611 female reproductive histories. Fertility among women of all ages is lowest in the earliest period, with a total fertility rate (the sum of 5 times the age-specific fertility rates) of only 2.65. An increase in fértil-

so that, again, there is no evidence to suggest underreporting ofdeceased offspring inthese data. Thesecondarysex ratio is also near unity, indicating that Herero are not preferentially reporting births of one sexmore than theother. Finally, when thefertility ofwomengiving birth inthe first period (1909-56) is separated into narrower time periods, the age-specific fertility rates are about the same. Thefertility rates of women reproducing in 1909-56 have beencombined inthis analysis dueto data sparseness atolder ages.
PARITY PROGRESSION RATIOS
While the changes inage-specificfertility rates illustrate the damping effect

of infectious infertility onfertility rates, the onset of secondary sterility isillustrated by theparity progression ratios (PPR's) in Figure 2 (from Pennington and Harpending, 1991). This figure is based onfertility histories of 239 postreproductive women (women atleast45 years oldin1986). Thefirstdata pointof the graph (i = 0)isatabout 0.85, indicating that about 85per cent ofthe women in this sample had atleast onelive birth. This primary infertility of 15%ishigh compared tomost natural fertility populations inwhich rates of2-3 per centare considered normal (Bongaarts and Potter, 1983).

Frank (1983), in which primary infertility rates were often as high as 40 per cent.
The rest of the data points on this graph show the proportion of women who, having had an ith birth, progress to have an / + Ith birth. The next data point at i = 1 is the proportion of women who, having had at least one birth, go on to have at least one more. The PPR's are around 0.75 for ratios 1 through 12 (corresponding to / = 1,2,3,...,12), after which they rapidly decline. The PPR of 0.75 indicates that about 25 per cent of all women become sterile after giving birth. This means that a woman of "proven fertility" is more likely to be sterile than a woman who has never given birth, since she has about a 25 per cent chance of being sterile compared to a nulliparous woman whose chance is only about 15 per cent.
The general shape of the Herero parity progression ratio curve indicates the nature of reproduction in this population. PPR curves that are concave downwards are characteristic of "natural" fertility populations (Howell, 1979), meaning that factors affecting the level of fertility in Herero are not strongly correlated with parity. In contracepting populations, these curves tend to be concave upwards as most women terminate childbearing at lower parities. Although the Herero PPR's appear to be relatively constant across parities, the jump at progression i = 5 suggests that there may be heterogeneity in the level of fertility in this group of women.
POPULATION STRUCTURE
Explaining the bumps and curves in a population pyramid is important, since what is learned from demographic analysis can reveal characteristics of a popu-

lation's history. Figure 3 (taken from Harpending and Pennington, 1991a) is the smoothed age-sex distribution of 2,591 individuals ascertained by us in 1987-89. This pyramid is representative of the living population in 1986. The top of the pyramid is fairly narrow but begins widening at the wave of births occurring about 20 to 30 years ago. The narrow structure of the pyramid at older ages is characteristic of a low fertility population, and the broadening and tapering of its shape initiated about 30 years ago coincides with the increase in fertility rates. Narrow population pyramids are also associated with populations with very high mortality, but this pattern does not describe the Herero, who have an expectation of life at birth of at least 50 years (Harpending and Pennington, 1991&).
Without smoothing, the population pyramid based on the raw data used to generate-Figure 3 is rough, jagged, and uninformative. Traditionally, demographers have collapsed these kinds of erratic data series into 5-year age-classes. This technique has the advantage of minimizing noise in population data, but, by the same token has the disadvantage in that it may also eliminate pattern. The pyramid in Figure 3 has been smoothed using a 4253H filtering algorithm recommended by Velleman and Hoaglin (1981). This algorithm illustrates pattern in the population structure but does not create an artificial wave.
The purpose of smoothing is to generate hypotheses, and a variety of them are suggested by the pyramid in Figure 3. First, the pyramid is asymmetric in that bulges on the female side of the pyramid appearing in the mid 1920's, 1940's, and 1960's are not as conspicuous on the male side. These apparent "missing males" suggest that male mor-

tality may be excessively high in this population, and in fact males do experience about three times the risk of mortality in infancy and about two times the risk of mortality in childhood relative to females (Harpending and Pennington, 1991a). Although this level of sexbiased mortality is unusually high, its cause is unknown.
This smoothed pyramid also shows an apparent wave originating early in the century, that is, among the oldest individuals in this sample. The wave is probably a result of the Herero population in Botswana being founded by adisproportionate number of young people following the flight from Namibia at the turn of the century. Figure 4 is a redrawing of a population pyramid constructed by Gordon Gibson based on a 1953 census of the Herero (Gibson, 1959). The individuals born in the years 1903 to 1868 in this pyramid represent the proportions of individuals who were aged 0

to 40 in 1903, when the refugee Herero population was founded. The age range represented encompasses most of the female reproductive span, and since a relatively small proportion of individuals of reproductive age founded the Herero population, a surge of births would follow as the refugee population matured. This birth surge would be echoed in subsequent generations. Although Gibson's sample is small, his pyramid is characterized by the same pinches and bulges suggested by the pyramid in Figure 3. Consequently, there is a greater basis for accepting Gibson's pyramid as representative of the age structure of the Herero of Botswana in 1953. Gibson's pyramid is also similar in shape to population pyramids of the Herero of Namibia constructed about the same time (Köhler, 1959a,b,c), suggesting that the age-structure in both Herero populations reflects excessive subadult mortality during the war.

GENERATION TIME ANDTHE
LENGTH OF WAVES
Natural periodicity is normal in human populations such that the wave resulting from a perturbation has a period about equal to the length of one generation (Keyfitz and Flieger, 1971; Keyfitz, 1972; Coale, 1972). That is, given a fixed set of fertility and mortality rates, a surge of births occurring at a particular point in time will be echoed a generation later when the excess births mature to reproduce themselves. Thus, the length of the period W2 is approximately equal to the generation time T (Keyfitz, 1968; Caswell, 1989), where Tis the number of years a population growing at a rate r will increase by a factor of the net reproduction rate (NRR), and the NRR is the expected number of baby girls born to a newborn female (e.g., Keyfitz and Flieger, 1971). Generation time can be derived from Lotka's renewal equation (Keyfitz and Flieger, 1971) in which exp'7" = NRR so that T - In {«5») T

has been shown to be equal to the mean age of childbearing ¡x. (Keyfitz and Flieger, 1971; Coale, 1972). Since the length of the generation time reflects the age at which reproduction is concentrated, populations with longer generation times have reproduction concentrated at older ages compared to populations with shorter generation times (Coale, 1972). The correlation between Tand /xindicates that the average mother in populations with longer generation times will be older than in those with shorter generation times, and it follows then that, all things being equal, the average grandmother must be younger as well.
A study of the female side of the Herero population pyramid in Figure 4 indicates that the length of the apparent wave is unusually short. Troughs in the apparent wave appear about every 22 years, several years shorter than calculations for most populations given in Keyfitz and Flieger (1971). Since the length of a wave is generally longer in human populations, the short wave

length in the smoothed pyramid suggests that shortened reproductive spans resulting from venereal infection during the first half of the century may be responsible for increasing the frequency of oscillation in the pyramid and, consequently, for reducing generation time and the mean age of childbearing in this population.
THE LESLIE MODEL
The length of a population wave can be derived from its Leslie matrix (e.g., Keyfitz and Flieger, 1971). The eigenvalues of a Leslie matrix have their analogues in the Lotka equation such that In \i = r, where \i is the dominant eigenvalue of the matrix. For i > 1, the \¡ are complex so that their relationship to the roots r¡in the Lotka model are not one-to-one (Keyfitz, 1968). Rather, the frequency of the natural periodicity is given by (Caswell, 1989)

where \2 is the second eigenvalue in magnitude with 3(\2) being the imaginary part and ÍR(\2) being the real part. To test the hypothesis that infertility has reduced the frequency of oscillation in the Herero population, we analyzed a series of Leslie matrices in order to identify temporal changes associated with increases in fertility. Four Leslie matrices were constructed using the four sets of fertility schedules calculated from the age-specific fertility rates in Figure 1. These are given in Table 1. The subdiagonals are the probabilities P, of surviving from the ith to i + lth age class. These are based on empirical estimates of survivorship that have been fitted to model life tables (H. Harpending, unpublished calculations). The F¡¡ are the fertilities of the ith age class for the yth period and are given by (Caswell, 1989)

Table 3 and the 1946 census figure as the baseline population, we estimate that the Herero population in Botswana would have grown to about 12,000 in 1986. Although population movement between Namibia and Botswana may affect these estimates, most of the migration of Herero is probably towards Namibia, the Herero homeland (Pennington, 1990).
Finally, recovery from infertility is responsible for transforming the Herero from a declining population into one experiencing extremely high population growth rates of about 3.5percent per year, a finding of great importance to policy planners in parts of Africa still characterized byhigh levels of involuntary infertility. The decrease in infertility has resulted in anincrease in the pe-

riod of oscillation in the population from about 22 to 29 years. Since the period of oscillation is approximately equal to generation time, which is correlated with themean age of childbearing ina population, these findings indicate that more children today arebeing born to mothers who are older than those in previous decades.
