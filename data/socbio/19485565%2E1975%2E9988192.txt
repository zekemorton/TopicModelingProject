Despite its potential social and demographic significance, illegitimate fertility is a difficult subject to study. There is not only the problem of identifying illegitimate births, but also the problem of estimating accurately the population exposed to the risk of illegitimate childbearing. We will discuss both of these problems on the basis of experience gained in a joint research project between the University of California, Berkeley, and the California State Department of Health. In this paper, we wish to present some of the methodological problems that emerged while developing illegitimacy data for California and the United States, report several studies we made in order to evaluate the California data, and make comparisons between our estimates for the United States and those prepared by the National Center for Health Statistics.
DETERMINING ILLEGITIMATE BIRTHS IN CALIFORNIA
The term "illegitimate," when applied to children, offends many people because it

seems to stigmatize children for something beyond their control. For this reason many states, including California, have eliminated the term "illegitimate" from the birth certificate and a large vocabulary of substitute terms has developed. As we have discussed elsewhere, there is nothing wrong with such terms as "children of unmarried mothers" and "out-of-wedlock children," although these terms tend to be cumbersome (Mulligan et al., 1974). More important, when the word "illegitimate" is tabooed, the assumption is that little more than moral stigma is involved. Our view is that the handicaps suffered today by illegitimate children result not so much from the moral opprobrium attached to the label "illegitimate" as from the circumstances in which the children are reared (Sklar and Berkov, 1974a; Cutright et al., 1974). Thus, removing the word "illegitimate" does not eliminate the phenomenon itself. What is crucial in any study of illegitimacy is to be able to identify illegitimate children, not for the purposes of attributing stigma, but rather to investigate their number and characteristics and what happens to them in later life.
With no legitimacy question on the birth

record, data with respect to illegitimacy in California cannot be obtained except by inferring the information from what is stated on the birth certificate. Such an inferential method was developed in California in the late 195O's and early 196O's by several large local health departments and was applied on a statewide basis beginning in 1966 (Berkov and Shipley, 1971). The method provided criteria for dividing birth certificates into two groups: those apparently out-of-wedlock and those apparently legitimate. The classification was based mainly on a comparison of the surname of the child with the surnames of the parents, including consideration of the name given by the mother when she signs the birth certificate as the informant for the birth record.
For representative samples of births classified illegitimate in 1967 and 1970, we reviewed the coding of the certificates

and compiled data on the frequency with which each criterion had been applied (Berkov, unpublished). Our findings were very similar for both 1967 and 1970 (see Table 1). In both years, approximately one-fifth of the certificates were classified out-of-wedlock because the father's name had been omitted. This omission was much more frequent for white than for Black births reflecting the fact that white babies were more frequently adopted. For about an additional one-fourth of the sample, the mother had named a father, but she had given the child her own surname rather than that of the man she named (again, more often for white than for Black). For approximately half the cases, the mother had named a father and had given his name to the child. In these cases, the certificate had been classified out-of-wedlock because the mother had signed it either with her maiden name (almost two-fifths of the

sample) or with a current married name indicating that she was divorced, widowed, or possibly separated (12 per cent of the sample). The very large proportion of cases in California in which the mother gives the baby the same surname as the father probably results from a state attorney general's opinion dating from 1945 which specifies that a mother may give to her child any surname she wishes. In California, hospitals frequently either inform unwed mothers of this attorney general's opinion or they may deliberately refrain from giving any advice to the mother in regard to naming the child.
In undertaking to use the California data on illegitimacy in our research, we had to make an initial judgment that the inferential criteria as applied to birth certificates probably were valid and were not either missing large numbers of illegitimate births (false negatives) or identifying large numbers of legitimate births as illegitimate (false positives). Visits to local health departments and hospitals and several pilot studies provided initial evidence that the inferential method was probably not producing overestimates of the number of illegitimate births (Berkov and Shipley, 1971, p. 4).
In investigating various means to check more systematically the accuracy of the inferential method, we found that a number of hospitals in the state either compiled their own counts of illegitimate births or maintained logs of deliveries that could be used to compile such counts. We concluded that the best test of the validity of the inferential method used in California would be to compare, for as many of these hospitals as possible, the number of illegitimate births shown by hospital records with the number obtained by application of the inferential method.
We were able to make such comparisons for six hospitals (see Table 2). I t is clear

that there is some variation among hospitals, as one would expect, but the remarkable thing is the close overall agreement between the two counts. For all hospitals and time periods combined, the birth certificate method identified 13,311 illegitimate births or 27.9 per cent of the total births, as compared to the hospital count of 13,396 illegitimate births or 28.2 per cent of total births.
The evidence indicated that there was little misclassification of legitimate births as illegitimate and that few illegitimate births were missed. It appeared that the information about the mother's marital status inferred from the birth certificate corresponded to the information the mother had given to the hospital for their own records. Although it would be desirable to have a larger sample of hospitals, and although there is need for future periodic checks, the evidence obtained thus far indicates that the inferential method being applied to birth certificates in California is a valid procedure and is not overestimating the number of illegitimate births in the state.
COUNTING ILLEGITIMATE BIRTHS IN THE UNITED STATES
One of the most important uses we made of the inferential data for California was to show that legal abortion had depressed overall fertility, particularly illegitimate fertility, in 1971. Extending this study to other states, we focused on the period 1965-71 and compared the fertility experiences of states with and without legalized abortion in 1970 (Sklar and Berkov, 19746).
This interstate study of abortion and nonabortion states faced two problems. First, the birth data by legitimacy that were available from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) referred only to states having a question about legitimacy

on the birth certificate, and California and New York were among the nonreporting states. Since California and New York accounted for most legal abortions performed in the country in 1970 and 1971, it was essential to obtain birth data by legitimacy from these states (Center for Disease Control, n.d., p. 6; 1972,p. 3). The second problem was that NCHS was delayed in the preparation of birth data by legitimacy

for 1969 and later years. As a result, we obtained the more recent data for the interstate study by communicating directly with all states, including states that did not have a legitimacy question on the birth certificate butnonetheless used information on thebirth record to infer apparent legitimacy status.
Of the states responding to our inquiry, 44 provided adequate information forde-

tailed tabulation. These states accounted for 95.8 per cent of all United States births in 1968. On the basis of the data from these 44 states, we developed estimates of birth rates by legitimacy status for the United States as a whole cross-classified by age, race, geographical region, and availability of legal abortion in 1970. We have discussed the findings of this analysis in other papers. Here we are concerned with methodological questions raised by our use of a somewhat different procedure for estimating illegitimate births than that used by the NCHS (Guerriero and Tsai, unpublished).
How does NCHS prepare an estimate for the nation on the basis of states with a legitimacy question on the birth certificate? In making the national estimates, NCHS assumes that these states represent the entire geographical division. The number of states with questions varies in different years.1 In 1973, 38 states had a legitimacy question on the birth certificate, but 12 states did not--California, Connecticut, Georgia, Idaho, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Vermont, and Nevada. The 12 nonreporting states contained over 30 per cent of the nation's births in 1973 (National Center for Health Statistics, 1975, and unpublished data). In making the national estimates, NCHS assumes that the ratio of illegitimate to total births is the same within each geographical division for the reporting and nonreporting states, taking each race group separately (white and nonwhite for 1968 and earlier years; white, Black, and other for 1969 and later years).
1 There were 16 nonreporting states in 1965-67, 10 in 1968, 11 in 1969-70 and 12 in 1971-73. Not reporting for the entire period 1965-73 were California, Connecticut, Georgia, Idaho, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, New Mexico, New York and Vermont. Not reporting in 1965-67 but reporting in 1968-73 were Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Nebraska, New Hampshire and Oklahoma. Nevada reported in 1965-70, but discontinued reporting in 1971-73; Ohio reported in 1965-68, but discontinued reporting in 1969-73.

It should be noted that among the reporting states, the legitimacy question is phrased differently in different states; most states ask simply "Legitimate? (yes or no)," while a few states phrase their question "Is mother married?" or "Is mother married to father?" NCHS has not evaluated the accuracy with which the legitimacy question has been answered in the reporting states (Clague and Ventura, 1968, p. 1). Probably, some illegitimate births are reported as legitimate.2
In this paper no attempt is made to evaluate the validity of data from states having a legitimacy question on the birth certificate or to determine the amount of error that might have been introduced into the data for the 1940's and 19S0's by the NCHS assumption that reporting and nonreporting states in the same geographical division are similar. Since about the mid1960's, however, the large nonreporting states have been applying inferential methods. Our studies incorporating the data from these states show that in some geographical divisions at least, the assumed similarity between reporting and nonreporting states is open to question, particularly in regard to the absolute number of illegitimate births occurring each year.
In California, for example, application of the NCHS method produces a figure substantially below the number obtained by using the inferential method (see Figure 1 and Table 3).3 For 1973, the national total
2 Underreporting of illegitimate births was demonstrated in one study in the state of Washington where most births are to white women (Washington State Department of Health, 1962). Underreporting has been said to be more frequent for white than for Black births (Cutright, 1972, p. 429).
3 This finding was in sharp contrast to what the NCHS found in their evaluation study of one month's births in 1963. In this evaluation study, NCHS developed inferential criteria from a sample of birth certificates in reporting states. These criteria then were applied to birth records in the nonreporting states; the number of illegitimate births obtained by application of the inferential

it was higher by a small amount (22,361 vs. 21,455), and it was also higher in 1971 and 1972, although lower in 1969 and 1970. Evidently, the nonwhite experience of the two reporting states in the middle Atlantic division--Pennsylvania and New Jersey-- was not representative of New York in that it failed to reflect the effect of New York's legal abortion law on nonwhite illegitimate births in the state in 1971-73.
When the NCHS estimates by divisions in 1965-71 are totaled to the United States

as a whole, they yield national figures for illegitimate births well below our own estimates (see Figure 2 and Table 5). For most years, they were 5 to 6 per cent below our estimates. For every year in the 196571 period, the two methods produced a greater discrepancy for whites than for nonwhites. For whites, the NCHS method showed less rise in illegitimate births between 1965 and 1970, and then less decline in 1971, than did the figures that included inferential data.

This discrepancy probably occurred because the NCHS estimates excluded direct evidence from New York, California, and other nonreporting states where, compared to reporting states, white illegitimate births rose more rapidly in the late 1960's and then, as a result of legal abortion, declined more sharply in 1971. For nonwhites, the two methods showed approximately the same relative rise in number of illegitimate births between 1965 and 1970. However, the NCHS method failed to reflect as much dampening of the rise in 1971 by legal abortion as did the figures using inferential information. Finally, for all races combined, the NCHS estimate of illegitimate births showed a rise between 1970 and 1971,while the inferential data showed a drop between the two years.

Because the nonreporting states account for a large proportion of all births in the country in any one year, it is evident that the incorporation of inferentially derived information from these states produces a more sensitive measure of illegitimacy trends. When the problem is to evaluate the impact of legal abortion on legitimate and illegitimate fertility, as was the case in our studies, it is essential to include such inferential evidence because many of the nonreporting states have high legal abortion rates. For broader analysis of the trends, the difference may be less important. On the whole, although we have not evaluated the inferential data from states other than California, our validation of the California information leads us to believe that national estimates incorporating inferential data are

babies by men other than their legal husbands and that since they frequently named the other man as the father of the child these births were being classified illegitimate. This finding raised the question of how to calculate the illegitimate birth rate, because the rate is strongly influenced by inclusion or exclusion of separated women (along with those single, widowed, and divorced) in the population at risk.
Separated women comprise a large proportion of Black women in the childbearing ages, particularly Black women age 25 and over. In California in 1970, among Black women aged 25-34, 13.6 per cent were separated and 11.3 per cent were divorced. The comparable figures for the United States were 13.8 per cent and 6.4 per cent (see Table 6). Inclusion of separated

women were being included in counts of illegitimate births in California was confirmed by data we obtained as a by-product of a study of high-risk pregnancies in three hospitals in the San Francisco Bay Area. In the three hospitals studied, records of normal and complicated deliveries in 1973 were abstracted. From information in the case record, the apparent legitimacy status of the child was determined, using the same definition of illegitimacy as is approximated by the inferential method, i.e., that the mother was not married to the father of the child. For all cases classified illegitimate, information from the hospital record was obtained about the specific marital status of the mother.
The sample consisted of 1,237 live births of which 324 were classified illegitimate. As shown in Table 7, among the mothers of the illegitimate babies, we found that while most (84 per cent) had never been married, the percentage separated was almost as large as the percentage divorced (7 per cent vs. 8 per cent). Among the Black mothers in the sample aged 25 and over, 17 per cent were separated and 21 per cent divorced. Thus, there seems little question that, at least in California, separated women having children by men other than their husbands are being included in the counts of illegitimate births and therefore that separated women cannot be excluded from the denominators that are used to calculate illegitimate birth rates.6
Another reason for our decision to consider separated women at risk in both "our

The suspicion that births to separated

5Separated women also may be having babies by their legal husbands, although our contacts with hospitals and our work with birth certificates in California have not indicated that this is a large group. It would be desirable in calculating rates to distinguish between the two groups of separated mothers and also to estimate the proportion of separated women in the population who have lived apart from their husbands for more than nine months and thus are not likely to be at risk of having a legitimate child. At present, however, these data are not available.

lation at risk by excluding the separated. In 1969 and 1970, however, the NCHS estimates failed to pick up particularly sharp rises in illegitimacy that had occurred in nonreporting states. The maximum difference was in 1970 when our rate was 14.5, or 4 per cent above the NCHS rate of 13.9. Since the NCHS rates showed less rise in illegitimacy in 1969 and 1970, they also showed less decline in 1971 associated with theincreased availability of legal abortion. Nevertheless, both sets of rates showed the same trend--still confining our attention to whites--before and after 1970.
For the various age groups of white women, our rates show no constant differences from those of NCHS. Our study rates are higher for younger women, but lower for older women. Among teenagers in 1970, for example, the interstate study rate was 8 per cent above the comparable NCHS rate (11.8 vs. 10.9), while for women aged 25-34, it was 3 per cent below the NCHS figure (17.8 vs. 18.4). Our higher teenage rates resulted from the larger number of illegitimate births obtained by including inferential data; but our lower rates at

Rates were calculated by varying denominators but using only one set of numerators. Births by legitimacy are published NCHS figures derived by extending experience of reporting to nonreporting states. Denominators are 1970 census figures.

older ages resulted from the inclusion of separated women in the population at risk. Although we counted more illegitimate births for older white women, this fact was more than compensated for by theinclusion of separated women.
As for nonwhite women, our rates throughout the 1965-71 period are lower than the NCHS rates by 16 to 26 per cent, mainly because we have treated separated women as exposed to the risk of out-ofwedlock chiidbearing. Since the proportion

closely the actual incidence of out-ofwedlock childbearing. Further improvements in measuring illegitimacy could be achieved if there were better understanding and agreement about the practical and analytic purposes to be served by thelegitimacy question on the birth certificate.
It is likely that the legitimacy question will be rephrased in order to drop the term illegitimate. The next revision of the standard certificate of live birth will recommend that the question "Is mother married?" replace the question "Legitimate? (yes or no)."In interpreting either the new question or the old, considerable confusion can be avoided by recognizing that by whatever name it is called illegitimacy remains the same phenomenon and data about it are needed to understand its personal and social consequences. Because illegitimate childbearing remains at high levels in the United States, there is need for continuing evaluation and improvement of the data.
