Research on knowledge and practice of family planning in Pakistan has been primarily descriptive. Generally, simple percentage distributions of these variables have been reported with no attempt to relate them to other factors. This has been the pattern of reporting in studies conducted by the major research organizations of the country (Central Evaluation Unit, East Pakistan, 1966; Central Evaluation Unit, West Pakistan, 1967; East Pakistan Research and Evaluation Center, 1968; Family Planning Association, 1966; National Research Institute of Family Planning, 1966).
In light of this lack of analytical research, the present study is necessarily exploratory. It will attempt to identify factors related to knowledge and practice of family planning, and hence the segments of the population reached by the family-planning program, and also to identify groups where fertility decline may be expected. The factors focused upon are socioeconomic status (occupation, education, landholding), cooperative membership, family type, religion, age, and total living children.

The study was conducted in 1967 under the auspices of the Pakistan Academy for Rural Development, Comilla, East Pakistan. The Academy conducts rural development programs (Family Planning, Women's Education and Home Development, Agricultural Extension, Youth Education, etc.) on an experimental basis for possible adoption at the national level. As early as 1961, the Academy initiated a pilot family-planning program utilizing the "organizer approach"1 (A. M. Khan, 1963; Stoeckel, Khan, and Choudhury, in press) in four villages of the experimental area, ComillaKotwali thana.2 By 1964, the number rose to twenty-two. In the latter part of the year, a new program which covered all villages of the thana was implemented utilizing commercial distribution channels for sale of contraceptives (A. H. Khan and Choldin,
1 The "organizer approach" utilized village women (organizers) who were nominated by their local cooperative society for training and instruction in family planning at the Academy. Upon completion of training, they conducted the following activities in their villages: visited with village women and discussed and explained all facets of family planning; sold contraceptive supplies (condoms and foam tablets); and kept systematic records on women who purchased contraceptives.

1965). The following year an IUCD clinic was established.
METHODOLOGY
The data for the study were collected by interviewing all married couples (2,078) in fifteen villages of Comilla-Kotwali thana in the first three months of 1967. Information on knowledge and practice of family planning was elicited from wives by female interviewers, and social and economic data from husbands by male interviewers.3 Initially, only females were to be interviewed; however, in pretesting, it was found that the majority of women were unable to give information concerning their husbands' occupations, education, and landholdings.
The fifteen villages were initially selected because surveys had been conducted in them at an earlier time (ten of the villages in 1962, and five in 1964) and baseline data on family planning had been collected. The original selection of the villages was purposively made, and randomness cannot be assumed.
Knowledge of family planning was obtained by asking the respondent, "Do you know any methods of family planning?" and if so, "Name the methods you know." If the respondent was unable to name methods, knowledge was not established. Knowledge in this sense simply refers to the respondent's awareness that there are ways to limit family size and does not imply that he would actually know how to use a method.
Data on practice of family planning were collected to identify couples currently practicing and those who had ever practiced. The questions which elicited these data were: "Have you ever used any methods of family planning?" If so, "What methods did you use?" "Are you still using any meth-

ods?" The couples who are currently using contraceptive measures plus those who no longer use them make up the total number of couples who have ever practiced family planning. This gives an indication of the potential total number of users that would have been expected had all couples continued practicing family planning.
In order to see if there was a relationship between the selected factors and knowledge and practice of family planning, a simple chi-square test of independence was applied. The null hypothesis was that there would be no differences between the groups comprising the factors (socioeconomic-status groups, members and nonmembers of cooperatives, joint and single families, Muslims and Hindus, age groups, and number of living children) in the proportion of members who have knowledge of and have practiced family planning.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The first portion of this section describes the total distribution of knowledge and practice for all fifteen villages. In the remaining portion, the relationships between the selected factors and knowledge and practice are analyzed.
As seen in Table 1, over two-thirds of the couples knew about family planning. (A study of five of the fifteen villages in 1964 found that only 4% of all couples had any knowledge of family planning [A. H. Khan and Choldin, 1965].) In contrast, only 7% had ever practiced family planning, and about 5% were currently practicing it. This would seem to indicate that, administratively, the program had been fairly successful in reaching the majority of the couples since knowledge was high. However, conventional contraceptive practice does not appear to be substantial enough in this area to realize the government's goal of a 20% reduction in the crude birth rate by 1970.

One possible explanation for the extremely low proportion of couples practicing is that there is some sort of "stigma" connected with family planning and respondents will not admit they practice it. (The majority of interviewers felt that in many instances this was the case.) The data afforded a rather unique instance for a partial test of this proposition. Three of the villages in the sample were under the "organizer" program where data on monthly purchases of contraceptives by couples were systematically collected. Hence, we had a situation where the responses to knowledgeand-practice questions by couples who were known users could be compared to their actual behavior. Unfortunately, only 22 couples fell into this category, a number hardly large enough to draw any positive conclusions. Nevertheless, the findings are still important. While only two respondents indicated they had no knowledge of family planning, about half (10) said they had never practiced it. Depending, of course, on the extent to which this result is representative, it has obvious implications for the interpretation of success or failure for familyplanning programs. That is, KAP (Knowledge, Attitude, Practice) studies may show practice to be lower than it actually is and conclude that it is not high enough to effect a decline in fertility. This could result in unnecessary and wasted efforts at program change. Hence, interpretation of KAP data, particularly for the rural area of East Pakistan, must recognize, or at least take into account, the possibility that there is a "stigma" connected with family planning and interpret results accordingly.
SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS
Husband's occupation and education show a significant relationship with knowledge about family planning.4 The highest status groups (Business and Skilled and Class 7 + ) have higher proportions with planning knowledge than the re-

maining groups. In contrast, there are no significant differences between the proportions of landholding5 groups who have knowledge of family planning (see Table 2). Similarly, there is no significant relationship between any of the status indicators and the proportion currently practicing (see Table 3). While education and landholding are not related to "ever practiced," occupation shows a significant relationship. The Business and Skilled occupations have the highest proportion, while Farming has the lowest (see Table 4).

tice of family planning. Even though the high occupational status groups show significantly higher proportions who have ever practiced, those who are currently practicing represent no particular stratum.
COOPERATIVE MEMBERSHIP
Members and nonmembers of cooperative societies do not differ significantly in their knowledge about family planning.

However, members do have significantly higher proportions currently practicing family planning and who have ever practiced it (see Table 5).
These findings most probably have resulted from the part the cooperative societies have played in implementing the family-planning program. In the earliest stages of the program, the societies were utilized as the major vehicle to convey

family planning to the populace. Since members initially were more exposed to a concentrated effort than nonmembers, it would follow that they may be more predisposed to try and practice family planning.
FAMILY TYPE
Although the proportions of persons in single families who have knowledge of and practice family planning are higher than in joint families,6 the differences are not great-

er than would be expected by chance (see Table 6). These results have implications for the dialogue concerning fertility differences between family types. One argument is that fertility will be higher in single families due to greater privacy (coital frequency will be higher) and the absence of relatives to enforce religious sanctions
6 A single family was defined as a family composed of parents and their unmarried children who take food from the same kitchen, while a joint family was a simple family plus one or more consanguineous relatives who take food from the same kitchen.

regarding periods of abstinence (Nag, 1965). The other position is that fertility will be higher in joint families since they can more easily (economically) accommodate an extra child (Chandrasekar, 1955; Davis, 1955). Also, the cooperation and assistance the couples receive from other members of the joint family in rearing their children maybe unfavorable to the development of a strong motivation toward family planning (Mathen, 1962).
The findings here seem to indicate that family type makes no difference; there seems to be little, if any, immediate fertility

difference resulting from the practice of family planning between family types.
RELIGION
Religious affiliation shows a significant relationship with knowledge and practice of family planning (see Table 7). The proportion of Muslims who have no knowledge of family planning is double that of Hindus. The proportion of Hindus currently practicing family planning is almost three times as great as Muslims, while the proportion who has ever practiced it is twice as great. A most striking result is that almost 90% of

the Hindus who have ever practiced family planning are still practicing, compared with 60% for Muslims.
These results indicate that the welldocumented Hindu-Muslim fertility differential (Davis, 1951; Nag, 1962; Saxena, 1965; Sinha, 1957), showing higher fertility among Muslims, should continue to be maintained. The results also interject another factor that must be considered in the differential, namely Hindu contraceptive practices. Up to this point, the explanation of the differential has been couched primarily in terms of religious customs. For example, Kirk (1965) maintains that ritual abstinence is less common among Muslims than Hindus, although Muslims observe abstinence during the daylight hours of Ramadan. Hindu customs require prolonged abstinence following childbirth, and frequently the mother must return to her parents' home for confinement. Thus, postpartum separation is likely to be longer for Hindus than for Muslims. Kirk says further that these factors may explain the fertility differential despite similar patterns of early marriage and high proportion of reproductive life spent by women in marriage.
Prior to family-planning programs, this explanation may have been sufficient. In light of the present results, however, the explanation must go beyond the reasons for the fertility differential to the reasons for the differential in contraceptive practice. Obviously, these reasons cannot be provided by the present data. Additional research is necessary to examine the attitudinal, social, and demographic factors which may be associated with the greater practice of family planning among Hindus.
AGE or WIFE
The age structure of wives shows a significant relationship with knowledge and practice of family planning (see Table 8). The highest proportion with knowledge

occurs in the 25-29 year age group and the lowest in the youngest age group, 15-19 years. The group 30-34 years of age has the highest proportion currently practicing and who have ever practiced, while the youngest group has the lowest. All of the age groups thirty years and older have higher proportions currently practicing than the groups below thirty years. Similarly, the age groups thirty years and older have higher proportions who have ever practiced.
The age groups which have the highest fertility (20-24 and 25-29 years) have the lowest proportions practicing family planning. In addition, the age group 25-29 years, which has the highest fertility of the entire age structure, has slightly less than half of the women currently practicing who had ever practiced. This is the lowest proportion of all the age groups. Thus, the impact of family planning will occur in the older portion of the age structure where couples already have large families and are generally practicing birth control to maintain their current size. Hence, the overall reduction in fertility will not be as great as it would be if the younger portion practiced family planning at the same rate.
NUMBER OF LIVING CHILDREN
Number of living children is significantly related to knowledge and practice of family planning (see Table 9). Knowledge is highest for couples with 4 or 5 children, followed closely by couples with 6 or more. The proportions currently practicing and who have ever practiced vary directly with number of living children. The proportion of couples currently practicing family planning who have 4 or more children is over twice as great as that of couples with 1 to 3 children; the proportion of couples with 4 or 5 children who have ever practiced family planning is twice as great as that of couples with 1 to 3 children and three times as great as that of couples with 6 or more children.
The results indicate that practice of
