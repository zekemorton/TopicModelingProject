ABSTRACT: Socioeconomic determinants of fertility and mortality were estimated by regression analysis for 29 low-migration SMSA's located in the eastern part of the U. S. A low-migration sample was chosen to maximize length of life history within the regions. Independent variables included per cent nonwhite, gross and net migration, population, density, medical care, welfare, per cent Catholic, education, income, and labor force participation. Density was measured by an index based on the census inventory of urban land. Mortality results include effects of migration on older nonwhite life expectancy, an inverse effect of density on life expectancy for older whites, specific income and educational effects on older life expectancies, different causative factors for e(50)and e(1,50),lack of influence of medical care (except for the nonwhite male), and significant infant mortality multiple correlations only for the nonwhite female. For nonwhite fertility, the inverse influences of per cent nonwhite and net migration 1960-70 were of greatest importance. White fertility showed a negative relationship with medical care and a positive one with nonwhite male e(0).

local administrative units in eighteen Latin American nations. Closer to the present investigation was a later study by Heer and Boynton (1970) of differences in fertility in 591 U.S. counties in 1960. Fertility was measured as the ratio of actual to expected births. Variables found to have the greatest contribution to r2 were per cent Roman Catholic (positive factor), a density index (negative), and proportion nonwhite (positive).
In a study of the effect of ten demographic and socioeconomic characteristics on the total fertility rate in 1961 for 29 regions of the Italian province of Venezia (De Sandre, 1971), the independent variables of most importance for regression (in order of size of standardized coefficients) were per cent of voters Christian Democrat (positive), amount of urban centralization (negative), persons per room (positive), per cent with secondary education (positive), and female employment (negative).
In a nonregional research project on ethnic and age differences in fertility (children ever born) for the entire United States in 1960 and 1970, Pohlmann (unpublished) attributed the greatest importance to age at first marriage. However, the use of a cohort measure would appear to account for much of the explanatory power of this variable. For whites in 1970, female income was clearly second in influence, but for Blacks several variables were of secondary significance, particularly female education and housing adequacy.
Regional studies of mortality are even fewer in number than those of fertility. In England, Melvin-Howe's investigation (1968) of geographic differences in mortality used the excellent data of the British National Health Service. The mortality measure chosen was death rate standardized against the age distribution of the whole British population. The areas

picked were not uniform, but a mixture of geographical units, such as towns, counties, etc. A regional trend toward higher mortality in the northwest of England and Wales was noted. Using the census tracts of Houston for areas, Roberts et al. (1970) correlated the variables of social class, per cent Black, and per cent Spanish surname against mortality for six disease categories and total death rate. Both social class and ethnicity were concluded to be factors influencing mortality levels of various diseases.
The major differences of the present research from the past studies just reviewed are the mode of sample selection (low in-migration areas), the inclusion of both mortality and fertility as dependent variables, the division of mortality indices into various portions of the life span, and the introduction of a density index standardized for land use. The present research determines the relationships of white and nonwhite life expectancy and period fertility to each other and to seventeen population and socioeconomic variables for selected metropolitan areas in 1970. The criteria for choice of SMSA's in the sample was low gross and net in-migration 196070. It was reasoned that in metropolitan areas with higher levels of in-migration, local vital rates do not reflect adequately the area's own social and health conditions, but are altered by a large component in the population of recent in-migrants who are heavily affected in their present vital rates by previous fertility and mortality factors from other regions. These migrants are assumed to take varying periods for assimilation. This past-history determinant has been documented for fertility (Matras, 1973), socioeconomic characteristics in Argentina (Germani, 1966), and in the United States among Blacks (Beale, 1971).
The exact criteria for selection of SMSA's were the following: (1) less than

Vol. 24, No. 1

IS per cent net in-migration 1960-70 for the white and nonwhite populations taken separately; and (2) less than 16.1 per cent gross in-migration 1965-70 for whites and less than 10.6 per cent gross in-migration 1965-70 for Blacks (in both cases, excluding annexation). The following additional criterion was also imposed: (3) The nonwhite population must exceed 13,500. This allows sufficient size to compute fertility and mortality rates for five-year age groups. Thirty-one SMSA's were selected, and all happened to be located in the eastern half of the United States. However, the New Haven and Bridgeport SMSA's did not have proper age-specific birth statistics due to their complicated township composition and were excluded. In Table 1, in-migration levels for the sample are compared with those of 73 other SMSA's not included in the sample.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eighteen dependent and 17 independent variables were chosen. The variables and their values are shown in Table 2. Dependent variables 1-4, 17, and 18 were also included as independent variables in two or more of the regressions. The mode of calculation and justification of choice of these factors are given below. For dependent variables:
Yl Life expectancy from age 0, e(0), for white males in the SMSA.
Y2 e(0) for white females in the SMSA.
Y3 e(0) for nonwhite males in the SMSA.
Y4 e(0) for nonwhite females in the SMSA.
Y5 Infant mortality rate for white males in the SMSA.
Y6 Infant mortality rate for nonwhite males in the SMSA.
Y7 Infant mortality rate for white females in the SMSA.

Y8 Infant mortality rate for nonwhite females in the SMSA.
Y9 Life expectancy from age 1 to age 50, e(l,50), for white males in the SMSA.
Y10 e(l,SO) for nonwhite males in the
SMSA. Yll e(l,50) for white females in the
SMSA. Y12 e(l,50) for nonwhite females in the
SMSA. Y13 Life expectancy from age 50, e(50),
for white males in the SMSA. Y14 e(50) for nonwhite males in the
SMSA. Y15 e(50) for white females in the
SMSA. Y16 e(50) for nonwhite females in the
SMSA. Y17 Gross reproduction rate (GRR) of
the white population. Y18 GRR of the nonwhite population. The above were calculated using standard demographic computer programs (Keyfitz and Flieger, 1971) from five-year population data (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1973), and from five-year fertility data and five- and ten-year mortality statistics (National Center for Health Statistics, 1974). The ten-year data were divided into five-year periods by linear interpolation of the national five-year white and nonwhite, male and female, age distributions in 1970. Life expectancy was considered the best general standardized measure of mortality at a single time point.
Prior studies used as indices of fertility: period measures (crude birth rate, total fertility rate, child-woman ratio), cohort measures (children ever born), and a period index including birth expectation (ratio of actual to expected births). A cohort measure was not chosen because this study intended to look at the immediate effect of 1970 socioeconomic factors on the fertility of the entire age range of women associated with a region.

indices for older women record responses to the metropolitan area at a mixture of past time points. Also, in the past, some of the women were living elsewhere. The GRR was considered superior to other measures because it averages five-year rates for the whole childbearing period.
The independent variables were: X19 Per cent of population nonwhite
(nonwhite population divided by total population). X20 Net migration rate (1960-70). The latter is calculated bythevital rate method of subtraction of natural increase 1960-70 from total increase 1960-70 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1971).

X21 In-migration rate for whites (1965-70).
X22 In-migration rate for nonwhites (1965-70).
The latter was for the non-Negro portion of the population (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1973), which is considered sufficiently close to thewhite segmentdue to the tiny percentage of other nonwhite minorities in the metropolitan areas chosen (see Table 1). The reason forincluding both net and gross in-migration, each fora different time span, isthat these are the only sets of SMSA migration data available for 1960-70, and they measure somewhat different groups of migrants.

X23 Population size (total population of the SMSA in 1970).
X24 Population density index. Many previous studies using land density have calculated density as persons per square mile for the SMSA. It was felt that this ratio is inadequate for some comparisons because of the irregular pattern of land use within these urban areas. One SMSA, such as Nashville, might be mostly or entirely within city limits, whereas another might include large amounts of agricultural land, preserve, governmentowned forest or park, or other undeveloped government lands (e.g., Baltimore, Buffalo, Bakersfield, Evansville). A new density index was constructed which takes the urbanized area as the basic city unit. The urbanized area (population within the city limits plus contiguous incorporated or unincorporated suburban units of 2,500 population or more per mile plus certain contiguous suburban areas of lower density) is a more logical metropolitan unit than population inside city limits, since it includes the suburban population found to be of large magnitude in the 1970 census (Häuser, 1971) and to be highly variable in SMSA's. The density index is defined as follows:
Population of urbanized area plus population of towns and cities of 2,500 population or more outside the urbanized area (within the SMSA) plus the population of the remainder of the SMSA population (= total SMSA population).
X24 = logeLand area of the urbanized area plus land area of towns and cities of 2,500 population or more outside the urbanized area (within the SMSA) plus the "land area"

of the remainder of the SMSA population (calculated at 1 square mile per 1,000 population).
Data for the index are available (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1973). The density estimate of 1,000/square mile for the population outside the urbanized area and outside other towns or cities was obtained by averaging census estimates of land areas of the smallest towns. It is considered that this estimate for rural population offers greater accuracy than averaging arbitrary amounts of nonurbanized land as is done in conventional calculation of SMSA densities.
X25 Medical care index. This index is computed as 3.31 x hospital beds per capita plus nonfederal physicians per capita (American Hospital Association, 1972; Haug et al., 1971). The weighting factor of 3.31 was calculated to equalize the separate variances of the two terms above. These two factors were chosen over others, such as hospital admissions and hospital daily census, because it was felt that the latter partially measure admissions policies and the proportions of inpatient versus outpatient care. An error introduced into this index is the lack of standardization for percentage of persons in the metropolitan area with substandard health, but no comparative data exist for such a standardization. The health care available to nonwhites is less accurately measured by the above index than for whites, because it does not show areas that are particularly strong in minority group physicians, hospitals, and medical training (e.g., Nashville) or areas that are weak.
X26 Welfare (nonwhite). This variable is estimated as average public assistance or public welfare income (for nonwhite families receiving this income) X per cent of the nonwhite fami-

lies receiving this income (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1973). A similar variable is not introduced for the white population, since the average value of the measure for whites is so much lower than that for nonwhite and hence of little demographic importance.
X27 Per cent in the labor force for the white male population 16+ in the SMSA.
X28 Per cent in the labor force for the white female population 16+ in the SMSA.
X29 Per cent in the labor force for the Black male population 16+ in the SMSA.
X30 Per cent in the labor force for the Black female population 16+ in the SMSA.
Data were from the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1973). Labor force includes unemployed workers, but excludes persons in school. Again, the statistical error in substituting Black for nonwhite population is very small.
X31 Per cent Catholic in the SMSA (compiled from archdiocese records, Glenmary Research Center, 1976).
X32 Per cent high-school graduates for
whites, 25+ in the SMSA. X33 Per cent high-school graduates for
Blacks, 25+ in the SMSA. Data for the above were from the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1973). The white population was approximated by subtraction of the Black population from the total.
X34 Income for whites in the SMSA. X35 Income for Blacks in the SMSA. The average income of all families and unrelated individuals for the total and Black population (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1973) was used to estimate average income of whites by subtracting the Black total payroll from the SMSA total payroll and averaging the remainder.

Some error was introduced by miscounting of nonwhites other than Blacks.
RESULTS
Simple correlations appear in Table 3. For calculation of fertility and mortality measures, a computer program was written to sort and interpolate vital statistics into five-year age groups for input into a standard Keyfitz and Flieger LIFE and LOTKA routine. For the independent variables, software was created to convert raw census and other data into the measures employed. All the secondary data were then analyzed using a correlation program designed for this study and the UCLA Biomed step-wise multiple regression program (Dixon, 1973). Age distributions were studied by PYRAMID graphics (Pick, 1974) and a sex-age gap routine.
Before proceeding to the correlations, results of a separate age structure analysis should be mentioned. Age structures for one ethnic group showed little variation among metropolitan regions. Instead, different features occurred consistently between the white and nonwhite structures with the most notable differences as follows: (1) the nonwhite age distribution in each SMSA was more tapered than the white; (2) the depression age gap is present for white distributions, with the exception of Nashville, but is generally flattened or nonexistent (in one-third of the cases) for nonwhite distributions; (3) the sex ratio for age groups 75+ is on the average 29 per cent larger for nonwhites (Table 4).
In an attempt to understand (3), the sex-age gap differences in life expectancies were compared in Table 5. The larger sex-age gap in e(50) for whites would partly account for (3), but only complete historical life expectancy and migration records could fully explain this effect.

RESULTS OF THE REGRESSION ANALYSIS
Table 6 summarizes the results of linear regression analysis. For infant mortality, the only significant multiple correlation was for nonwhite females. White income is the most important contributing factor. Since infant health care comprises a nexus of private and public economic-medical factors, higher white income may tend to lower relative health benefits for the nonwhite infant female. The negative influence of density possibly reflects an environmental health effect.
As expected from the shape of the mortality curve, there are strong similarities between e(0) and e(50). The following analysis for e(0) will apply also to e(50) unless otherwise noted. Total life expectancy of white males is most heavily linked inversely to density and white inmigration. This density effect is not apparent at younger ages (note results for e(l,50)). At older ages, density is the largest factor for whites of both sexes. That such an effect is negative is possibly due to a current medical theory that many health benefits of dense locations are offset by the resultant environmental pollution, congestion, stress, noise, etc. (Hexter and Goldsmith, 1971; Lave and Seskin, 1970; Selikoff et al., 1968). The negative effect of white in-migration may be due to competitive stresses from an increasing labor pool. Similarly, benefits of greater education may ease such competitive factors.
For the older portion of the white male life span, density dominates in importance, displacing white in-migration and education. A possible explanation is that occupational causes of mortality differences, dependent on in-migration and educational level, become less important at older ages due to increasing retirement. Also, perhaps the older white male's un-

usual sensitivity to density is due to his suburban location, where intracity differences in such environmental effects are greater than between central cities.
For the white female, a negative effect of density is again noted, with an explanation similar to that for white males. There is not the increase in density's importance above age SO, probably because of less change in competitive forces at retirement.
For nonwhites, greater similarity in central city environment may reduce the density's importance. Also, perhaps under the same density stress healthy nonwhites are less inclined to leave an SMSA than are healthy whites.
The negative effect on older white female life expectancy of nonwhite income may be due to a series of medicaleconomic factors, where relative economic access to health care may be marginally lowered with increasing nonwhite income. The positive influence of nonwhite education may reflect health benefits of higher educational level in the metropolitan region.
An important variable in accounting for nonwhite male e(0) is white female labor force participation. The cause responsible may be marginal stress increase to the nonwhite male of job competition from the white female. The positive effect of white male labor force participation lacks explanation. Although the positive relation to GRR(W) is not readily understood, the linkage to medical care is obvious. It should be mentioned that for the study in general, medical care appears in only 3 out of 12 life expectancy regressions and is of dominant importance only once. The remaining factors are interpreted similarly to those for white males. Markedly different factors account for e(0) and e(SO) for the nonwhite male, a negative relation with net migration being the most significant for e(SO).

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Regional, ethnic, and sex variations in period fertility, life expectancy, infant mortality, and age structure were examined for 29 SMSA's in the eastern half of the United States in 1970. The SMSA's were chosen on the basis of low inmigration andranged in size from 232,000 to 4,800,000. Theage structures revealed ethnic variation with a more tapered nonwhite distribution and with greater proportionate numbers of nonwhite males at
