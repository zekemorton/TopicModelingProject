ABSTRACT: Differentials in the probability of pregnancy loss are examined using pregnancy history data from eight WFS surveys in developing countries. Multiple logistic regression equations are estimated. The probability of loss varies substantially over the reproductive career. Both higher-order pregnancies and those conceived at older ages are more likely to terminate in loss. Maternal age differentials are more pronounced for lower-order pregnancies. First and second pregnancies conceived over age thirty suffer especially high levels of loss. Pregnancies conceived relatively soon after the termination of the previous pregnancy are more likely to be lost, as are pregnancies conceived after long intervals. Risk of loss is higher for women previously experiencing loss, and the effect persists beyond the pregnancy following the loss.

Fetal loss is a major source of the discrepancy between the amount of unprotected exposure to risk of conception and levels of human fertility (Henry, 1964). Clinical evidence indicates that approximately 60 per cent of fertilized ova in human females do not result in a live birth. Of fertilized ova that implant in the uterus, approximately 35 per cent do not survive long enough to cause a delayed or missed menstrual period, and thus are ordinarily never recognized (Schlesselman, 1979). Of the pregnancies which can be recognized, roughly 20 to 25 per cent result in spontaneous fetal losses, including stillbirths (Leridon, 1977).
In fertility analysis, spontaneous pregnancy loss is conventionally regarded as a given, one of a complex of factors determining the maximum level of fertility (Bongaarts andPotter, 1983). The implicit assumption is that rates of fetal loss are roughly constant across

populations. There is, in fact, no firm evidence verifying this assumption (Leridon, 1977; WHO, 1970), and thus the possibility of significant differentials between populations cannot be rejected out-of-hand. Known relationships between the prevalence of venereal disease and levels of sterility, for example, could be in part the consequence of differences in rates of fetal loss, since infections of the reproductive system are thought to increase the risk of loss (WHO, 1970; see evidence from central Africa in Retel-Laurentin, 1973).
More likely than differences between population groups in levels of fetal loss are inherent differences between women (Leridon, 1977; Naylor, 1974) and differences between pregnancies at different stages of the reproductive career, as indexed by age or gravidity (WHO, 1970). The former may account for some of the unexplained variation between women in reproductive perfor-

mances; but, for the time being, it is difficult to envisage development of practicable means of measuring these unobserved levels of risk. Variation over the course of the reproductive career is more readily examined and is the principal focus of this article.
There is a dispute about the relationship between fetal loss and the principal indices of stage of reproductive career. Previous empirical analyses have, without important exception, found the risk of loss to be greater for pregnancies to older women, and for pregnancies of higher order (Awan, 1975;Kieley et al., 1986; Leridon, 1976; Naylor, 1974; Nortman, 1974;Pebley et al., 1985;Shapiro et al., 1970; Yerushalmy et al., 1956). * These findings do not necessarily imply increasing probability of loss as maternal age and pregnancy order rise. James (1963, 1968, 1974) has pointed out that the observed relationships with maternal age and pregnancy order would appear if pregnancies at advanced ages and higher orders occurred disproportionately to women at higher risk of loss. This finding could occur if loss itself prompted pregnancies at older ages (efforts to achieve target family sizes) and of higher order (shortened pregnancy intervals, due to losses, resulting in a larger number of pregnancies), or if common sets of factors (e.g., socioeconomic status) influenced both the probability of loss and the probability of becoming pregnant at later ages and higher orders. James (1968, 1974) reports analyses which suggest that such artifactual processes are the primary

cause of the observed relationships with age and order, but other empirical research is not consistent with James' argument (Naylor, 1974; Leridon, 1976). Moreover, there is clinical evidence that some of the suspected causes of fetal deaths are positively associated with age and possibly order (James, 1974; Naylor, 1974; WHO, 1970).
All of the pertinent sets of factors are not easily taken into account. Tests for genuine age and order effects clearly must examine probabilities of loss over the reproductive career, i.e., the woman or pregnancy history must be the unit of analysis. Ordinarily, however, pregnancy history data for contemporary populations are collected from crosssections of reproductive-age women, few of whom have completed their childbearing at the time of the interview. Analysis can be restricted to women at the older reproductive ages. But the data for such women often suffer from omissions of events in the more distant past, which itself will result in an impression of positive age and order effects. A further confounding factor in populations where fertility control is exercised is that pregnancy progression may be contingent on pregnancy outcome (Billewicz, 1973). As noted above, this can lead to a selectivity for high risk of those conceiving at older ages and higher orders. Estimated order effects can also be more subtly distorted if there is a tendency to stop childbearing with a successful outcome. Last pregnancies will then show lower loss rates.

1Some of the same studies provide evidence of higher risk of loss before age twenty and for first pregnancies, but these results are not universal, and the estimated effects of young age andfirstorder are typically rather small.

Finally, adding to these complexities is the practical consideration that most pregnancy loss data either do not distinguish spontaneous and induced losses, or, where they are recorded separately, a significant proportion of induced

neous and induced loss, as the conventional wisdom was that coverage of these events is inevitably seriously incomplete in retrospective maternity history data. Assessment of the coverage in WFS surveys confirms a significant level of omission. The highest rates of spontaneous loss obtained from nonclinical studies range from 20 to 24 per 100pregnancies after the fourth gestational week (Erhardt, 1963; French and Bierman, 1962; Shapiro et al., 1970). These estimates are obtained by life table methodologies which account for variation in the timing (with respect to gestational duration) of entrance to observation. Crude rates of loss--total losses divided by total observed pregnancies-- from the same studies range from 10 to 15 per 100 pregnancies, and these are the proper standard for assessing retrospective pregnancy history estimates. By this standard, we conclude that 50 to 80 per cent of fetal losses have been detected in WFS surveys (Casterline, 1989).
For this analysis we select eight countries where the coverage appears relatively complete: Ivory Coast, Tunisia, Syria, Korea, the Philippines, Costa Rica, Mexico, and Guyana. (For details about the design of the eight surveys and the basicfindings,see Central Bureau of Statistics, 1982; Direccion General de Estadistica, 1979; Direccion General de Estadistica y Censos, 1978; National Bureau of Statistics, 1977; National Census and Statistics Office, 1979; Office Nacional du Planing Familial et de la Population, 1982; Statistical Bureau, 1980.) The countries are purposely chosen not only on the basis of the reported level of loss, but also to provide a diversity of societal and demographic settings. In terms of the prevalence of volitional fertility control, at

one end of the spectrum are the Ivory Coast and Syria, which appear to be largely natural fertility populations; at the other end fall Korea and Costa Rica, which show the most controlled fertility regimes among the 41 developing countries surveyed in the WFS.
In each of the countries, women of reproductive age were asked to provide the date of termination of all pregnancies. (In Syria, Korea, and the Philippines, only ever-married women were interviewed; elsewhere, women of all marital statuses were interviewed.) The format of the maternity history varied among the eight countries (Singh, 1984). Elsewhere we conclude that the format per se did not substantially affect the coverage of pregnancy losses (Casterline, 1988). Under every format, respondents were asked for the calendar month and year of all pregnancy terminations. Failing to obtain the calendar date, the interviewer was instructed to ascertain the number of years since the termination and, as a last resort, the birth interval for pregnancy losses.2
Early fetal losses (miscarriages, induced abortions) and late fetal losses (stillbirths) are distinguished in all eight countries. We treat miscarriages and stillbirths together as "spontaneous" losses. Stillbirths comprise one-quarter or less of all losses in each country. In two of the countries--Syria and Guyana--miscarriages and induced losses were not reported separately. The levels and differentials in these two countries strongly suggest the presence of a substantial proportion of induced losses (Casterline, 1988). We include
2In the WFS Standard Recode files we utilize, missing calendar dates have been imputed by a random procedure. It is likely that imputation was required more often for losses than live births (Casterline, 1988).

the two countries in this analysis as illustration of the impact on the estimates of an almost certain mixing of spontaneous and induced losses.
Analysis of pregnancy loss requires some departures from the conventions of analysis of fertility survey data. First, to place pregnancy losses and live births on an equal footing, we date in terms of month of conception (assuming a fixed nine-month gestation period for all live births) and count multiple births as one pregnancy. Second, to avoid truncation bias, pregnancies conceived in the nine months preceding the survey date are excluded from consideration. The sample consists of conceptions in the period 10 through 128 months preceding the survey date. Estimates of rates of lossby historical period suggest relatively less omission of losses during this reference period (Casterline, 1988).
In countries where spontaneous and induced losses are distinguished (Syria and Guyana are the exception), pregnancy outcome is a three-category variable: live birth, spontaneous loss, induced loss. Multiple regression analysis is considerably simplified when the dependent variable is a dichotomy. In the Ivory Coast, the Philippines, Costa Rica, and Mexico, reported induced losses comprise 1 per cent or less of pregnancies and thus are of little concern. However, in countries where induced losses constitute a higher proportion of all outcomes (Tunisia, 3.5 per cent of losses; and Korea, 25.4 per cent of losses) their treatment in the analysis of spontaneous loss will affect the results. As there is some evidence that reported induced losses occur on average at earlier gestational durations than do spontaneous losses (Casterline, 1988), we exclude induced losses from the sample. This is far from an optimal

solution to the analytic problems introduced by the multiple loss outcomes.
We fit multiple logistic regression equations, with pregnancy outcome as the response. Omitting subscripts, the statistical model is
LnE(P/(l-P)) = Xb
where Ln denotes the natural logarithm transformation, E is the mathematical expectation operator, P is the probability of pregnancy loss, Xis a vector of explanatory variables, and b is the vector of parameters to be estimated. The data are assumed to be binomially distributed. The statistical significance of particular terms is judged through a chisquare test on the difference in goodness-of-fit between equations including and excluding the term in question. All of the explanatory variables are entered into the equations as categorical variables. To identity the equations, the parameter for the first category of each variable is omitted. The coefficients for the other categories thus represent differences (in Ln (P/l-P)) (i.e., in the "logit of fetal death") between the category in question and the omitted category.
RESULTS
We first examine unadjusted levelsof spontaneous loss by categories of maternal age, pregnancy order, pregnancy interval, maternal schooling, and type of place of residence (Table 1). The percentage distributions of all pregnancies according to these variables are presented in Table 2. The overall level of loss ranges from 7.1 per cent in Korea to 17.4 per cent in Guyana. The relatively low level in Korea is probably explained by the high level of induced abortion (20.6 per cent of all pregnancies con-

ceived in this period, according to respondents' reports), as induced abortions are selective of those pregnancies more likely to be aborted spontaneously (higher order, older maternal age). The relatively high level of overall loss in Guyana is probably the consequence of the presence of induced losses, which are not distinguished from spontaneous losses in the data from this country.
The differentials by demographic characteristics are in conformity with previous research. The risk of loss rises with age and pregnancy order. Pregnancies conceived before age twenty are at slightly greater risk in the Ivory Coast, Tunisia, and Korea; first pregnancies are at slightly greater risk in the Ivory Coast, Kenya, Tunisia, Korea, the Philippines, and Costa Rica. But the additional rates of loss for these pregnancies is minimal relative to the increased rates at older ages and higher orders. The unadjusted percentage by length of interval since the previous pregnancy show a U-shaped pattern, with pregnancies conceived 16 to 35 months after termination of the previous pregnancy least likely to end in a fetal death. In the Philippines and Guyana, the risk of loss for pregnancies conceived after 35 months is roughly the same as the risk for those conceived after an interval of nine months or less, indicative that the causes of higher loss following longer intervals must be rather powerful. In several countries--Tunisia, Costa Rica, Mexico--long intervals are associated with little additional risk of loss.3
3Note in Table 2 that long intervals are slightly more common in these three countries. We are reluctant to place much weight on subtle differences between countries in the patterns by pregnancy interval, since the proportion of termination dates imputed also varies between countries (Casterline, 1988).

The differentials by maternal education are rather small in the Ivory Coast, Tunisia, the Philippines, and Costa Rica. In Syria, Korea, and Mexico, better-educated women report a higher percentage lost, whereas in Guyana an inverse pattern emerges. The majority of the Guyanese sample, however, falls into the highest educational category. Excepting Syria, Korea, and Mexico, then, there is no evidence of markedly better reporting, or of higher proportions of disguised induced losses, among the better educated. Differentials by type of place of residence are somewhat sharper and more uniform, with rural women in all eight countries reporting the lowest rates of loss. As completeness of reporting would seem more likely to be associated with maternal education than place of residence, we interpret the latter differentials as reflective of a higher incidence of induced loss (reported as spontaneous) in urban areas, where abortion services are likely to be more available.
ADDITIVE MODELS
We combine all five of the explanatory variables in Table 1 in an additive equation. Statistical tests of the significance of each variable are summarized in Table 3. Maternal schooling emerges as the weakest predictor of the five, showing significant effects only in Syria, Korea, the Philippines, and Mexico. All other variables test as significant, with the exception of pregnancy order in the Ivory Coast and residence in Korea. The results demonstrate that it is reasonable to speak of independent effects of factors such as maternal age and pregnancy order.
In order to consider the nature of the net effects of each variable, we turn to

The patterns of adjusted effects for intervals since the previous pregnancy largely resemble the unadjusted percentages, so we do not discuss these further. The same comment applies to the differentials by maternal schooling and place of residence. We note again that the educational differentials test is statistically significant in four of the eight countries, whereas place of residence is significant everywhere except Korea, further indication of the stronger association of pregnancy loss with residence than with education of the mother.
We noted earlier that age and order differentials need not imply increasing risk of loss as maternal age and pregnancy order increase. The potential sources of spurious patterns are complex and not easily controlled. However, several types of simpler tables provide a more demanding test of the existence of the relationships apparent in Tables 3 and 4. In Table 6, we consider the differentials by maternal age, restricting attention to specific pregnancy orders. This serves as a control for the possibility that experience at older ages is distorted by the continued childbearing of women more likely to experience loss. The maternal age patterns evident here largely resemble those in Table 4, except where small sample sizes lead to unstable results. The incidence of loss of pregnancies conceived over age 40 is 1.5 to 2 times greater than the loss at ages 30-34 in Korea, the Philippines, Mexico, and Guyana. In other countries the positive age effect is less sharp, but nevertheless distinct, with the

exception of the Ivory Coast. Somewhat higher rates of loss below age thirty in most countries are probably the consequence of the short pregnancy spacing implicit in this age-order interaction.
We pursue both maternal age and, in particular, pregnancy order effects in Table 7. A tendency for higher-order pregnancies and pregnancies at older maternal ages to be contributed disproportionately by women more likely to experience loss is a plausible explanation of the estimated order and age effects (James, 1974). A more severe test is provided by examination of differentials by order within pregnancy histories. This can be approximated by considering probabilities of loss by order for women whose reproduction is largely complete, namely women age 40-44 at the survey, classified according to their gravidity at the survey. Because age is not controlled here, age effects will be expressed in the order effects. Thus, this analysis examines more generally the pattern of loss over reproductive careers. It is clear from Table 7 that the risk of loss rises with pregnancy order among women of the same (completed) gravidity (first two panels). Indeed, comparisons with the overall pattern of loss (i.e., without stratification by gravidity) shown in the final panel indicate that the overall pattern is fairly well reproduced in the histories of women of specific gravidity.6 Consistent with the earlier analysis,firstpregnancies tend to show a higher risk of fetal death. The effect is not uniformly apparent and is rather small in magnitude in most instances. Note that memory loss effects operate against reported higher loss of

maternal age explains the higher loss of first pregnancies in the Punjab. The first pregnancy effects considered here are adjusted for maternal effects, which in any case appear to be minor before age thirty.

6The flat order-pattern in the Ivory Coast remains an anomaly.

first pregnancies and in favor of a monotonic rise in rates of loss with order.
With respect to the patterns of lossby length of the preceding pregnancy interval, we asked two further questions. First, to what extent is the length of pregnancy interval a feature of women or of births? If pregnancy intervals vary little over a woman's reproductive career, then perhaps pregnancy interval effects proxy for other characteristics of women which are the cause of higher incidence of loss. On the other hand, substantial within-woman variability in pregnancy intervals strengthens the case for assigning responsibility to effects of interval length per se. We have again analyzed careers of women advanced in their reproductive career as of the survey date (women aged 35-39 and 4044). A simple decomposition of variation in pregnancy intervals (defined as months between termination and conception) reveals that 75per cent or more of the total variation occurs among intervals within careers of particular women. Further multivariate analysis suggests that the absolute length of the previous pregnancy interval is a stronger correlate of the probability of loss than the mean interval length or the deviation of the previous interval from the mean. The data strongly suggest that the crucial variable is the absolute length of the interval, which itself tends to vary over a woman's career.
A second question is whether the previous interval effect applies equally well when the previous pregnancy survives through the gestation of the pregnancy in question and when the previouspregnancy dies before conception. If the mechanism of the effect is depletion of maternal resources, one might expect less strain on the mother when the previous pregnancy does not survive

to conception. But recovery of certain maternal resources may require fixed periods of time regardless of fetal and infant survival. The survival status of the previous pregnancy is also an element in an artifactual explanation of the interval effect, which goes as follows. The probability of loss is greatly elevated following a loss (Leridon, 1976;see also analysis below). Moreover, the interval to the next conception will on average be shorter following a loss, due to a briefer anovulatory period (especially in populations practicing extended breastfeeding). These two factors together contribute to an observed negative association between interval length and the risk of loss.
To consider this possibility, we reestimated the equations of Table 4 separately for pregnancies classified by the survival status of the previous pregnancy (Table 8). Included among pregnancies not surviving to the next conception are fetal losses. Comparison of the coefficients of Panel A with the corresponding coefficients in Table 4 reveals no consistent differences. The estimated interval effect is essentially unaffected by the elimination of pregnancies preceded by a fetal loss or infant death. Thus, we reject the artifactual explanation proposed above. Unfortunately, sample size does not permit sound comparison of Panels A and B, which would indicate whether survival of a previous live birth through the pregnancy accentuates the interval effect, as a consequence of the physical strain of breastfeeding, for example (see evidence in Swenson and Harper, 1978).

fects of the five explanatory variables. There are reasons to suspect that this formulation is inappropriate. For example, there is some suggestion in previous work that maternal age and pregnancy order interact. First pregnancies at older ages, and higher order pregnancies at younger ages, appear especially disadvantaged (Naylor, 1974; Nortman, 1974). Unusually high risks for higher order pregnancies at younger ages are, plausibly, the consequence of pregnancy spacing effects, but interactions between first pregnancy and age might well be genuine, reflecting physiological difficulties in commencing reproduction at advanced ages. Similarly, one might posit interactions between the demographic variables and the socioeconomic characteristics of the mother. To the extent that medical care can alleviate the risks of loss, the demographic differentials might be attenuated for bettereducated and urban women, who are more likely to make use of modern medical services. On the other hand, induced abortion is probably more common in these strata, and the reporting of these as spontaneous losses would tend to accentuate effects of demographic characteristics.

The results of the statistical tests are summarized in Table 9. Since a certain fraction of effects will test as significant due to chance alone, depending on the significance level used as a criterion, we consider only those interactions emerging as significant at the 0.10 level in three or more countries. Thus, we conclude that maternal schooling and residence do not interact in affecting the probability of loss, nor does schooling interact with maternal age or pregnancy order. An interaction between schooling and the length of the pregnancy interval is apparent, however, as is a corresponding interaction between type of place of residence and the pregnancy interval. We have examined the parameter estimates for this interaction, in those countries where it is significant. An impressively uniform picture emerges. In all cases, the interval effects are sharper for less-educated and rural women. Bettereducated and urban women, in contrast, show relatively weak associations between pregnancy spacing and the risk of fetal loss. The mechanism underlying this interaction is not clear; perhaps the shorter breastfeeding durations of educated and urban women (Ferry and Smith, 1983) is a partial explanation.

In order to test for interactions, we add terms representing two-way interactions to the additive equation estimated earlier. The ten two-way interactions are tested singly, i.e., ten estimations per country. We collapse across categories of each variable, to avoid small cell sizes in the two-way interactions.7
7The recoded variables are asfollows: maternal age, < 20,20-29, 30 + ;pregnancy order 1-2, 3-6, 7+; pregnancy interval, < 9, 9-23, 24+ , first pregnancy; maternal schooling, low, mid-high (excepting Korea, Philippines, and Guyana: low-mid, high); residence, rural urban.

In contrast to maternal schooling, residence interacts with maternal age and pregnancy order. We have also examined these interactions in detail. The results are not as uniform as those discussed above. In general, in the countries where these interactions are significant, they consist of sharper age and order effects for urban women. The opposite holds in Guyana, however, where the age and order effects are more pronounced for rural women. We speculate that the sharper effects for urban women in Syria, Korea, the Philippines, and Mexico reflect the inclusion of in-

duced losses among the pregnancies analyzed. Induced abortions are likely to be more common in urban areas and among women at older ages and higher gravidities.
Table 9 indicates that the effects of pregnancy interval are additive with those of maternal age and pregnancy order.
Finally, we consider the interaction between maternal age and pregnancy order, which is of particular interest because of implications about preferable timings of childbearing during the reproductive years. The results do indicate that significant interactions exist. We have pursued this interaction further, exploring a variety of parameterizations in an effort to capture the interaction with the most parsimonious specification. (Moreover, the rarity of some combinations, such as higherorder pregnancies conceived before age 20, argues for collapsing the full interaction.) The full interaction may be sketched as shown in Table 10. Cell 1is the omitted category under the parameterization we adopt. When the full interaction is fit, Cells 2 and 3 and Cells 4 and 7 are represented by the additive order and age terms, respectively, and Cells 5, 6,8, and 9 are represented by the terms comprising the interaction.

simpler equation, in which the interaction is represented by two additional parameters, captures the interaction and yields more sensible patterns of effects. The equation includes a term representing pregnancies of order three through six conceived at ages 30 + (Cell 8), and a term representing pregnancies at order seven and above conceived at ages 30 + (Cell 9). That is, terms representing these same two sets of pregnancy orders at ages 20-29 are superfluous, probably because of the lack of pregnancies at the same orders under age 20, which serve as a reference in the full interaction.
The patterns of effects derived from estimating this equation are presented in Table 11.The most salient feature of the interaction is the elevated risk of loss for first or second pregnancies conceived above age thirty. This conclusion is based not on the absolute values shown in Table 11,but rather on the age differentials within each order. It is in this respect that first pregnancies at older ages are especially disadvantaged. The difference in the probability of loss between pregnancies conceived before and after age thirty is substantially greater for first pregnancies than higherorder pregnancies in most of the countries (note the Ivory Coast, Tunisia, the Philippines, Guyana, Costa Rica, Mexico). This same interaction is observed by Kiely et al., (1986), Naylor (1974), and Nortman (1974).
A second feature of the patterns of effects in Table 11 is a heightened risk for higher order pregnancies conceived under age thirty. In contrast, at ages over thirty, differentials by order are small or absent. We interpret this result as reflecting effects of pregnancy spacing beyond the impact of length of the preceding pregnancy interval, which is controlled. That is, there appear to be

cumulative spacing effects in addition to the immediate impact of the time elapsed between the previous pregnancy termination and the conception of the pregnancy in question.
PREGNANCY LOSS HISTORIES
Pregnancy history data permit analysis of the occurrence of pregnancy losses in the context of a pregnancy history. The effects of pregnancy spacing evident in Tables 1,3,4, and 8 demonstrate the insight afforded by treating pregnancies as a sequence of events over a woman's reproductive career rather than as independent occurrences. Whereas the analysis in previous sections was restricted to pregnancies conceived in the ten years preceding the survey, here we examine the entire pregnancy history up to the survey date.
We first consider the frequency of occurrence of losses over the pregnancy history, using birth intervals as the unit of observation. From Panel A of Table 12, it is evident that reported spontaneous pregnancy loss is a rare event. Only in Guyana (where we suspect appreciable numbers of induced losses) do 10per cent or more of intervals contain a reported loss, and in the other countries the figure is 7 per cent or less. This is a lower percentage than the overall percentage of pregnancies terminating in spontaneous loss, because of the higher probability of a loss following a loss than a live birth (a fact we consider below). Indeed, as the figures in Panel B of Table 12 document, more than 10 per cent of pregnancy losses were not isolated occurrences, but rather occurred in intervals in which one or more other losses occurred. In some age groups in some countries, as many as 20 per cent or more of losses occurred along with one

or more others. Guyana shows this tendency to the greatest extent.
Implicit in the comparison of Panels A and B is the fact that the risk of loss is higher following a loss. We now turn to this matter, which has received considerable attention in other studies (Leridon, 1976; Naylor, 1974; Pantelakis et al., 1973; Potter et al., 1975; Shapiro et al., 1970; Yerushalmy et al., 1956). Our findings reinforce the previous work. In Table 13, we show the spontaneous loss rates for sequences of three pregnancies (all such sequences among pregnancies one through fifteen, aggregated together). When the previous pregnancy terminates in loss, the next pregnancy is approximately three times as likely to terminate in spontaneous loss in five countries, the exceptions being the Philippines, Costa Rica, and Mexico. (The risk is approximately four times greater in Tunisia and Korea.) This conclusion also applies to third pregnancies following a loss as compared to a live birth in a sequence of which the first is a live birth. When the first of a sequence of three is lost, however, the probability of loss is elevated for third pregnancies, compared to first pregnancies, whether the second is a live birth or a loss (a finding in agreement with Leridon, 1976). In seven of the eight countries (except Mexico) the relative risk of loss following a loss is reduced in this circumstance. Finally, considering the two extreme sequences, we note that the probability of loss following two live births is somewhat lower than the overall probability of loss (as represented by "first pregnancy") , but little less generally than the probability of loss of a second pregnancy following a live birth. The probability of pregnancy loss following two losses, on the contrary, is substantially greater than the probability of loss following

only one loss and approaches or exceeds 40 per 100 pregnancies in all countries except the Philippines.
There are several explanations for the increased risk of loss following a loss (Potter et al., 1975). Two spurious relationships are candidates: selection of women for completeness of reporting of losses; or inclusion of induced abortions as spontaneous losses, taking account of the tendency for induced abortions to repeat (Tietze and Jain, 1978). A genuine tendency for the risk of loss to be elevated following a loss can be a reflection of heterogeneity among women in risk, due to whatever genetic or behavioral factors. In the data of Pantelakis et al., (1973), the incidence of premature births increases following a spontaneous or induced loss, which suggests anatomical defects as a contributory factor. Behaviorial factors, such as a tendency towards short pregnancy intervals, could also easily play some role. The heterogeneity could consist of a subgroup of women characterized by uniformly higher risks, but a gradation of risk seems more likely, perhaps following a beta or negative binomial distribution (Leridon 1977; Naylor, 1974).

at ages thirty and above suffer higher levels of loss than expected on the basis of the overall maternal age and pregnancy order effects.
The probability of loss is associated with two features of the mother's previous pregnancy history: the interval elapsed since the termination of the most recent pregnancy, and the occurrence of previous fetal deaths. Pregnancies conceived relatively soon after the previous pregnancy are more likely to be lost, as are pregnancies conceived after long intervals. This U-shaped relationship conforms with previous work and can be understood as the consequence of several behavioral and biological factors. The relationship is weaker for better-educated and urban women, for unknown reasons. The data also suggest that there are effects of a succession of relatively closely spaced pregnancies in addition to the effect of the length of the interval immediately preceding a pregnancy. The increased risk for women previously suffering loss is well recognized. This analysis indicates that the increased risk applies beyond the pregnancy following a loss, but the effects are sharpest for this pregnancy.
