ABSTRACT: Using data from the 1993 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, this study explores the relationship between ethnicity and sexual behavior: having sex before age 17 and premarital sexual experience. All ethnic groups show substantial sexual experience before age 17 and premarital sexual engagement. Logistic regression analyses reveal that in general ethnicity influences the behaviors studied, especially for ever-married women. The data suggest that groups that practice matrilineal and patrilineal systems show differences in the likelihood of having sex before age 17. Contrary to expectation, there is an inverse relationship between education and sexual experience before age 17. The findings highlight the importance of groupspecific programs in Africa.

The greatest health challenge facing African countries is how to contain the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). According to a United Nations country-by-country analysis of the disease in 1997, thirty million people world-wide were infected with HIV, of which twenty-one million were in Africa. There is increasing awareness that most HIV infections in Africa are transmitted through heterosexual intercourse (WHO, 1994; Goncalves, 1994; Obbo, 1993; Padian et al., 1991).
In Africa an increasing number of younger unmarried adolescents are having premarital sex and multiple sexual partners (Buga et al., 1996; Lagarde et al., 1996; Renne, 1993; Pillai and Yates, 1993; Anarfi, 1991; Orubuloye et al., 1991). The consequences of these sexual activities are high incidence of pregnancies, births, and abortions among young unmarried women (Ajayi et al., 1991; Castle et al., 1990; United Nations, 1989). Also accompanying these shifts in

adolescent sexual activities and fertility has been sharp increase in the incidence of HIV infection in Africa (WHO, 1994). Longitudinal studies suggest that HIV prevalence among women of childbearing age increased at a near-exponential rate during the 1980's, with a doubling time of one to three years in some urban areas (Gregson et al., 1994). Given the high prevalence of HIV infection through heterosexual intercourse, it is important to understand the factors shaping sexual onset.
Ethnographic and other literature show that sexual behavior customs vary from prohibition to permissiveness across cultural groups in Africa (Murdock, 1967, 1964; Westbrook, 1963). Epidemiological studies have identified sexual promiscuity as the most important cultural factor contributing to HIV transmission in Africa (Caldwell et al., 1989; Johnson and Laga, 1988; Clumeck, 1988; Mann et al., 1988; Hrdy, 1987). In addition, certain cultural practices may elevate the likelihood of HIV infection among young women in

Africa (Meekers and Calves, 1997; Network, 1997; Weiss et al., 1996; EsuWilliam, 1994). For instance, the practice of marrying daughters at earlier ages, often to older polygamous men, prevalent among various ethnic groups, particularly in west Africa, increases the likelihood of infection (Network, 1997).
Studies have also documented that each cultural group in Africa had unique norms and practices that regulated sexual activities with relevant sanctions when mores were breached (Feyisetan and Pebley, 1989; Richards, 1982; Sarpong, 1977; Kabwegyere, 1977; Weekes-Vagliani, 1977; Fortes, 1954; Kenyatta, 1938; Leaky, 1931). Despite the repeated reference in AIDS literature to cultural practices and norms such as non-monogamous relations (Caldwell et al., 1989; Anonymous, 1988; O'Reilly, 1986), there are few studies, if any, which have systematically assessed whether cultural background per se is an important predictor of sexual behavior in Africa. The extent to which specific cultural background predicts sexual behavior is almost an unknown. This study is a modest attempt to fill this gap by exploring the relative importance of subgroup norms, values, practices, and customs in predicting sexual behavior among Ghanaian women.
THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Most studies on sexual activity in Africa have used one of three approaches to explain female sexual behavior. The first, the "subcultural hypothesis," holds that female sexual behavior is shaped by subgroup expectations, customs, and norms (Mutambirwa, 1990; Schlegel and Barry, 1986; Broude, 1981; Goethals, 1978; Goody, 1976, 1973, 1971, 1969;

Eckhardt, 1971; Murdock, 1967, 1964; Coleman, 1966). This explanation maintains that group variations in sexual behavior are primarily due to cultural norms and practices specific to particular groups. Based on anthropological studies three main theses can be subsumed under the subcultural hypothesis.
The first thesis associates female sexual behavior to her social role in a particular group or society (Schlegel and Barry, 1986). According to Schlegel and Barry, there is an association between the female social role and sexual permissiveness. The basic proposition of this explanation is that societies with high female contribution to subsistence are likely to allow a higher level of sexual permissiveness. Therefore, high level of sexual permissiveness will characterize groups with high female contribution to subsistence.
Assuming that in Africa women's contribution to subsistence is higher in rural areas than in urban settings, then the expectation is that women born and raised in rural areas should demonstrate'a higher level of sexual permissiveness, such as early sexual intercourse and premarital sexual experience, than their urban counterparts. Studies from Africa do not support this proposition (Meekers, 1994; Orubuloye et al., 1991; Anarfi, 1991). For instance, in Ekiti, Nigeria, Orubuloye et al. (1991) reported a higher level of premarital and extramarital sexual activity among urban residents than their rural counterparts.
Another variant of the subcultural hypothesis is "the diverging devolution thesis" (Goody, 1969). At the center of this explanation is the relationship between property ownership, the lineage, and sexuality. The basic premise of this thesis is that if property belongs to lineage rather

than to individuals or nuclear families, then there will be less need to control women's sexuality. According to the logic of this explanation, groups in which property belongs to lineage should display a high incidence of premarital sexual activities and out-of-wedlock birth (Lesthaeghe, 1986). In the context of the diverging devolution perspective, Goody (1969) has suggested that female sexual behavior in Africa is shaped strongly by poor farming techniques that do not generate surplus and wealth and by the lack of diverging inheritance.
The third variant of the subcultural hypothesis is the "patrilineal bias thesis" (Goethals, 1978; Eckhardt, 1971; Coleman, 1966; Murdock, 1964). This explanation associates type of kinship system with sexual behavior among women. The basic supposition is that where males are in a position of power and authority, that is, where the kinship system is patriarchal, sanctions against female nonmarital sexual behavior tend to be more severe than where females have authority, as in a matriarchal situation (Goethals, 1978). Murdock's (1964) study of 180 societies around the world found that patrilineal societies are more restrictive about female sexual freedom than matrilineal societies. Based on this patrilineal bias thesis, the incidence of early sexual initiation and premarital sexual experience should be higher among matrilineal groups.
The second hypothesis is termed the "rational adaptation hypothesis" (Philipson and Posner, 1995; Barker and Rich, 1992; Schoepf, 1988). This hypothesis links the level of female sexual activity to gender inequality in the distribution of resources in a particular society. It argues that keeping women poor gives prosperous men ready access to multiple sexual

partners because it keeps the "price" of women's sexual services low.
Proponents of the rational adaptation hypothesis explain the current sexual behavior of women, especially the unmarried in Africa, in terms of economic benefits (Barker and Rich, 1992; Schoepf, 1988). For example, in their study of adolescent sexuality in Nigeria, Barker and Rich (1992) have reported that poverty was partly the cause of sexual intercourse, particularly among students.
"Social disorganization" is the third hypothesis. This perspective is grounded in the social control theory (Hirschi, 1969). It relates female sexual activity to change in traditional social control. This hypothesis attributes the current level of female sexual activity to a breakdown of the social control that older persons had over younger ones (Enel and Pison, 1990; Bauni, 1990; Ocholla-Ayayo et al., 1990; Cherlin and Riley, 1986). A study by Ocholla-Ayayo et al. (1990, p. 67) in Kenya reported that 60 per cent of the respondents did not believe that traditional norms restricting premarital and extramarital sexual relations were applicable in contemporary society. In other African societies, studies have shown that premarital virginity is no longer considered important, particularly in urban settings (see Orubuloye et al., 1991;Anarfi, 1991; Ochalla-Ayayo et al., 1990).
The social disorganization hypothesis suggests that education, urbanization, and Western media work to erode the basis of the traditional social control of female sexual activities in sub-Saharan Africa. These forces of modernization, according to the social disorganization theory, have armed youth with knowledge with which to challenge the wisdom of the traditional control of sexual behavior.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study uses data from the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS) conducted in 1993. The GDHS is a nationally representative, stratified, selfweighting, probability sample of women aged 15-49. Households were identified using a three-stage cluster sampling procedure based on census enumeration areas (ecological zones as well as rural and urban localities). One hundred and fifty census enumeration areas were selected for the survey, with probability proportional to the number of 1984 census households. Ninety-eight per cent of all eligible women (women within the stated age range of the study who spent the previous night in the selected household) were successfully interviewed, resulting in a final sample of 4,562 women (Ghana Statistical Services, 1993).
The data on age at first intercourse in a developing country like Ghana deserve some comment (Weiss et al., 1996). Given the sensitive nature of sexual behavior, it may be reasonable for people to be skeptical about the quality of data gathered on sexual behavior. It is noteworthy that Blanc and Rutenberg (1990, 1991) have reported that response rates on questions on first sexual intercourse were very good in the GDHS questionnaire.
Blanc and Rutenberg (1990) documented that if age at first intercourse was greater than age at first marriage by more than one year, then the age at first intercourse was decreased by one year to make the two dates consistent. Such an adjustment is a common procedure to correct the order of events (Kahn et al., 1988). In order to reduce the extent of mismatch between age at first intercourse and age at first marriage, a code indicat-

ing that the respondent initiated sexual intercourse at the time of her union was added to the question on age at first intercourse in the 1993 GDHS based on the Phase II model questionnaire.
ANALYSIS
Dependent variables.--Two measures of sexual behavior, having sex before age 17 (as an indicator of early sexual onset) and premarital sexual experience (proxy for multiple sexual partners), are used in this study. Based on measures of sexual behavior, the dependent variables used in this paper are: (1) sexual intercourse before age 17 (coded: sexual intercourse at exact age 16 and younger = 1; sexual intercourse at any age = 0); (2) premarital sexual experience (coded: sexual experience before marriage = 1; sexual intercourse at time of marriage = 0). The analysis is carried out for nevermarried and ever-married women separately.
These measures of sexual behavior have been selected for two reasons. First, the physiology of the developing cervix is likely to increase the vulnerability of young women (age 16 and younger) to sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV (NAS, 1996). Second, studies in Africa have found that most women have their premarital sexual experience with men other than their husbands (Djamba, 1995; Anarfi, 1991; Orubuloye et al., 1991). Although what proportion of the increase in susceptibility to STD's observed among teens is behavioral, social, or biological in nature is unclear, what is certain in the literature is the association between increased infection of STD's, including HIV, with early sexual onset and multiple partners (McCauley and Salter, 1995; Strobino, 1987).

Independent variables.--This study cannot directly assess the impact of subgroup norms and practices on sexual behavior because such information is not available in the data set. Ethnic heritage is used as a proxy for cultural norms and practices. Ethnic heritage refers to the broad categories of ethnic groupings respondents identified during the survey. Seven cultural groups are used in this study: Twi, Fante, Other Akans, GaAdangbe, Ewe, Guans/Others, and MoleDagbani.
The Twi (Ashanti and Akwapim), Fante, and Other Akans are Akan people with a matrilineal kinship system. The Ga-Adangbe, the Ewe-speaking people, the Guans/Others, and the Mole-Dagbani are patrilineal. The likelihood of engaging in sexual behavior for Fante, Other Akans, Ga-Adangbe, Ewe, Guans/Others, and Mole-Dagbani women is contrasted with that of their Twi counterparts.
Control variables.--Control variables have been selected because of their theoretical importance and availability in our data set (Djamba, 1997; Meekers, 1994; Brewster et al., 1993). Some variables such as parents' education and income are not included in the analysis because such predictors are not available. In the present study, the following variables are used as controls: (a) respondent's education categorized into (1) no education, (2) primary/Jss, (3) secondary/higher; (b) childhood place of residence, (1) urban, (2) rural; (c) age cohort, (1) 15-24, (2) 25-34, (3) 35-49; and (d) age at marriage (continuous variable, for ever-married women).
Statistical Procedure.--The dichotomous nature of the dependent variables suggests that logistic multiple regression is the most appropriate technique for

analysis (DeMaris, 1995). Regression coefficients, level of significance based on the Wald statistic, and associated odds ratios for all the variables are presented for each contrast of the independent and control variables. The logistic regression equation takes the form:
where qi is the estimated probability of a particular event occurring to an individual with a given set of characteristics, Xt; b0 is a constant that defines the probability; and bp are the estimated coefficients.
The ratio (qjl--q?) is the ratio of women with the given set of characteristics engaging in sexual behavior versus not engaging. The estimate of i»(. for a particular covariate X( is interpreted as the difference in the predicted log odds between those who fall within that category of characteristics and those who fall within the reference or omitted category for that characteristic. If each estimated bj is exponentiated, (exp[&(]), the result can be interpreted as giving the relative odds of engaging in sexual behavior for those individuals with characteristics Xt relative to those individuals in the reference group.
RESULTS
BACKGROUND CHARACTERISTICS
Table 1 reports predictors of sexual behavior by ethnic background. The data indicate that the distribution of respondents aged 15-24 (young cohort) ranges from 28.2 per cent among Mole-Dagbani to 40 per cent among Fante women. About 36 per cent and 35 per cent of Other Akans and Guans/Others women respectively are found in the 15-24 age

group. Over 30 per cent of all the ethnic groups are in the middle age cohort (25-34). Whereas 27 per cent of Twi women are aged 35-49, corresponding figures for Mole-Dagbani, Ewe, and Other Akans women are 34.9 per cent, 30.5 per cent, and 28.9 per cent respectively. Twenty-nine per cent of Ga-Adangbe women are aged 3 5 ^ 9 , and the figure for Guans/Others is 26.4 per cent.
In general, Ga-Adangbe women are the most educated. Fante and Twi women of whom almost 12 per cent have attained secondary/higher education follow them. The Mole-Dagbani women are the least educated with 76 per cent reporting no education and only 3.7 per cent having secondary/higher education. The percentage of Guans/Other women who reported no education is about 63 per cent, with 6.6 per cent having secondary/ higher education.

Over 50 per cent of Twi, Fante, GaAdangbe, and Ewe women were raised in rural areas. The majority of Guans/Others and Mole-Dagbani women were raised in rural settings. The average age at marriage among the ethnic groups does not vary much from 18.18 among Guans/ Others to 18.88 among Ga-Adangbe women.
SEXUAL BEHAVIOR
Percentage distributions of measures of sexual behavior among the ethnic groups by marital status are presented in Table 2. As Table 2 indicates, 58 per cent of never-married sexually experienced women had their first sexual experience before age 17. There is considerable variation in sexual experience before age 17 across the ethnic groups from 43.1 per cent among Ga-Adangbe to 66.7 per cent among Mole-Dagbani women. Fifty-nine

per cent and 56.3 per cent of Twi and Fante women respectively acknowledged having sex before age 17. Six of every ten of never-married sexually experienced Other Akans, Ewe and Guans/Others reported having sex before age 17.
There are significant variations in the prevalence of sexual intercourse before age 17 across ethnic backgrounds for evermarried women. Among Twi, Fante, and Other Akans women almost six of every ten women had sex before age 17. Fiftyone per cent of Guans/Others women admitted having sex before age 17.Almost 45 per cent of Mole-Dagbani women acknowledged starting sex before age 17. It is worth noting that, except for Ga-Adangbe women, the groups with higher percentages of sexual experience before age 17 among ever-married women practice a matrilineal kinship system, and those with relatively lower percentages have patrilineal systems. This finding lends some support to the patrilineal bias thesis.
There are large differentials across ethnic groups in the prevalence of sexual

experience for never-married women. GaAdangbe women reported a higher incidence of sexual experience (69.9 per cent) than all the other ethnic groups. The lowest level of sexual experience is observed among Mole-Dagbani women.
Eight of every ten ever-married Twi and Ga-Adangbe women reported engaging in sex before marriage. Almost 60 per cent of Mole-Dagbani and Guans/Others women reported premarital sexual experience. More than 70 per cent of Fante, Other Akans, and Ewe women acknowledged having had sex before marriage.
MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS
Sexual intercourse before age 17.-- Table 3 shows results of the logistic regression analysis of sexual initiation before age 17 for never-married and ever-married women separately. In Model I only GaAdangbe background emerges as a significant predictor of sexual experience before age 17. The probability that a Ga-Adangbe woman had sex before age 17 is 50 per cent lower than her counterpart in the

24

reference group. When relevant correlates of sexual behavior are controlled, the importance of ethnic background on the likelihood of sexual initiation before age 17 among never-married women does not change (Model II).
Among ever-married women, Fante, Other Akans, and Mole-Dagbani ethnic backgrounds significantly influence sexual experience before age 17 (Model HI). The likelihood of having sex before age 17 is positively associated with Fante and Other Akans backgrounds (odds = 1.216 and 1.199, respectively). Women belonging to the Mole-Dagbani group show a lower likelihood of sexual initiation before age 17 (odds = 0.726). Controlling for selected predictors of sexual behavior, we find the impact of ethnic background on the odds of sexual experience before age 17 continues to persist for the same three groups as in the reduced model. Also, for the first time, Guans/Others background emerges as a significant predictor of having sex before age 17 in Model IV.
Premarital sexual intercourse.--The relationship between ethnic background and premarital sexual experience is investigated by modeling four separate logistic regression equations (Table 4). Model V shows that Ga-Adangbe background increases the odds (odds = 1.726) of sexual experience for never-married women. In contrast, Mole-Dagbani background induces lower odds of sexual experience for never-married women. Model VI shows that even after controls, the relationship between ethnic background and sexual experience does not change.
Model VH shows the relationship between ethnicity and premarital sexual experience among five of the six groups for ever-married women. Other Akans, GaAdangbe, and Ewe women exhibit a higher

propensity for premarital sexual experience. On the other hand, Guans/Others and Mole-Dagbani women show a lower likelihood of sexual experience before marriage. Model VHI indicates that after other predictors of sexual behavior are controlled, the impact of Other Akan background on premarital sexual experience vanishes. However, the influence of Ga-Adangbe, Ewe, Guans/Others, and Mole-Dagbani backgrounds on the likelihood of sexual experience before marriage persists.
DISCUSSION
The GDHS 1993 data suggest that sexual intercourse often starts at an early age among women in Ghana. Almost 60 per cent and 53 per cent of never-married and ever-married women respectively started having sex before age 17. The level of premarital sexual experience is not different. About 58 per cent of never-married women were sexually experienced at the time of the survey. Seventy-two per cent of ever-married women acknowledged having sex before marriage. The high incidence of sexual behavior reported here might suggest that cultural norms and controls do not strongly influence socialization, particularly adolescent sexual behavior in Ghana.
However, findings from this exploratory study suggest the possible effect of cultural values and norms in predicting sexual behavior. The likelihood that specific subgroup norms, customs, and practices would influence a woman's sexual behavior is related to her marital status. Cultural background is more likely to influence sexual behavior among the ever-married women than their never-married counterparts.
Ga-Adangbe is the only ethnic background that influences sexual experience

before age 17 for never-married women. The analyses reveal that for the evermarried women, the matrilineal ethnic groups (Twi and Other Akan) exhibit a higher likelihood of having sex before 17. In contrast, ethnic groups that practice a patrilineal system (Guans/Others and Mole-Dagbani) demonstrate lower odds of sexual experience before age 17. These findings partially support the patrilineal bias thesis.
The relationship between ethnic background and sexual behavior is more pro-

found in premarital sexual experience. The only predictor of sexual experience for never-married women is ethnic background (Ga-Adangbe and Mole-Dagbani). The findings suggest that for both GaAdangbe and Mole-Dagbani never-married women cultural norms and practices significantly influence their decision to start having sex.
The data suggest that for ever-married women, an ethnic background of four of the six groups significantly influences the propensity to be sexually experienced

every aspect of life" (Bleek, 1987, p. 139), including sexual behavior. The most important determinant of a child's identity, rights, and status is the maternal lineage. This situation has created a cultural norm where children are welcome to the mother's lineage with less concern about mother's marital status at the time of birth. Therefore, young girls may enter into sexual relations with less concern about the consequences of such behavior (Caldwell et al., 1989; Sarpong, 1977, 1974; Fortes, 1954).
In contrast, the patrilineal Ewe, GaAdangbe, Mole-Dagbani, and Guans/ Others are more conservative ethnic groups. They observe more sexual taboos than matrilineal groups (Huber, 1993; Nukunya, 1992; Dery, 1987). Because heritage is traced through the father, marital status of a woman at birth is critical. The patrilineal groups impose more restrictions on premarital sexual relations. Girls are given less latitude when it comes to premarital sexual intercourse, and marriage is very important in such groups (Huber, 1993; Nukunya, 1992).
The other correlates of sexual behavior deserve some attention. For never-married women, having a secondary/higher education results in a lower propensity to engage in sex before age 17. This finding does not support the popular notion that education promotes teenage sexual experience. The general explanation of this observation is that the perceived access to future options in life may deter early onset of sexual activity and unintended parenthood. This finding has been corroborated by earlier studies based on data from other African countries (see Gage and Meekers, 1994; Nichols et al., 1987). There is an inverse relationship between age at marriage and sexual experience be-

fore age 17 for ever-married women. This finding implies that the high incidence of sexual experience before age 17 for evermarried is potentially related to early age at marriage.
The propensity to engage in premarital sex is positively associated with education and age at marriage. These findings are not as contradictory as they may appear. Similar observations have been reported in Africa (Twa-twa, 1997; Kiragu, 1991; Feyisetan and Pebley, 1989). For instance, Feyisetan and Pebley (1989) have documented higher rates of premarital sexual experience among women with secondary or post-secondary education than women with lower levels of education. In the context of declining age at first menarche in Ghana (Adadevoh, et al., 1989), the risk of premarital sexual activity is likely to increase as young girls stay in school longer and delay marriage.
As expected, the older age-cohort women display lower odds of sexual initiation before age 17 as well as premarital sexual experience. Also, women raised in rural areas show lower odds of premarital sexual experience. These findings may be explained in the context of social control over sexual behavior when the 35-49 years olds were growing up as well as the conservative culture and traditionalism dominant in rural areas. These findings support an earlier study using data from Ghana (Addai, forthcoming).
In another context, the higher odds of premarital sex among women who have attained a secondary/higher education may be related to deteriorating economic conditions facing most African countries which tend to place young women at risk of sexual encounters. Reports abound, particularly in countries of sub-Saharan Africa undergoing structural adjustment programs,

of young women conceding to pressures from older men and trading sexual favors for school fees, food, transportation, and clothing in order to continue their education, to support their families, or simply to survive (Hawkins et al., 1992; Barker and Rich, 1992; Standing, 1989).
While suggesting an association between ethnic background and sexual behavior, the findings of this study leave a number of important issues unresolved. The extent to which relationship between ethnic background and sexual behavior observed in this study support delineated hypotheses is not clear. Recently, studies have found gender differences in sexual behavior in Africa (Anarfi, 1991; Orubuloye et al., 1991). Whether the impact of cultural norms, values, and practices vary between women and men can not be answered by this study because of lack of data on men. Another issue concerns the omission of potentially key predictors of sexual behavior. Limitations imposed by our data call for caution in generalizing thefindings.
CONCLUSIONS
Nothwithstanding the above issues, the findings of this study are important to African population programs, particularly in the context of increased efforts by international donors to target their family planning and reproductive health programs at subnational areas and groups. The main policy implication of the study is the need to develop culturally relevant reproductive health and family planning programs for various groups.
The differential impact of ethnic background on sexual activities studied in this paper suggests that for reproductive health and family planning programs to achieve a respectable measure of success

in the fight against HIV/AIDS and teenage pregnancies, programs have to take into account the cultural milieu. The programs must be African and particularly directed to the different ethnic groups. International, nongovernmental organizations and national policy makers should not regard all Africans as alike, but rather should determine the unique situational and cultural environments of the many different ethnic groups.
The need for group-specific programs is reinforced by the fact that cultural beliefs in many African societies promote female sexual submissiveness, polygamy, male dominance, and sexual violence. All these factors reduce the possibility of a young girl refusing sexual relations (NRC, 1997). Understanding of groupspecific norms, values, and beliefs which tend to put young women at risk can help address the HIV and STD's problems.
The economic and sociocultural environments of African societies are such that the only programs likely to make a difference in efforts to contain HIV infection in Africa are ones based on the ethnic groups' norms and practices. For example, the ritualized forms of conduct which acknowledge a young person's postpubertal status may be a useful tool for minimizing the likelihood of early sexual onset, teenage pregnancies, and hence the risk of HIV infection. An empirical study of initiation rites in the various cultural groups in Africa might provide a key to designing programs and strategies acceptable to different ethnic groups. For instance, girls' initiation ceremonies in Ghana such as Bragro among Ashantis and Dipo among Krobos (Huber, 1993; Sarpong, 1977, 1974), can provide a medium for diffusing knowledge about risks in various traditional sexual

practices as well as the need for family planning. Such strategies have thepotential to be successful because they preserve unique aspects of a group's culture and atthe same time introduce changes in behavior and attitudes.
This study also suggests that another way to minimize early sexual onset, the risk of HIV infection, andpregnancies in Africa is to promote education forwomen to atleast the secondary level. This suggestion hasbeen echoed in the literature for ages. What is required now is for health and population experts to be less concerned about mechanisms through which education effects population and health change. Efforts should be geared toward understanding correlates ofwomen's educational attainment in Africa. Educational policies which have been put in place in the region have been shaped largely by thesociocultural forces endemic in particular societies (see Logan etal., 1996).
The assumption that availability of educational facilities automatically trans-

lates into higher educational opportunities forwomen may bemisleading. International nongovernmental organizations and governments trying to address health and population problems in Africa need to come toterms with how women canbe encouraged to attain at least a secondary education. The most baffling thing is the on-going decline in school enrollment, especially for girls in Africa. The supposed free-education policy in most African countries may notbe enough to bring women into the educational system and to keep them there without taking into account cultural factors preventing women from going toschool.
In an era when African countries are challenged to find the right mixof policies and programs to bring about progress, particularly in reproductive health, the significance of group-specific strategies in dealing with health problems such as HIV infection prevention as well as women's educational issues cannot be neglected.
