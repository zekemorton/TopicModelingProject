head was an unskilled worker, farmer, or farm laborer. Among Democrats, differences in the occupation of the household head were not associated with differences in attitudes. Members of households whose head was a farmer or farm laborer seemed more likely in relation to other occupational groupings among Democrats to support population control; but a comparison of the farmer--farm laborer occupational grouping with the two occupational groupings--professional-business executive and unskilled worker--having the most similar attitude distributions yielded nonsignificant differences; thus, the farmer-farm laborer grouping cannot be said to stand out from the occupational groupings among Democrats.
In both political parties, income differ-

ences were associated with attitudinal differences. Among Republicans, $7,000 constituted an important breaking point, with those in families earning less than $7,000 appreciably less likely than those in families earning more to feel that population limitation is necessary. Among Democrats, a family income under $3,000 was associated with less support for population limitation than was a family income of $3,000-$6,999; in turn, Democrats in families earning $3,000$6,999 were less favorable toward population control than Democrats in families with an income of $7,000 or more.
For both parties, differences in age were associated with differences in attitudes. Among Republicans, those under 30 were more likely to feel population limitation is

130

necessary than those 30-49, who in turn were more likely to consider population limitation necessary than those 50 years of age and older. Among Democrats, those under 30 were more favorable to population limitation than those 30-59, who in turn exhibited a more positive attitude toward population control than those 60 years of age and older.
In a breakdown by race, both political parties exhibited significant attitudinal differences. Among Republicans and Democrats, Caucasians were more likely than Negroes to feel population control was necessary. The difference between the races was noticeably greater among Republicans than Democrats.
With regard to population of area of residence, both Republicans and Democrats exhibited significant attitudinal differences when examined on this variable. Among Republicans, the major break was between residents of areas of under 2,500 population and residents of areas with greater population, the latter being more likely than the former to view population control as necessary. Among Democrats, residents of areas with under 2,500 population and residents of areas with a population of 250,000 or larger were more favorable toward population limitation than residents of areas of 2,500-249,999 population.
Section of the country differentiated both political parties in terms of attitudes. Among Republicans, while no appreciable differences existed between sections in the proportion feeling population control was not necessary, those living in the South were less likely to consider population control necessary than those living elsewhere. Among Democrats, those living in the South were less likely to consider population limitation necessary than those in the East or Midwest, who in turn were less likely to see population limitation as necessary than those in the West. However, the proportion of Democrats viewing population control as

not necessary was about the same in the Midwest as in the South and about the same in the East as in the West.
Finally, it would seem important to delineate the subgroups characterized by an appreciable degree of uncertainty regarding the necessity of population limitation. Among Republicans, two subgroups were characterized by at least 20% "Don't Know" responses: those with no more than a Grade 8 education and those living in the South. Four subgroups in the Democratic Party possessed a 20% or higher "Don't Know" response rate: those with no more than Grade 8 schooling, those in families earning under $3,000 annually, those living in cities of at least a million in population,3 and those living in the East.
CONCLUSION
What general conclusions can be derived from a survey of the data? In the first place, the evidence indicates that the Republican Party is likely to take a formal position favoring population control measures earlier than the Democratic Party. Those whose goal is formal action by a political party aimed at controlling population growth should find the Republican Party more amenable than the Democratic Party to such action. Among Republicans, support for population limitation measures is more likely to come from those with at least a high-school diploma rather than those with less education, those who are members of households whose head is a white-collar or skilled worker rather than members of households whose head is an unskilled worker, farmer, or farm laborer, those in families earning at least $7,000 rather than those in families earning less, those under 50 years of age rather than those older, Caucasians rather than Negroes, and those living outside the South rather than those living in the South.
3Among Democrats, 21% did not know as opposed to 13% among Republicans.

Vol. 17, No. 2

Population Limitation

131

Among Democrats, support for population limitation measures will come most readily from those with college experience, those in families earning at least $7,000 annually, those under 30 years of age, Caucasians, those living in areas with under 2,500 population or over 250,000 population, and those living in the West.
Finally, in an analysis of RepublicanDemocrat attitudinal differences in subpopulations only one subpopulation--that of persons 21-39years of age--generally continued to show Republicans more favorable to population limitation than Democrats.

Except in this subpopulation--which consists of persons born from 1930 through1948 --Republican-Democrat attitudinal differences generally did not continue to exist.
