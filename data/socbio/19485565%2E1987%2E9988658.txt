ABSTRACT: The present study attempted to identify situations that would lead subjects to endorse euthanasia when no implicit assumption about the inevitability of death was made. Participants in the study were 54 males and 47 females enrolled in introductory psychology courses at the University of California, Los Angeles. Subjects indicated how likely they would be to endorse euthanasia in specific hypothetical situations for themselves and for each of their parents. When a factor analysis was conducted on the self situations, four factors were identified: (1) physical condition and pain; (2) external sanction, financial hardship, and emotional stress; (3) mental alertness; and (4) lowered expectation of recovery. A factor analysis was also conducted on the parents' situations and four slightly different factors were obtained. The results indicate that different decisional criteria are used for self than for parents. Also, the decision to terminate another's life appears to involve the consideration of more factors than the decision to terminate one's own life. Neither sex nor religious affiliation differences were found to be related to the endorsement of euthanasia. However, a significant relationship was found between endorsement of euthanasia and low scores on a religiosity measure when subjects were divided into low and high scorers.

Modern technology allows maintenance of life via life-support systems long after bodies would have ceased normal functioning. This capability raises an important question: Under what conditions are decisions made to prolong or to terminate life? The issue of euthanasia has caused a great deal of controversy.
The term euthanasia is denned in Webster's dictionary as: "an easy death; the act or practice of killing individuals that are hopelessly sick or injured for reasons of mercy." People often remark that their pets were "put out of their misery" or that they were "put to sleep." Although this merciful action is instantly recommended for animals, people are reluctant to consider euthanasia for human beings.
Euthanasia can be further denned in terms of whether it is active or passive and voluntary or involuntary. Activeeu-

thanasia is considered an intentional act that causes death (e.g., a lethal injection of medication), whereas passive euthanasia is an intentional act to avoid the prolongation of life (e.g., removing a life-support system) (Hunter, 1980). The two categories are not mutually exclusive, however. For example, the discontinuance of a life-support system can also be viewed as an intentional act that directly causes death. Involuntary euthanasia refers to termination of the life of an infant, child, or mentally retarded or otherwise similarly impaired person who has not requested an early death, whereas voluntary euthanasiarefers to termination of the life of a competent person who has specifically asked for such assistance (Meier and Cassel, 1983).
Many early studies concerning euthanasia were merely surveys about attitudes toward euthanasia, and research-

Although results are inconsistent, some religious affiliation differences have been reported. Some studies showed that Catholics and Jews tended to hold more negative attitudes toward euthanasia than Protestants (Feifel and Schag, 1980; Kalish, 1963; Singh, 1979), whereas Ostheimer's survey results (1980) indicated that Jews were more likely to advocate euthanasia than Protestants and Catholics.
Ethnic differences have also been reported. Feifel and Schag (1980) found Caucasians more accepting of euthanasia than Blacks and Mexican-Americans. Jorgenson and Neubecker (1981) also found Caucasians more accepting of euthanasia than were minorities. In their study, however, ethnic differences could not be determined because ethnicity was categorized into two groups: "White" and "Black and other." Generally, no sex differences in attitudes towards euthanasia have been found (Kalish, 1963; Ostheimer, 1980), although Jorgenson and Neubecker (1981) did find males somewhat more accepting of euthanasia than females.
In previous studies, when people were asked about their attitudes toward euthanasia, multiple aspects of the proposed euthanasia situation were combined (Jorgenson and Neubecker, 1981; Kearl and Harris, 1981; Nagi and Lazerine, 1982; Ostheimer, 1980). For ex-

nation. One is not able to determine whether the person advocates euthanasia based upon the incurable-disease component (i.e., inevitability of death), the legal component (i.e., social sanction), the patient-and-family's request component (i.e., freedom of choice), or some unique combination of the three.
A study by Nagi and Lazerine (1982) did attempt to identify specific conditions under which members of the clergy would justify passive euthanasia for the terminally ill. The purpose of Nagi and Lazerine's study was to determine whether death education and deathcounseling training affected the decision process. No definitive conclusions about death education and death-counseling training could be drawn from their results because they found more withingroup than between-group variation. However, they did conclude that religious affiliation (e.g., Catholic or Jewish) was not a critical variable in the decision process. In one of their conditions, Nagi and Lazerine asked members of the clergy whether they would justify passive euthanasia in the case of "intolerable pain and psychological strain." Again, different aspects of the person's situation (e.g., "psychological strain" and "intolerable pain") were presented as if they were a single factor. As in the Kearl and Harris study, one cannot determine whether subjects ad-

vocated euthanasia based upon the intolerable-pain aspect, the psychologicalstrain aspect, or some unique combination of the two. In addition, Nagi and Lazerine had members of the clergy assume that the person was terminally ill.
The present study attempted to expand upon the conditions presented in Nagi and Lazerine's study and to clarify the individual factors which influence people's decisions to terminate life. Specific situations were to be considered separately with no implicit assumption about the inevitability of death. Although decisions to terminate life may be affected by whether the euthanasia is presented as active, passive, voluntary, or involuntary, these factors were not studied here. Subjects were asked to indicate which specific situations would justify euthanasia for themselves and for each of their parents. To the authors' knowledge, no previous research has studied attitudes about euthanasia for parents. A parent condition was included in this study to present subjects with a realistic situation with which they might some day be confronted. The present study thus examined whether people would endorse euthanasia in different situations for themselves than they would for their mothers or their fathers.
Another purpose of the study was to determine if religiosity affected the decision. That is, would low and high scorers on a religious measure differ in their likelihood to endorse euthanasia and in the circumstances under which they would do so?
MATERIALS AND METHODS
SUBJECTS
Fifty-four males and forty-seven females in introductory psychology

courses at the University of California, Los Angeles, participated in this study (iV=101). Two-thirds of the subjects were college freshmen and sophomores. The rest of the sample was made up of 20 juniors, 10 seniors, and 1 graduate student. The ethnic composition of the sample was: 52 Whites, 24 Asians, 11 Blacks, 9 Mexican Americans, 1 Native American, and 1 Middle Easterner. Self-reported religious affiliation resulted in 27 subjects identifying themselves as having few or no religious beliefs, 25 Protestants, 22 Roman Catholics, 17 Jews, and 10 of other backgrounds (e.g., Eastern Orthodox, Mormon, Buddhist, Hindu, or Islam).
MEASURES
Faulkner and DeJong's religious measure (1965) was selected for this study because it was originally developed with a college population. It is also considered a useful general measure of religiosity (Robinson and Shaver, 1973).
PROCEDURE
A questionnaire containing hypothetical euthanasia situations based upon situations used in other studies was constructed by the experimenters. The questionnaire was pretested on 18 students in introductory psychology courses at the University of California, Los Angeles, and was modified as a result of the pilot testing (see Table 1). When subjects were asked to consider euthanasia for each parent, a situation was added which did not appear when the subjects were asked to consider euthanasia for themselves (i.e., if the mother/father expresses a wish to die).
The questionnaire, which took 20 minutes to complete, included: (1) demographic information (e.g., sex, ethnic-

recommend euthanasia both for themselves and for their parents. Subjects also slightly endorsed euthanasia for themselves in Situation 2 (i.e., "diagnosed as mentally incapacitated") and for parents in Situation 17 (i.e., mother/ father tells you that she/he wishes to die).
A f-test was conducted between subject's ratings for all the mother items and subject's ratings for all the father items. Although there is a slight tendency to advocate euthanasia under more situations for mother than for father, there was no significant difference between the two groups, t(99) = -1.24, p> 0.05. Because of thisfinding,the ratings for mother and father were combined into oneparents'rating for all subsequent analyses.
A /-test was also conducted between the subject's ratings for all self items and his or her ratings for all parents items. There was a significant difference be-

tween subject's self ratings (M = --0.93) and parents' ratings ( M = - 1 . 5 9 ) , t(95) = 8.46, /7<0.001. Thus, across all situations, subjects were more likely to recommend euthanasia for themselves than for their parents.
Tables 3 and 4 present the results of a factor analysis for the self and the parents' euthanasia situations respectively. Initially, a criterion of a factor loading of 0.6 or higher was used to include a situation to define a factor. If no situations loaded at 0.6, the highest loadings above 0.35 were used. If a euthanasia situation loaded high on two or more factors, it was assigned to the factor where it yielded the most conceptual purity. For example, parents' Situation 14 (i.e., termination is sanctioned by physician) loads highest on Factor 3 (0.492), but was included under Factor 4 (0.424) because it relates more to external sanction than it does to mental alertness or parents' wish.

dure, four factors for self and four factors for parents were identified. The factors appeared to cluster around these dimensions: (1) person-related, such as diminished mental and physical ability and the amount of pain experienced; (2) how the person's condition affects others; and (3) whether recovery was possible. The factor analysis results for the parents showed external sanction was a factor by itself, and the parents' expressed wish was an additional consideration in the mental alertness factor. The factors identified here were used in subsequent analyses by creating factor scores for each subject. Factor scores were the arithmetic sum of the component situations, that is, the values selected for the individual situations ( - 3 to + 3) were summed across those situations comprising each factor.

No sex differences were found when Mests were conducted on the derived factor scores. There were also no significant differences across five religious affiliations (i.e., no religious beliefs, Protestants, Catholics, Jewish, and others) when a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted on factor scores. Since most studies have conducted analyses primarily on the major religious groups, a separate ANOVA was conducted on Catholics (n = 22), Protestants (n = 22), and Jews {n = 17). Again, no significant differences were found.
A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was also conducted across ethnic groups for each factor. Since some ethnic groups had small sample sizes, subjects were placed in one of three categories: Asian (n = 24), White

DISCUSSION
The purpose of the study was to identify separate situations which would affect endorsement of euthanasia. Once situations and dimensions were determined, we examined whether the decision to terminate life was similar for self, mother, and father, and whether demographic variables or religiosity affected this decision process.
Results indicate that when faced with a life or death decision, men and women respond similarly. This result is consistent with the findings of other researchers. Subjects used different criteria in the decision to terminate their own lives as opposed to their parents' lives. The data from the factor analysis suggest that more variables are taken into account when one contemplates euthanasia for parents than for self in similar situations. That is, a person is more definite about what situations would justify euthanasia for themselves, but the decision is not as clearly defined when it involves one's parents. This finding

makes intuitive sense since the decision to end another person's life is much more complicated ethically, morally, and legally than the decision to end one's own life.
Due to small sample sizes, the present study was not able to test for some of the ethnic differences previously reported by researchers (Feifel and Schag, 1980; Jorgenson and Neubecker, 1981).The analysis that was conducted on ethnic composition (e.g., Asian, White, Other) found Asians and other minorities did not endorse euthanasia to the extent that Whites did when considering parents' mental alertness and wish. While this finding confirms results of earlier studies (Feifel and Schag, 1980;Jorgenson and Neubecker, 1981), it appears to contradict the Asian cultural norm that children should always obey parents. Future studies need a more representative ethnic sample to further explore cultural differences in advocating euthanasia.
Contrary to previous research findings and the experimenters' expecta-

tions, no significant differences were found among religious affiliations. This nonsignificant finding could be due to the greater degree of within-group variation than between-group variation as Nagi and Lazerine (1982) had previously found. According to the results of the present study and Nagi and Lazerine's study, dichotomization of religiosity (e.g., low vs. high) is more useful in predicting a person's decision to terminate life than religious affiliation. The present study's results are consistent with the previous research finding that highly religious people are less approving of euthanasia than people with little or no religious beliefs. Significant differences in ratings between the lowreligiosity group and the high-religiosity group were found for two of the four self factors and three of the four parents' factors.
The factor which accounted for the most variance in the subject's self ratings was physical condition and pain (i.e., self Factor 1). Since subjects were college students, people who typically are concerned about physical health and fitness, the finding that physical condition and pain is an important factor in the decision to terminate life is not surprising. One must be careful, however, not to make the assumption that the factor accounting for the most variance is also most important in the person's decision to terminate life. Given the design of the present study, this assumption cannot be made. One can determine the factors which account for the most variance in the decision process, but one cannot assume their order of importance. To determine the relative importance of the euthanasia situations, future studies would need to ask subjects to rank-order the situations from least important to most important.
Future studies should also explore

whether euthanasia is an easier decision for self and a more complicated decision for all others or whether there is a further distinction between decisions for parents/family members and decisions for "generalized others." To test this hypothesis, one would need to include a "generalized other--male" category and a "generalized other--female" category. Perhaps ethnic differences would be more apparent in that cultures emphasizing close-knit family structures (e.g., Asians and Hispanics) would differentiate between self and parents and generalized others, while Whites might differentiate only between self and all others.
Finally, future studies should present combinations of euthanasia situations to see if they contribute additively to the decision process. For example, if excruciating pain is combined with being confined to bed for the rest of one's life, is endorsement of euthanasia under the combined situation related to endorsement of both individual situations? That is, can the two separate ratings be combined additively to determine a rating that approximates the person's endorsement of euthanasia when the two situations are presented as one?
Since society will increasingly face the question of euthanasia, it is important to continue to study the correlates of attitudes toward euthanasia.
