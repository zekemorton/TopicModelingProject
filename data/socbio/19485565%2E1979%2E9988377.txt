ABSTRACT:This research analyzed physicians' attitudes toward and use of genetic counseling. Data were obtained through mailed questionnaires sent to all 445 general and family practitioners, pediatricians, and obstetrician-gynecologists in private practice and involved in direct patient care in Maricopa and Pima Counties, Arizona. Results indicated strong attitudinal support for genetic counseling. Almost all respondents felt that it was a useful and necessary medical service, and most felt that it resulted in more responsible patient decisions. Actual genetic counseling by physicians was comparatively rare, however. The data suggested that the paucity of counseling may have derived from a lack of training in genetics, scarcity of patient requests, and legal naivete. Genetic counseling, amniocentesis, and abortion received the most support from younger physicians, obstetrician-gynecologists, and those who were Jewish, less religious, and had few or no children.

Since the beginning of this century, massive changes have occurred in the distribution and extent of diseases. Infectious diseases have decreased in importance due to public health campaigns, gradual improvements in the standard of living for most Americans, and medical advances such as the various antibiotics and vaccines. At the same time, medicine has developed technology which has reduced mortality rates for both defective infants and the elderly. As the incidence of infectious disease decreases, while survival rates for those with genetic conditions increase, we can expect that genetic disease will form a growing share of all medical problems.
Awareness of this epidemiological change has in recent years led both government agencies and individual physicians to begin to refocus their energies in order better to combat genetic disease. For some genetic diseases, such as phenylketonuria, reasonably effective treatment

exists. No true cures for genetic disease will be available, however, unless and until genetic manipulation becomes technically--and legally--feasible. In the meantime, the best tools at our disposal are screening individuals at risk to determine their genetic status and providing genetic counseling when appropriate in order to prevent the birth of genetically defective infants and in order rapidly to identify and treat those who are born.
Genetic counseling is a relatively new area in medicine,Jas witnessed by the fact that it only received a separate listing in Index Medicus as of 1973. As with most innovations, we can assume that genetic counseling will face a certain amount of resistance, among both physicians and patients. A number of researchers (e.g. Kaback et al., 1974; Becker et al., 1975; Childs et al., 1976) have studied characteristics of patients who volunteer for

(GC). Ninety per cent believed that GC results in more responsible reproductive decisions, and 82 per cent felt that such information should be offered as part of regular prenatal and family planning (cf. Naylor, 1975). Ninety-three per cent agreed with the statement that "GC is both a useful and necessary medical service."
The provision of amniocentesis (which significantly affects the potential usefulness of GC) also found general support among the respondents. Most felt that amniocentesis would be a good idea if a genetic disorder had already appeared in a family (86 per cent agreeing in the case of Down's syndrome, and 89 per cent agreeing when Tay-Sachs was a possibility). More than half (61 per cent) favored advising amniocentesis for all pregnant patients over age 35. However, amniocentesis to satisfy parental curiosity about the sex of a fetus was strongly rejected; only 2 per cent considered it a good idea.
If a genetic defect was found, the physicians generally agreed that abortion might be appropriate. Only 4 per cent rejected abortion categorically. Seventy-four per cent felt it would be a good idea if a fetus was diagnosed as having Tay-Sachs syndrome, 65 per cent if Down's syndrome was the diagnosis, but only 47 per cent if Turner's syndrome was evident.
As Table 1 shows, all three of these medical services (GC, amniocentesis, and abortion) found the most support among Jewish physicians and the least support among Catholic physicians.3 Amniocentesis and abortion were both judged most favorably by those with few or no children and by those who did not consider religion very important in their lives (Tables 2 and 3). Age significantly affected only attitude to GC, with younger physicians exhibiting

more approval (Table 4). Physicians in the various specialties did not differ significantly on their attitudes to GC and amniocentesis, but pediatricians were significantly less supportive of abortion than were OBG's and GP's (Table 5).
FACTORS AFFECTING THE USE OF
GENETIC COUNSELING
Compared to the level of attitudinal support for GC, reported GC behavior was relatively low.4 Twenty-one per cent reported that they or their assistants frequently counseled patients regarding the possibility of Down's syndrome, but only 9 per cent reported frequently counseling regarding genetic disorders other than Down's. One-fifth reported that neither they nor their assistants had ever provided any GC.5 Younger physicians and OBG's provided GC significantly more frequently than did others (Table 6 and 7).
The data suggested a few possible explanations for the apparent discrepancy between attitudinal support and actual counseling behavior. The next few paragraphs will discuss the effects of four factors--patient requests, physician training, legal naivet6, and referral to professional counselors--on frequency of GC by primary practitioners.6
It appears from the data that unless patients requested GC, physicians rarely offered such services. Of those who frequently received requests, 56 per cent frequently referred patients to a genetic
4This has to remain a rather subjective and abstract statement, since there is no way of knowing how frequently counseling would occur in an "ideal" situation.
5Unfortunately, it is impossible to make any comparisons to Naylor's data, since he combined those doctors who provided GC with those who had been asked to provide GC.
6For this purpose, GC behavior was measured by a summary scale, which averaged frequency of counseling regarding Down's syndrome with frequency of counseling regarding any other genetic disease.

counselor and the same percentage frequently provided GC themselves. By contrast, among those who had never received such a request, only 3 per cent had ever referred and only 1 per cent had ever themselves provided GC. Patient requests for these services occurred rather infrequently. Despite recent media coverage, 23 per cent of the physicians had never been asked to provide GC, and 39 per cent reported rarely receiving such a request. Only 8 per cent overall (but 27 per cent of the OBG's) frequently received requests for such services.
Another possible explanation for the infrequency of counseling by physicians may be the physicians' lack of knowledge of genetics. The need for such training was clearly recognized; fully 95 per cent believed that education in GC should be offered as a regular part of medical training. In actual fact, however, fewer than one-third of the respondents (30 per cent) had taken a course in genetics during medical school, and only 31 per cent of the OBG's (16 per cent overall) had any training in that subject during their internship or residency.7
The extent of training was significantly

correlated with both counseling and referring. Eighteen per cent of those who received training in genetics during medical school and postgraduate education frequently counseled, compared to 6 per cent of those without such training. Almost identical proportions frequently referred patients to genetic counselors. However, these data cannot tell us whether increased education produced increased support for GC, or whether those who were more interested in GC sought out such training.
Legal naivete also may explain the limited amount of counseling by primary practitioners.8 Although 71 per cent believed that some clients could probably or definitely bring a successful suit against their doctors for not providing GC, only one-third (32 per cent) of the physicians overall (but twice as many OBG's) had heard of such a case. Cases of this sort have, in fact, occurred in New York and California.
Doctors who knew of successful suits, as well as those who simply believed in the possibility of such a suit, were more likely than others to provide GC and to refer patients to professional genetic counselors.

7These statistics appear in line with national trends. Sorensen and Culbert (1977) found that only 60 per cent of accredited medical schools in the United States offered a course in clinical genetics, and 75 per cent of these courses were given as electives.

8This research was originally planned for California. Plans were changed when protests indicated that fear of malpractice suits among California physicians overwhelmed the effects of any other variables. It was hoped that this fear might be less severe in another geographical region.
