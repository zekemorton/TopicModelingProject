ABSTRACT: Genealogical records containing birth and death dates for completed families have been analyzed to compare the longevity of twins, sibs and parents. The data are restricted to twins and sibs whosurvived to adulthood and married. Thefindings,similar to those found with respect to fertility (Wyshak and White, 1969), show that twins, especially male twins, are disadvantaged in comparison with their male sibs. Sib-sib and parent-offspring correlation analysis confirmed that there is a genetic component in the determination of life span, but environmental factors contribute more to the total variation. No evidence of a stronger maternal than paternal effect was found. Twin bearers also lived longer than nontwin bearers. Even among persons who survived to age SO or more, parents of twins had more children and lived slightly longer than their twin and nontwin offspring. Regression analysis for persons who survived to SO or longer indicated that, in addition to life span of parents, secularity (year of death) andfertility (number of children borne) were the best predictors of longevity, though only a small proportion of the variation could be accounted for by these and other demographic variables. Life span has shown a consistent increase over time from the seventeenth century through the nineteenth century, while fertility has tended to decline. However, among persons surviving to age SO, when the relation between secularity and fertility and secularity and longevity is controlled, a significant correlation between fertility and longevity remains. This relation, observed in populations that did not practice voluntary family size limitation, would not be found in contemporary data. Maternal mortality accounted for the shorter life span of women than for men; eliminating its effect gives women a slight advantage. The fertility and longevity experience of migrants whosurvived to age SO is more favorable than that of persons whodid not migrate.

Longevity and the role of heredity in the determination of the life span have long been of interest to scientists. Currently, a group from Johns Hopkins University has been following up the work of the Pearls which was started in the 1920's. The publications of the Hopkins group provide an extensive review of the research in the area of longevity and the human life span (B. H. Cohen, 1964; Hawkins et al., 1965); Abbott et al., 1974). J. E. Cohen (1975) has recently demonstrated an interest in longevity by reanalyzing data on childhood mortality in pre-industrial Europe. Jalavisto (1951) has studied the inheritance of longevity using data from various published genealogies of the Fin-

nish and Swedish nobility and middleclass. Philippe and Yelle (1976), in the course of work on an isolated FrenchCanadian population, have examined the effect of family size on mother's longevity. Kallmann and his coworkers have over several decades been investigating twin pairs with respect to their biological and psychological characteristics in relation to heredity and longevity (Kallmann and Sander, 1948, 1949; Kallmann etal., 1955; Falek et al., 1960; Jarvis et al., 1960).
A number of investigators have found a genetically determined relationship between parental life span and life span of offspring (the Hopkins group, Jalavisto, Kallmann and coworkers). Of special

From Table 2, it is evident that statistically significant correlations in the life span of sibs, parent-offspring, and husband-wife exist. Sibs of the same sex have higher correlations than do persons of opposite sex; the range in correlation coefficients for same-sexed sibs is 0.125 to 0.240. The highest correlation observed is between female co-twins. (As noted above, zygosity determinations cannot be made

0.121; for female combinations, 0.150. Though the female-female correlations appear higher, the difference is not significant. (The method of testing the equality of p's and the method of combining them, using Fisher'sZ transformation, are discussed in Snedecor and Cochran, 1967).
The r's were not found to be different and were combined in the following groups with the resulting average r's:

is that between male-female cotwins, being 0.044. Based on 292 pairs, it is the only value in the table which is not statistically significant at the 5 per cent level. Correlations between parent and offspring tend to be lower than between sibs, but are significant for all parent-offspring combinations in the table, ranging from 0.059 to 0.116. The correlation between husband and wife is relatively high, 0.127, in the same range as the correlation between same-sexed sibs.

Jalavisto (1951) reported that both maternal and paternal longevity tends to increase the mean length of life of the offspring; that the effect of maternal longevity exceeds that of paternal longevity; and that the paternal effect is greater in sons than in daughters. Abbott et al. (1974) also observed that the trend for survival is somewhat more marked in relationship to the mother's age at death than to the father's, and for both groups it is more striking for males than for females.

no very secure conclusions are possible

from their analysis. On the other hand,

Kallmann et al. (1955) found that the ef-

fects of the ages of fathers and mothers on

the life spans of some offspring are vir-

tually the same, while the life-span effect

of middle-aged mothers (55-69) on their

daughters is less pronounced. They com-

ment that the apparent lack of agreement

between their data and those of Jalavisto

(1951) is probably explained by life expec-

tancy differences between the two sam-

ples. Our results agree with those of

Kallmann and his coworkers (1955) that

there is no evidence that correlations be-

tween the life span of mother-offspring are

higher than those for father-offspring.

Using the average r's as obtained from

various sib-sib combinations and parent-

offspring combinations, the formulas

given above can be used to estimate the

components of the variance. Thus, we

have:

Average r^ = 0.075

Average rss = 0.112, all sibs

(1)

Average rss = 0.127, same sex sibs (2)

Average rss = 0.086, opposite sex sibs (3)

Using the three estimates for the correla-

tion between sibs, estimates of

VA JL
VP' V, can be obtained.

Between 64 and 81 per cent of the total variance seems to be environmental. The dominance variance constitutes between 23 and 58 per cent of the total genetic variance. The high environmental value is not surprising since one might expect that environmental correlations between sibs may be stronger than those between parents and offspring. The environmental effect within the same generation is supported by the finding that the correlation between the life spans of husbands and wives, that is, the parents of the offspring, is 0.127, based on 5,457 pairs where birth and death dates are known.
INTRAPAIR COMPARISONS
Although the primary purpose of this paper is to examine and compare longevity of twins with that of their sibs and their parents, comparisons of twin pairs can also be made. However, relatively few pairs, both members of which survived to adulthood and married and for whom birth and death data were recorded on Family Record Sheets, are available for comparison. Table 3 presents the differences in life span of co-twins by twin type.
None of the differences between co-twins differ significantly from zero, supporting Kallmann and Sander's observation (1948) that twins tend to die within three to five years of each other. As shown in Table 2, the correlations in life spans of like-sexed twins (most of whom are co-twins) are slightly higher than the correlations between sib and twins of the same sex.

COMPARISONS OF THE LONGEVITY OF TWINS
AND THEIR SIBS AND THEIR PARENTS
In this section, comparisons of the various subgroups will be made and multiple regression done to determine what factors can be used to predict life span. Most of the families in the Archives are from the United States or Northern Europe; the time period is predominantly the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. As noted above, to ensure that only persons who could not possibly still be alive are considered, the analyses will include only twins and sibs born before 18S0.
Overall comparisons show that twins, both MMtwins and males from MF pairs, are disadvantaged over their brothers, but female twins are not (Table 4). This is consistent with our findings with respect to fertility where it was found that male twins are less fertile than their male sibs (have fewer children), but there were no differences between female twins and female sibs of twins (Wyshak and White, 1969). Even when we compare twins and sibs who survived to age SOor longer, the disadvantage of twins remains. Thus, the view that twins are generally not as longlived as singly born persons (Whittinghill, 1965) and that they are less fertile holds true. While the differences are not great,

they are statistically significant for males. Remembering that we have restricted comparison to twins and sibs who survived the risk of death during the perinatal period and childhood and were healthy enough to marry and to survive to age SO, the difference of one year is significant beyond a statistical finding. Why males should be disadvantaged while females are not is a question that these data cannot answer. It has been speculated (Gifford, unpublished) that "individual differentiation, as an interaction between inherited developmental schedules and the vicissitudes of experience, begins even earlier in intrauterine life, and that the effects of early experience may be as permanent as if they are genetically determined."
When the fertility of twins was compared with that of their parents, it was found that the parents were more fertile (produced more children) (Wyshak and White, 1969). Similarly, parents of twins have a considerably longer life span--an advantage of three to four years over their offspring, both twin and nontwin. The fathers of twins and sibs lived an average of 67.4years; the mothers, 65.Syears (Table 4).
The important difference between the parents and offspring is the fact that to be

MATERNAL DEATH
In the comparison groups considered in the preceding discussion, the life span of males exceeded that of females--a sharp contrast from current demographic findings where the life spans of women exceed those of males by several years. (Table 4). Until well into the twentieth century, women were at high risk of death due to childbearing. (The records available have no indication of cause of death.) For present purposes, a "maternal death" was any death among women which occurred within one year of the birth of the

last child. The data were coded by year (months being disregarded). Thus, if the year of the mother's death minus the year of birth of the last child was less than or equal to one, the woman's death was classified a "maternal death." While recognizing that this rule may yield some false positives (deaths attributed to childbearing which in fact were due to other causes), we classed as "maternal deaths" 528 or 10 percent of the 5,130female twins and female sibs born before 1850 and who had at least one child. The male advantage over females largely disappears when those whose deaths may have been due to childbearing are eliminated from the comparison (Tables 11 and 12). Comparisons of persons who survived to age 50eliminate the advantage of males over females. The sex differences are far less, however, than those based on present-day life table values of expectation of life among U.S. whites.
For 1971, the expectation of life at ages 30 for white males was 41.3 for white females, 47.7 (Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1974, Table 7). Expectation of life at ages 30-31 are selected for comparison since the data analyzed relate only to persons who survived to adulthood and married. Thus, persons in the present era wholive to age 30 have about a seven year advantage, if they are

fertility comparisons, longevity is shorter among male twins than for their male sibs; differences between female twins and their female sibs tend to be negligible. Thus, based on genealogical data, we found that the fitness of twins--fertility (number of children produced) and longevity--is less than that of their singleton sibs. Twin bearers and the husbands of twin-bearers have both a fertility advantage and a longevity advantage over nontwin bearers.
Overall, parents of twins tend to be more fertile than their twin and nontwin offspring; they are also longer lived. However, when comparisons are restricted to persons who survived to age 50 or longer and to those who themselves had twin offspring, the parental advantages diminish considerably. Parents had about six-tenths of a child more, on the average. The life span advantage was slightly greater for fathers over sons; but daughters outlived their mothers by a short time. Because of the secular increase

in life span, the offspring might be expected to have a greater advantage. The finding that offspring do not "do better" than their parents could possibly be explained by regression toward the mean.
Unquestionably, genetic factors play a role in the determination of life span; but environmental factors, not surprisingly, contribute more to the total variation, as found from the analysis of sib-sib and parent-offspring correlations. No evidence of a greater influence of maternal life span over paternal life span on offspring's life span was found, contrary to the findings of Jalavisto (1951) and those of Abbott et al. (1974) who concluded that this is consistent with cytoplasmic inheritance or with X-linkage.
The single most important factor in predicting longevity for persons who survived to age 50 is secularity. Over the period between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, there has been aconsistent increase in the life span. This increase was observed for persons in the

United States, England and Wales, and Northern Europe. Contemporary demographic analyses have shown that life span has continued to increase throughout the twentieth century. Much of the increase has been attributed to a general improvement in environmental conditions.
Fertility (number of children borne) showed a significant correlation with longevity. Obviously, one needs to live longer to produce children. However, when longevity of persons who survived beyond the reproductive age (age SO) is considered, fertility still emerges as a relatively important variable. But only a relatively small proportion of the variation could be explained by the variables included. R2, though small, is statistically significant, ranging from 8 per cent to 11 per cent.
The important finding is the significant relation of fertility and longevity. Such a relation is not found in contemporary demographic data for developed countries such as the United States and Northern Europe because of the voluntary limitation of family size which is widely practiced; small family size, usually correlated with higher socioeconomic status, tends to also be correlated with good health, well-being, and life span. The data of this study, based on historical demographic

records, enable us to examine the relation between fertility and longevity in human populations which did not limit family size voluntarily. A well-known demographic trend is the general decline in family size over the past two or three centuries; our data reflect this decrease in fertility in the United States and Northern Europe. There was a marked negative correlation between fertility (number of children borne) and secularity (year of death). This finding does not, however, negate the observed relation between fertility and longevity, for when the effect of secularity is accounted for by partial correlation, the correlation between fertility and longevity is strengthened.
Energy, health, and fitness are also reflected in the experience of "migrants," here defined as those families where the country of birth of the father differed from that of offspring. Based on an analysis of parents and offspring who survived beyond the reproductive age (SO years), we observe that "migrants" tend to have more children and to live longer than nonmigrants.
