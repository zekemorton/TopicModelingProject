ABSTRACT: Evidence suggests that in contemporary Africa, and probably in the predemographic transition periods of many other populations, desired fertility typically exceeds (or exceeded) achieved fertility and completed family size. The main conceptual approaches employed by economists during the past two decades for the analysis of the determinants of fertility are reviewed and found inadequate because most fail to address circumstances in which demand or desired fertility exceeds supply or actual fertility. An alternative conceptual framework is offered incorporating both demand and supply determinants. Results from numerous studies of African and other populations are found to be consistent with this approach. Data from Tanzania are described and analyzed. Implications of this micro-level conceptual approach for macro-level fertility change are suggested.

ships with economic growths--at least since Malthus, comprehensive and systematic economic analyses of fertility in developing countries date only from the late 1950's. Most of the early work of Leibenstein (1957), Coale and Hoover (1958), and Enke (1960, 1966) focused on the macro-economic consequences of high fertility and high populationgrowth rates.
However, the pioneering conceptual and theoretical contributions of Leibenstein (1957) and Becker (1960) also stimulated substantial work on the micro-economics of fertility, although most of the theoretical developments, modeling, and research have been confined to "demand analysis." The two dominant approaches to demand analysis which emerged in the 1960's were those of Gary Becker and Richard Easterlin. According to the Becker approach, fertility falls because the price effects (price being negatively related to fertility) exceed the income effects (income being positively related to fertility) (see Becker, 1960,1965; Becker and Lewis, 1973). That is, as a result of socioeconomic improvements, the aspirations that parents have for their children cause them to undertake substantially greater child-related expenditures as their incomes rise. This increases the costs per child thereby reducing demand (number desired), and this reduced demand more than offsets any increase in demand due to rising incomes.
Becker assumed that real preferences of parents do not change. Only incomes and prices change, and usually the price effect dominates. However, a rise in income (due to a rise in wage rates) is also expected to have some negative effect on demand for children, because as income rises the value of the time which parents spend on their children also

rises, thus further increasing the price of children (Becker, 1960; Leibenstein, 1957; Schultz, 1973).
In the case of children, there are important conceptual problems in defining a "good." What superficially appear to be similar goods may be perceived by the relevant consumers as being several different goods. Are female and male babies similar goods, and do they provide equivalent levels of utility? (Here utility means satisfaction, enjoyment, or enhanced social status, but it does not include financial value or wealth, since these latter effects would be expressed through prices of children relative to prices of other things.) Does an uneducated child provide utility equivalent to that derived from an educated child? Does a second, or seventh, son provide utility equivalent to that from a first son? These complications led to incorporating into the analysis distinctions between child "quality" and "quantity" (see Becker and Lewis, 1973; Becker and Tomes, 1976; and Cochrane, 1975). Thus, while two uneducated sons may be perceived as equivalent goods, an educated son would be a different good.
Subsequently this body of work came to be known collectively as the "new home economics" (Nerlove, 1974). Practitioners of the "new home economics" proceeded under the implicit assumption that the number of children parents have is also the number they want, i.e., that supply of children and demand for children are in equilibrium. The methodologies used generally did not include variables which might give some indication whether or not supply and demand were in equilibrium, and if not, why not.
Much of the demand analysis research for developing-country populations was undertaken during the early

1970's when most KAP (knowledge, attitude, and practice) studies--with the exception of those carried out in Africa--were showing that achieved family size generally exceeded desired family size. This finding implied that parents perceived an excess supply of children, that is, presuming the responses were valid, supply of children and demand for children were apparently not in equilibrium. Recent research carried out in a large number of developing countries under the auspices of the World Fertility Survey also shows that for a large portion of respondents, achieved family size substantially exceeds desired family size (see, for example, Westoff, 1981).
The distinctive feature of the original Easterlin formulations is that changing aspirations ("tastes and preferences") are possibly a dominant cause of declining parental demand for children (Easterlin, 1966, 1969). Over time, aspirations for non-child goods and services may be increasing relative to aspirations for children. In this interpretation, aspirations of parents are determined by their backgrounds and experiences, particularly during childhood socialization. As aspirations change from one generation to another, as a consequence of socioeconomic modernization or upward social mobility, the average number of children parents want may change as a result of their trying to satisfy desires for both children and other acquisitions within the constraints imposed by their financial and other resources.
Sanderson (1976) provides a comparison of the Becker and Easterlin approaches. He notes a convergence during the 1970's, including the introduction in 1976 of the following somewhat similar concepts: Easterlin (1976) now includes the desire of par-

ents to leave a suitable "wealth bequest" to their children--assumed to be equivalent in real terms to what they received from their own parents--as a potentially important determinant of demand for children. The model developed by Becker and Tomes (1976) incorporates as a determinant of the price of children the level of "child endowment" desired by parents, a concept similar to Easterlin's desired bequest. However, Easterlin expects desired bequests to be determined by parental aspirations formed during childhood and thus unrelated to their incomes as adults, while Becker expects desired levels of expenditures per child (the endowment factor) to be positively related to parental income. The Becker models have not yet explicitly incorporated the possibility of changing aspirations (tastes) over time.
Representing yet a third "school," Leibenstein (1974, 1975) offers a broader concept and meaning for the utility and dis-utility provided by children and how these affect demand. He also stresses the limitations in treating acquisition of children in conventional economic (market) terms; the importance of tastes and preferences and their formation; and the need to broaden the theories to specifically incorporate culturally and socially imposed constraints (one of which he terms "social influence group") on the capacity and/or willingness of individuals to actually make and implement choices in specific life situations (see also Leibenstein, 1977).
INCORPORATING SUPPLY VARIABLESINTO
THE ANALYSIS
Economists have long recognized that acquisition of most goods is a function of both demand characteristics and supply conditions. However, as noted

that directly affect conception, gesta-

A principal objective of Easterlin's early work was to synthesize economic and sociological approaches to provide a fuller understanding of the causes of fertility change. This effort directed considerable attention to the role of aspirations and when and how they are acquired. However, it also drew attention to characteristics which in economic terms affect the production or supply of children, such as fecundity, frequency of intercourse, and the use and efficacy of specific fertility control methods, both traditional and modern.
Subsequently Easterlin and others have explicitly incorporated the determinants of the supply (or production) of children into economic models and anal-

tion, childbirth, and child survival. "Supply of children" here means simply either the actual number of children born or the number surviving. It would include the results of any intentional efforts to space, limit, or terminate childbearing, and in this it differs from the concept "natural fertility" which refers to levels of childbearing which occur in the absence of any deliberate effort-- regardless of parity--to limit total births. Many supply determinants are the so-called intermediate variables first described systematically by Davis and Blake (1956). For purposes of this argument, the supply variables affecting fertility can be conceptualized under three categories:

yses of the determinants of fertility (e.g., Easterlin, 1975, 1978; Kocher, 1977; Jejeebhoy, 1978; Lesthaeghe et al., 1981). This revision permits the analysis of circumstances in which the

Intermediate supply variables that are potential determinants of the spacing between births include the following (see Bongaarts, 1978,1981):
1. Lactational infecundability. 2. Frequency of intercourse (including
sexual abstinence). 3. Sterility. 4. Spontaneous intrauterine mortality.
Frequency of intercourse may in turn be affected by non-demand-related factors such as both voluntary and involuntary separation of spouses and prolonged periods of sexual abstinence due to lactational or other culturallydetermined taboos.
CHANGING DISEQUILIBRIA:
ILLUSTRATING THE HYPOTHESES
The discussion to this point has been primarily limited to the possible effects of intermediate supply and demand variables onfertility. However, presumably the number of surviving children is ultimately of greater importance to parents than the number of children born, and supply and demand can also be conceptualized in terms of surviving children.
Figure 1 is an illustration of hypothesized relationships between supply of surviving children and demand for surviving children for typical women who have completed childbearing. The figure illustrates hypothesized changes in the relative relationships between supply and demand over time as a traditional society undergoes socioeconomic modernization.
As illustrated in the figure, it is hypothesized that in traditional African societies, women typically want more surviving children than they actually end

up with; that is, they experience excess demand. Ware (1975), for example, identified 33 KAP and other surveys carried out in tropical Africa during the 1960's, all of which indicated that desired numbers of children were very high. In all these studies the vast majority of respondents wanted five or more children. A recent national survey in Kenya found that 76 per cent of all women respondents wanted six or more children (Dow and Werner, 1982). However, it is further hypothesized that during the initial phases of socioeconomic, cultural, and demographic transition, women typically have larger numbers of surviving children than previously while the number of surviving children that the typical women would like to have may be smaller than previously, so that eventually women find themselves in excess supply situations.
This is, therefore, a model which postulates the transformation from a traditional society in which women typically have lower fertility than they desire to a modernizing society in which women typically have excess fertility. Tabbarah (1971) was probably the first to advance such a model. The process by which this profound transformation takes place is not simple, probably varies greatly from place to place, and will certainly vary from woman to woman. Nonetheless, evidence from Africa is increasingly consistent with the broad outlines sketched here, and some of the underlying causal relationships are suggested below in the form of hypotheses.
It is hypothesized that in traditional societies the number of surviving children that women end up with is determined (or constrained) by intermediate supply variables. However, one initial consequence of economic, educational, and health improvements is to cause

RESULTS
A SURVEY OF SOME EVIDENCE
Caldwell, in his reformulation of demographic transition theory, essentially argues that African as well as Middle Eastern and South Asian data support the supply constraint hypothesis (Caldwell, 1976, 1977, 1978). He does so by the indirect route of stressing the strong demand for children in tropical Africa, emphasizing the contributions that children make, both economic and socio-psychological, to the welfare of both parents and the larger community. He concludes that in traditional rural African societies the net transfer of societal resources is from younger to older generations. So long as an additional child is a net asset to the parents, demand will exceed supply.
Although Caldwell provides persuasive evidence and analysis supporting the intergenerational wealth-flows hypothesis and its effect on demand for children, it is not necessarily the case that parental demand for children will remain undiminished so long as children continue to be net financial assets to parents. It is also possible that an additional child may be a net financial asset while being at the same time a psychological or physical burden--a liability in nonfinancial terms. If the psychological and/ or physical burden is perceived as being of greater importance than arefinancial considerations, the mother may prefer to avoid another birth even if she thinks the net financial contribution of another would be positive. The opposite is also a

possibility. An additional child may be perceived as a netfinancialliability but a net socio-psychological asset. The parent may want an additional birth if the importance of the latter outweighs the financial considerations.
Additional support for this model is provided by a recent analysis by Dow and Werner (1982) of a 1977-78 national fertility study in Kenya. The sample of 8,100 women ages 15-50 was segmented into the following categories:
Traditional: women who desired 6 or more children and had never used an efficient method of contraception (67.6 per cent of the total).
Transitional (28.0 per cent of the total sample): (a) women who desired 6 or more children but had used an efficient method of contraception (8.2 per cent of the total), and (b) women who desired fewer than 6 children but had never used an efficient method (19.8 per cent).
Modern: women who desired fewer than 6 children and had used an efficient method of contraception (4.4 per cent of the total).
Modern and transitional women in general were younger, better educated, had better educated husbands, and were less likely to be in polygynous unions. As also expected, a higher proportion of urban than of rural women were in the transitional and modern categories. The proportion of women who have these characteristics is increasing rather rapidly in Kenya, and therefore presumably the proportion of women in the transitional and modern categories is also increasing although the study was unable to determine the rate of change.
During the 1960's and 1970's the total fertility rate in Kenya rose from about 6.5 to over 8.0 (Mott and Mott, 1980). This was at a time when the proportion of "modern" and "transitional" women (see above) was increasing. These two

apparently contradictory developments are consistent with the hypothesis that fertility in Africa--in this case, Kenya-- has been primarily determined, and constrained, by intermediate supply variables rather than demand variables.
Other analysts have also found strong evidence that fertility in traditional and early fertility-transition populations is determined or constrained primarily by intermediate supply variables. These studies include Henin's research among nomadic and settled agriculturalists in the Sudan (Henin, 1969), the research of Caldwell and Caldwell (1977, 1981), Dow (1977), and Orubuloye (1981) on the effects of post-partum abstinence on fertility among the Yoruba, Jejeebhoy's analysis of the Taiwan fertility decline (Jejeebhoy, 1978), research by Hull and Hull (1977) in Indonesia, research by Srinivasan, Reddy, and Raju (1978) on determinants of fertility and fertility change in southern India, and Knodel's (1978) analysis of fertility in preindustrial Germany. Knodel's (1977) reinterpretation of the determinants of marital fertility in the pre-fertilitytransition periods of European populations is also consistent with this theoretical formulation, as is Mosk's (1979) conclusion that in the pre-Meiji period in Japan desired fertility generally exceeded natural fertility.
Additional data consistent with this analysis are derived from a study of about 1,500 households in four rural areas in northeastern Tanzania. Table 1 summarizes selected socioeconomic, educational, and demographic data for these populations obtained from interviews with adult household members.
The study was carried out in four well-watered, fertile, and denselysettled rural communities; two (LI and L2) are located in Lushoto district and

two (Ml and M2) in Moshi district. At the time the data were collected (late 1973) there were about 1,000 households and 5,000 people in each of the four areas. The areas ranged in size from about 7 to 10 square kilometers with average densities of 500-700 per square kilometer, although some residents of each area also cultivated land and grazed livestock outside the area, so that the land effectively supporting these populations was somewhat larger. All four are located at elevations between 1,050 and 1,850 meters.
Based on accounts of early European travelers, Christian missionaries, European settlers, and (German) government officials (all of whom first entered these areas in the late nineteenth century), these were still traditional rural African societies as recently as the early 1900's. Almost all residents adhered to tribal religions. Formal (Western-style) schools and medical services were only beginning to be established. Very little commercialization of agriculture had taken place. Birth rates were high-- probably close to 50 per thousand--and death rates were probably not yet much below their historic average levels, perhaps 40 per thousand (with average expectations of life at birth not much above 25 years). Almost no one one had received any formal education.
However, considerable socioeconomic development and improvements in living conditions have occurred in all four areas during this century. By 1973 crude death rates had declined to about 12-15 per thousand, the expectation of life at birth was 50-55 years, and most children were receiving at least some primary education. Most residents no longer followed traditional religions, substantial numbers of households (especially in the Moshi area) resided in

50

nontraditional and relatively expensive houses, and almost all households participated in the cash economy although per capita incomes probably still did not exceed $100 per year.
These are currently rural societies in transition. They are clearly not yet "developed," but they are also no longer traditional (see Figure 1). There are also large differentials in the levels and spread of the changes, both within and among the four areas, some of which are reflected in the characteristics shown in Tables 1 and 2, e.g., formal schooling, age at first marriage, incidence of polygyny, and duration of breastfeeding. Generally, the four areas can be ranked, from the one having experienced the least change to the one having experienced the most change, as follows: LI, L2, Ml, M2. This is the case, for example, for women's education (Table 1, Col. 6 and 7).
Some of the more relevant and notable differences among the areas shown in Tables 1 and 2 are the following: In M2 age at marriage has apparently risen substantially in recent years (Table 1, Col. 9) and childbearing is now commencing at a later age (Table 1, Col. 4). Women ages 20-24 had only half as many live births in M2 as in the other three areas, while differences among women ages 25-29 were less pronounced, and M2 women ages 30-34 had slightly more live births than women in the other areas. Other notable behavioral changes presumably related to these are the dramatically declining prevalence of polygyny in M2 (Table 1, Col. 12) and to a lesser extent in Ml with apparently little change in LI and L2, and the substantial decline in the average duration of breast-feeding (Table 2, Col. 2-5). The latter may, at least in part, be the consequence of the demise

of prolonged post-partum sexual abstinence, particularly in M2 and possibly also in Ml. A recent study in Northern Nigeria found that women with some formal education practiced post-partum sexual abstinence for a shorter period than did women with no education (Rehan and Abashiya, 1981).
Respondents in the Tanzania study were questioned as to whether they thought that the usual length of breastfeeding had been changing in recent years. The predominant response was that it was declining, primarily because women were resuming sexual intercourse with their husbands sooner after childbirth and as a result having another pregnancy sooner and terminating breast-feeding sooner than had traditionally been the case. However, it was not possible to recruit female interviewers for this study, and pretesting demonstrated that direct questions concerning sexual abstinence were too sensitive for male interviewers to ask of women respondents. In the absence of data on abstinence, duration of breast-feeding may be considered a proxy (of unknown reliability) for duration of post-partum sexual abstinence. Presumably the substantial recent increase in women's educational attainment, especially in M2, is another important contributor to all these behavioral changes.
It is also interesting that perceptions of declining child mortality seem to be strongly associated with these other general differences in the extent of social change. Estimates based on model life tables indicate that female life expectancy at birth in each of the four study areas was in the 50-55 year range (Table 2, Col. 6), implying that infant and child mortality have probably fallen substantially in recent decades in all four areas (Henin et al., 1977).

respondents in both Moshi areas believe that child mortality has been declining, but in the Lushoto areas (and particularly LI) the majority believe otherwise (Cols. 8and 9). Finally, Cols. 10-12 (Table 2) show that for given numbers of surviving children, in most cases a higher proportion of Moshi respondents desired no more children than did Lushoto respondents.
These data suggest that in these study areas socioeconomic change and educational improvements are associated with rising age at first marriage and first birth, but that they are also associated with changes in certain intermediate supply variables which on balance result in shorter birth intervals.
Table 3 shows the results of a multiple regression analysis in which the dependent variable is the number of. live births (parity), while two different sets of independent variables are presented--one the so-called "supply variables" (number of years married, number of deceased children, duration of breast-feeding, polygyny) and the second, the so-called "demand variables" (proxy variables for income, wealth, relative prices, and tastes). Regression results are shown separately for women ages 20-29 and 30-39 in all four study areas combined. Both the "supply" and "demand" independent variables are only imperfect proxies for the "conceptually correct" variables discussed earlier in this paper, and regression results should therefore be viewed with considerable caution.
The supply regressions support the observations based on Tables 1 and 2 about the direction of the relationships between intermediate supply variables (as measured in this study) and fertility, and they are consistent with the model illustrated in Figure 1. Fertility is posi-

tively related to the number of deceased children (a proxy for child mortality), negatively related to duration of breastfeeding, and negatively related to polygyny except for women ages 20-29 where the relationship is trivial. All relationships except the latter are statistically significant at the 0.01 level. For women ages 30-39, the regression results indicate that the independent effect of each of these "supply" variables on fertility was the following. Each additional year of marriage resulted in an additional 0.22 births; each deceased child resulted in an additional 0.69 births; each additional month of breast-feeding resulted in 0.037 fewer births, or about 0.45 fewer births for each additional year of breast-feeding; and the independent effect of a polygynous marriage was that women in those marriages had about 0.75 fewer births than women in monogamous marriages.
On the other hand, among the socalled "demand" variables, only two independent variables show statistically significant relationships with the dependent variable (parity) among women ages 20-29, and there are no statistically significant relationships among women ages 30-39. Among the former, building quality index (as a proxy for household wealth) is positively related to fertility and women's formal education is negatively related to fertility--both as hypothesized. It is assumed here that formal education for women alters tastes and preferences in such a way that the traditional value of high fertility is diminished. In some conceptual formulations, increased formal education also increases the opportunity cost to women of having additional children, but this factor was probably not yet of much importance in these rural areas.
Although these results should be

treated with caution, they are consistent with the analysis presented earlier in this paper which concluded that in traditional and early transitional rural Africa societies, intermediate supply variables are primarily responsible for determining fertility, and ultimately child survivorship. Demand considerations have little influence and are at best only weak

reinforcers of the existing fertility disequilibria, with demand for children exceeding supply of children, as in the cases of the proxy for household wealth and education of women ages 20-29 (Table 3).

nation of fertility, it might be worth noting again that both rising age at first marriage and declining infant and young child mortality independently reduce fertility, while declining duration of breast-feeding (possibly associated with the demise of prolonged post-partum sexual abstinence) and the demise of polygyny result in shorter birth intervals which independently increase fertility. The "net" fertility effect depends on the relative magnitude of each of these individual effects. Thus, data on fertility unaccompanied by data or information on changes in these key intermediate supply variables may lead to the conclusion that relatively little fertility-affecting change is taking place in the society, while in fact the opposite is the case. The social change which is occurring may hasten--and may even be a precondition for--intentional fertility-affecting behavioral change such as the use of modern contraceptives for spacing, and eventually for the purpose of terminating childbearing.
DISCUSSION
RELEVANCE FOR MACRO-LEVEL
FERTILITY CHANGE
Much of the interest in fertility and mortality in developing countries does not extend to micro-level analyses but is limited to inspection of fertility levels and trends of population aggregates at national, state, or regional levels. Substantial fertility differences are often observed at these aggregate levels. For example, there is clear evidence of rather large fertility differentials by regions, ethnic groups, and ecological zones in Tanzania, Ghana, and Kenya (Henin et al., 1977; Gaisie and de Graft-Johnson, 1974; Faruqee, 1980).

The preceding discussion and analysis, concerned only with micro-level processes, suggests that the causal relationships which result in a given fertility level at any particular time are complex and not subject to easy illumination. The analysis further suggests that a superficial examination of current fertility levels and trends which fails to illuminate both absolute and relative changes in important intermediate fertility variables may produce misleading conclusions about fertility change prospects in the near and more distant future.
This finding has an important, simple, but often-overlooked implication concerning the relative shares of the total population in each relevant subgroup. If different subgroups of a population are undergoing different biological, cultural and socioeconomic fertility-affecting experiences, the fertility effects at the aggregate-level will be the product of fertility effects in each subgroup weighted by the relative proportions of the population found in each of the subgroups.
This process is particularly important for populations in which both intermediate supply and demand variables are undergoing change, and for those populations in which intermediate demand variables are becoming of increasing importance in affecting fertility and in which some fertility decline is occurring or is beginning. There is evidence from experiences of several developing countries, and from cross-sectional analyses of a large number of countries, consistent with the hypothesis that the rate of decline in aggregate-level fertility is related to the distribution of income and of access to education and social welfare services (Flegg, 1979; Kocher, 1973;Repetto, 1979; Rich, 1973; Ridker, 1976). That is, the relatively more equal the
