ABSTRACT: This study tests two theories accounting for observed relationships between U.S. rates of childlessness and sociodemographic characteristics using data on Black and white women aged 30-44 from the 1970 U.S. census. Traditional theory sees the observed correlations as spuriously caused by involuntary sterility, while voluntaristic theory interprets the associations as evidence of influences on the decisions of fecund couples to remain childless. We examine the two positions by estimating and then comparing the aggregate causal structures of childless rates and cumulative fertility rates of women with proven fecundity. The traditional approach expects little if any relationship, while the voluntaristic approach predicts high similarity between the two estimated structures. Results support the voluntaristic position and thus offer indirect substantiation of the voluntaristic theory of areal variation in childless rates.

tion in rates of childlessness (Nason and Paloma, 1974; Veevers, 1973; Gustavus and Henley, 1971). These "voluntaristic" theorists view relationships between rates of childlessness and sociodemographic variables as causal effects on decision processes underlying the 0-1 parity transition probability.

Recent analysts (Griffith, 1973; Namboodiri, 1972; Blake, 1968) contend that married couples are under strong normative pressure to bear at least two children. Thus, few fecund couples remain childless by choice. Sterility (as a function of age at marriage and/or physiological disorder) explains the relationships between child-

wives unable to bear children are more likely to work, thereby increasing the positive association between female labor force participation and childless rates, while Veevers (1971a) and others have related age at marriage to fecundity and childless rates. This perspective views areal correlations between childless rates and sociodemographic variables as spuriously caused by areal variation in involuntary sterility.
However, recent trends suggest that the traditional view of childlessness as largely involuntary may no longer be appropriate. For example, between 1967 and 1975, the proportion of white wives aged 18-24 saying they intend to remain childless increased from 1.3 to 4.4 per cent (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1977, Table 78). Actual childlessness among younger women has also increased steadily over the past decade (Heuser, 1976, Table 6A). Because health care and medical technology have improved, recent increases in childless rates cannot be attributed to higher rates of sterility.
Some analysts (Cutright and Polonko, 1977; Scanzoni, 1975; Griffith, 1973) have suggested that the normative pressure on young married couples to bear children is decreasing. Also, egalitarianism in familial sex roles, believed to be an important predictor of childlessness (Veevers, 1974), is increasing (Scanzoni, 1975). Of course, the recent increase in childlessness may only reflect postponement of childbearing among younger couples. However, some evidence indicates that the decision to remain childless usually follows a sequence of earlier decisions to postpone childbearing. Eventually, rewards from alternative roles available to childless couples make the costs of bearing a child prohibitive (Scanzoni and Polonko, 1975; Veevers, 1973). Thus, voluntary childlessness early in the life cycle may exert an independent effect on later fertility by altering the rela-

tive costs and rewards of subsequent childbearing.
In sum, two opposing theories account for the relationships between childless rates and a number of sociodemographic variables. The traditional perspective states that observed correlations are spuriously caused by covariation between involuntary sterility and sociodemographic indicators. In opposition, the voluntaristic position views observed relations as evidence that causal variables influence voluntary decisions to remain childless.
Whether using regression or simpler statistical models, prior work did not adequately test these alternative explanations. For example, Cutright and Polonko (1977) estimated a recursive regression model of childless rates of wives and interpreted their results within a voluntaristic costreward framework. However, their study is vulnerable to the traditional criticism that associations interpreted as evidence of voluntary choice are spuriously caused by correlations between sterility and the sociodemographic variables. For example, sterility may influence female migration, labor force participation, or other variables which then appear, in cross-section, to be causes of childlessness. Thus, while the cost-reward framework lends interpretive coherence to Cutright and Polonko's findings, nothing in their data allows a test between the voluntaristic and traditional explanations of variation in areal rates of childlessness. We now discuss the logic of an indirect test of these two opposing positions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
AN INDIRECT TEST
To the extent the couples are childless by choice, Veevers (1971c, p. 547) hypothesized that "variations in the incidence of childlessness will occur concomitantly, and in the expected direction, with varia-

tions in determinants know to affect fertility." Thus, "voluntaristic" theory predicts that childlessness is causally influenced by sociodemographic variables that also affect measures of cumulative fertility of fecund women; both influences occur through voluntary choice. However, traditional theorists may respond by stating that areal variation in involuntary sterility, by definition, should be negatively related to cumulative fertility while positively influencing childless rates. This is expected because, all else equal, areas with many childless women will also have low rates of cumulative fertility among all women.
To resolve this impasse, we estimate and compare the effects of sociodemographic indicators on childless rates and the cumulative fertility of women of proven fecundity by examining rates only among women who have borne at least one child. To the extent that variation in voluntary childlessness determines variation in the childless rate, we hypothesize that the causal structures of rates of childlessness and the cumulative fertility of fecund women should be similar and of opposite sign. A comparative analysis of these two fertility variables should reduce the criticism that causal similarity is spuriously caused by involuntary sterility. However, the test is not definitive in that only the voluntaristic position may be disproved directly. For certain variables, such as labor force participation, causal similarity could still reflect spurious influences of sterility. We now discuss the rationale for using aggregate data to test this hypothesis.
THE USE OF AGGREGATE DATA
Individual-level studies comparing the fertility of childless women and mothers are hard pressed (1) to match adequately the two samples, (2) to include measures of community health care and the availabil-

ity of comparable birth control methods, and (3) to measure the effect of female labor force opportunity. Individual-level studies usually do not estimate the effect of female labor force opportunity on the fertility of women who are not employed because "among individual households the wage rate of wives is either unknown (for the approximately two-thirds of wives who are not working) or is likely to be highly endogenous" (Cain and Weininger, 1973, p. 208). This so-called "shadowprice" of a woman's time, as estimated by the actual female labor force rate, should be important in studies of childlessness because the opportunity costs of a first child may be greater than those of succeeding births.
By using aggregate data, the effect of the female labor force participation rate includes the influence of the employment opportunity structure on both the fertility of women who are employed and those not in the labor force. Thus, aggregate analysis allows an assessment of the impact on fertility of areal differences in the female opportunity structure. Further, grouped data suppresses variation in individual tastes for children and reduces effects of measurement error in both endogenous and exogenous variables. By using large areas, we assume that measurement error and child preferences are normally distributed and therefore have an expected value of zero within each area (Cain and Weininger, 1973). However, if variation in tastes or measurement error is related to the grouping procedure through selective migration or inaccurate data collection, this assumption is invalid. In sum, areal data improves our ability to compare the determinants of rates of childlessness with those determinants of cumulative fertility rates in the fecund population.
We caution that estimated parameters cannot be interpreted as individual-level effects (Hannan and Burstein, 1974).

The mean rate for children ever born to the white birth cohort of 1926 for exact ages 31-45 is 2,702, or 92.6 per cent of the final rate of 2,917 by exact age 45 (Heuser, 1976, Table 6B).
INDEPENDENT VARIABLES
After defining each independent variable, we include a rationale for expecting the variable to affect childlessness. We omit parallel explanations for expecting the opposite effect on CEBM.
Population density is the natural logarithm of 1970 total population in the counties that make up a SAU, divided by square miles. Increases in density should increase rates of childlessness (Grabill and Glick, 1959; Veevers, 197la,¿>) because density is positively related to the cost of bearing and raising children (Rainwater, 1973) and to the availability of alternative roles for women that encourage childlessness. Across both white and Black SAU's, population density is positively related (r = 0.64) to the percentage of women in urban areas and fits rates of childlessness slightly better than does the percentage of women living in urban areas.
Southern residence is important because Southern whites are more likely than whites outside the South to postpone first births, whether before or after marriage (Freshnock and Cutright, unpublished, 1978a, Tables 3 and 4). This regional difference may affect rates of childlessness for older white women. We included region in analyses of Blacks to test whether the traditionally low childlessness and high cumulative fertility of Southern Blacks (Farley, 1970, Chap. 4) persisted in 1970. This variable is coded 1 for SAU's in the South and 0 for all others.
Low education in an age-race subgroup is measured by the number of women per 1,000 with less than eight completed years of school. We expect low education to be

negatively related to childlessness and positively related to CEBM because women with little education have fewer alternatives to childbearing than do women with more education (Grabill and Glick, 1959) and less effective control over fertility (Ryder, 1973).
Education is measured in this way because (1) a "common level of birth control information may exist throughout the middle and upper ranges of the educational strata. Thus, variation in percentages of the least educated group may explain more of the variation in fertility" (Cain and Weininger, 1973, p. 210) and (2) recent research (Rao, 1974, Table 3) indicates that by educational level, the per cent of women childless differs only between those completing Grades 1-8 and those with more than eight years of education.
Migration is the number of women per 1,000 in an age-race subgroup who in 1965 resided outside the county of residence in 1970. High rates of migration may be related to economic opportunities for unmarried women as well as for wives and their husbands. Also, childless couples and those with small families may be more likely to migrate than other couples. Thus, high rates of migration should be positively related to rates of childlessness.
Physician density in each SAU is measured by the number of primary-care doctors and chiropractors per 1,000 women aged 15-44. Interns, residents, fellows, and physicians primarily concerned with teaching or research are omitted (Office of Economic Opportunity, 1972, p. 298). The measure is not race specific; it indicates availability of general medical care to women of reproductive age. If the density of physicians increases access to physician-controlled contraceptive or other birth control services, then net of other factors, the more physicians, the more likely that women who want to re-

education, program enrollment, and number of physicians are also significant, but of lesser importance, and migration is of borderline significance. All eight variables have expected effects on Black childless rates.

while decreasing children per 1,000 mothers; labor force participation increases childlessness among Black women while decreasing CEBM, and low education decreases childlessness and increases CEBM. We take these findings as further evidence that the relationship of independent variables to rates of childlessness is not the result of concomitant areal variation in involuntary sterility. The socioeconomic determinants of CEBM also affect rates of childlessness.

The results of nonrecursive regression analyses of childlessness, when compared to analyses of fertility among women of proven fecundity, suggest that areal variation in rates of childlessness among older American women in 1970 is highly structured. Fifteen of 16 variables show significant effects on the number of children per mother {p =£ 0.10). Of these IS variables, 13 were also significantly related to childlessness in the opposite direction, as hypothesized by the voluntaristic theory.

Comparing coefficients for Black and white women, the effect of one variable, Southern residence, shows a marked interaction with race. Sly (1970) reported a similar interaction. For Blacks, the
