The relationship between fecundity (the biological capacity for reproduction) and fertility has been neglected in population research. Several studies have focused upon a component of fecundity, fecundability, usually defined as the monthly probability of conception (Jain, 1969a, 19696; Potter and Sakoda, 1967; James, 1963; Tietze, 1959). Others have attempted to identify the fecund segments of a population (Badenhorst and Higgens, 1962; Whelpton, Campbell, Patterson, 1966). However, only one study (Harter, 1970), conducted in the United States, has attempted to answer the fundamental question, "What is the effect of fecundity upon the fertility of a population?" This question is basic to all fertility research since the level of fecundity obviously places limits on the actual reproductive performance of a population.
The objectives of the present investigation are, first, to assess the level of fecundity and its variation between selected segments of a population and, second, to
* Since the research presented here was completed before the independence of Bangladesh, we have maintained throughout this paper the designations of areas and agencies as they were at the time of the investigation.

assess the effect of fecundity upon agespecific birth rates, total fertility rates, and estimates of completed family size.
The investigation was conducted under the auspices of the Pakistan-SEATO Cholera Research Laboratory (P-SCRL) on a rural population located in Matlab thana (an area of approximately a hundred square miles) in the south central portion of East Pakistan. The P-SCRL was established in 1960 to develop, improve, and demonstrate measures for the prevention and eventual eradication of cholera. A major component of the program is the conduct of controlled field trials of cholera vaccines. The basic design of these field trials involves taking a complete census in the area under study and assigning an identifying census number to every individual. The vaccines to be tested are randomly assigned to the population and administered by vaccine teams. In order to detect all cholera cases, field workers visit every household daily to make inquiries about the occurrence of acute diarrheal illnesses. Since 1963 the population under study has been expanded from 28,000 (23 villages) to 225,000 (243 villages). From 1966 to the present, the field staff has maintained a regular registration

of all births, deaths, and migrations in addition to conducting their regular surveillance for actual diarrheal diseases.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Data on fecundity were obtained by interviewing all ever-married women in 132 villages of Matlab thana in January and February, 1968. Forty field assistants conducted the interviews on 30,155 evermarried women of all ages. These same assistants had conducted a census of all the households in the same villages in 1966. The census data together with the registration of all new persons in the area provided the information needed to identify all of the ever-married women in each household.
Two fecundity status groups were defined: (1) fecund--women who had given birth during the year or had been pregnant and those currently pregnant, lactating, experiencing post-partum amenorrhea, or "regularly" menstruating. "Regularly" menstruating was defined as a woman who had menstruated for six or more months in the year; (2) subfecund--women who were definitely sterile due to operation or disease, had reached menopause, had not attained menarche, or who menstruated "irregularly." "Irregular" menstruation was defined as the absence of menstruation during the last six months of the year without pregnancy.
Six months was designated as the criterion for "regularity" of menstruation for the following reasons. It was assumed that women who had not menstruated for a shorter period within the six month interval could still be fecund since they may be pregnant and not know it or could have been pregnant and aborted and were experiencing amenorrhea at the time of interview. In addition, a six-month interval allowed for women in the older age groups who were just reaching menopause

during mid-year to be counted as subfecund and girls who were attaining menarche at mid-year to be counted as fecund.
Admittedly this classification scheme can provide only a rough estimate of fecundity and its shortcomings should be made clear. First, this definition is intended to yield an estimate of the fecundity status in the previous year so that its effect upon the fertility of the present year can be assessed. Hence, the major assumption is that the fecundity of 30,155" evermarried women in the year under study would not have altered significantly from the previous year. It should be noted, however, that the part of the estimate this affects most specifically is the category defined by "regularity" of menstruation.
Second, the scheme does not measure couple fecundity, but only female fecundity. Hence, husbands who are sterile are not included. This produces an overestimation of actual reproductive capacity when a fecund woman has a sterile husband. In the present situation, however, this effect is assumed to be minimal since preliminary survey results have indicated that fewer than 1% of the males in the area were sterilized (Ahmad, 1970).
Third, women classed as "regularly" menstruating may have fecundity impairments due to physical disorders which are not reflected by irregular menstruation, e.g., endometriosis1. This could result in overestimating the number of fecund women, particularly in age groups where such disorders are more prevalent. The medical examinations required to diagnose these disorders are beyond the scope of the present investigation.
Finally, those women who have had a "relatively" long interval since last birth or a history of high fetal wastage are not identified and could still be considered
1 Endometriosis is an intrauterine condition associated with subfecundity.

fecund under the present definition. Although such women may still be fecundable, their inclusion in the fecund segment could tend to overestimate actual reproductive capacity. In the classification of fecundity used in the Growth of American Families (GAF) study (Whelpton, Campbell, Patterson, 1966) and in a South African study (Badenhorst and Higgens, 1962) such women were categorized as "probably sterile" and "semi-fecund," respectively, and not included as fecund. It is possible that a portion of these women were included as subfecund in the present study because some may menstruate irregularly. However, in sum, it would appear that the present definition of fecundity generally tends to overestimate actual female reproductive capacity.
The data for births used in the calculation of fertility rates were obtained from the birth reports for all births registered in the area for the period January 1 to December 31, 1967. Collection of these data involves the following. A local female resident (field worker) of each village visits each household daily to check for any births (or deaths). Her work and record keeping is supervised by male field assistants. (Each field assistant has from 3 to 5 field workers under supervision.) These assistants visit each family an average of once weekly to record the vital events on standard forms which are checked against the information collected by the female resident. Supervision of the work of the field assistant is conducted by sanitary inspectors who visit each household twice a month to check on the completeness of the registration. These workers in turn are supervised by the field surveillance supervisor and his deputy who are responsible for the coordination of the field work.
Record linkage with the interview data was used to match the registered births

with their mothers. Of the 5,151 births recorded for the year, 96% were matched. The remaining 4% were not matched due to the temporary or permanent out-migration or death of the mother.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
As shown in Table 1, slightly over 70% of all ever-married women were fecund. Their fecundity, as would be expected, exhibits a close association with age. The proportion fecund is relatively low in the age group 10-14 and rises abruptly in the 15-19 group where the level of 96-99% is maintained through ages 25-29. From this point on, however, the proportion fecund exhibits a steady decline through the remaining portion of the age structure.
Table 1 also provides the basis for a comparison of levels of fecundity between various marital statuses. First, the proportions fecund for "divorced or separated" women are slightly lower throughout the age structure than the proportions fecund for women "living with husband." A possible explanation for this finding for the age structure 15 years and older is that one of the reasons for divorce and separation in this society is the inability of a wife to bear children. Hence, this could operate as a selective factor to increase the proportion of subfecund among the divorced or separated women. In the youngest portion of the age structure, 10-14 years, the "separated" group may include premenarchal girls who have been contracted for marriage but as yet the marriage has not been consummated. This would also tend to reduce the proportion fecund.
Secondly, the proportions fecund among "widowed" women are consistently lower throughout the age structure (with differences as great as 16 and 12 points in the age groups 40-44 and 20-24 years, respectively) than the proportions fecund

among women "living with husband." This could be due to the tendency of widowed women (Muslim) to underreport their age to increase the possibility of remarriage. If this occurred throughout the age structure, then widowed women of a given age group would actually be older than women within the group who are living with their husbands. Since fecundity is related to age, the result would be as indicated: lower proportions fecund among "widowed" than among women "living with husband."
Another factor which may contribute to this difference is widow remarriage. Perhaps those widows who have already remarried represent a more fecund group, since a factor which aids remarriage could be past performance in childbearing. That is, a "young widow" who has demonstrated her ability to bear children would be more desirable than a widow who hasn't. This would reduce the proportions fecund among those widows who remain unmarried.
A final explanation centers around the age differential between the deceased husband and the widow. As would be expected, widowed women had husbands who were, on the average, older than husbands of currently married women. A reason for this difference could be that something was initially wrong with the woman which made her undesirable for marriage. In this society, where arranged marriage is the norm, these women may have been married to the last possible alternative, a man older than usually desired by the family. Further, if the undesirability was related to potential inability to bear children (e.g., irregularity of menstruation) this could result in a higher proportion of widows who are subfecund.
The relationship between fecundity, age, and number of living children is presented in Table 2 for women living with hus-

bands.2 The results indicate that among younger women (15-29 years old), the proportion fecund shows little or no variation with number of living children. A slight variation occurs in this pattern in the following age group, 30-34, where the proportion fecund for women who are childless is almost 8 points lower than the proportion fecund for women who have one or more living children.
A distinctive break with previous patterns occurs in the next two age groups. At ages 35-39, the proportion fecund increased between no living children and 2-4, then increased again for women with 5 or more living children. The relationship at ages 40-44 illustrates the pattern suggested in the previous group with a direct association between the proportion fecund and the number of living children. This pattern is not as evident in the 45-49 year group where there is a decrease in the proportion fecund between women who are childless and those with 1 or 2 living children. However, the proportion does increase from this point on, with the 4-6 living children group having about equal proportions and the 7 + living children group showing the highest proportion. Generally, in the remaining age group, 50 years and older, the proportion fecund shows little variation with number of living children.
These results seem to indicate that the primary factor influencing fecundity for those women below 35 years is age. However, women with larger families generally have higher proportions fecund than those with smaller families.
Table 3 illustrates the results of calculating age-specific and total fertility rates for all women living with husband and
2 The relationship between fecundity of "widowed" and "divorced or separated" women with number of living children and age is not presented since the number in the two groups is too small for cross-tabulation.

for the portion of those women who are fecund. The findings indicate that subfecundity operates to reduce the total fertility rate by about 0.8 births per woman. Between the ages of IS and 34 the reduction is rather small. The major reductions occur in the age groups 10-14 and 35-49 where subfecundity is high. Since subfecundity is lowest in the age groups making the greatest contribution to total fertility, its overall impact is minimized. Hence, in the absence of contraception, subfecundity could not be expected to reduce total fertility beyond one birth per woman, assuming that the women reproduced throughout their childbearing period according to the current fertility schedule.

Another important aspect of the effect of fecundity upon fertility is the impact that current family size has upon this relationship. As seen in Table 4, the reduction in total fertility due to subfecundity begins at a low of 0.2 births for childless women and increases to 0.4 births for women with 2 or 3 living children. The

largest reduction occurs for women with 4 living children at 0.9, then drops to 0.6 and O.S, respectively, for women with 5 to 6 and 7-f- children. Thus, the major impact of subfecundity upon fertility occurs in the larger family sizes. However, it should be pointed out that the differences in fertility rates with the exception of women with 4 children are generally small.
Table 5 provides another estimate of completed family size for women "living with husband" and for the portion of those women who are fecund which takes into account the mortality conditions omitted in the total fertility rate. If the rates of infant and childhood mortality which would occur to the children as they aged to the end of the mothers reproductive period are applied (life-table technique), the expected completed family size of fecund women (holding female mortality constant) is slightly over 6 children as compared to about 5.5 children for all women "living with husband".
Including the female mortality which would occur to the women as they aged to the completion of childbearing, as well as the mortality conditions for births, yields a completed family size of almost 7 surviving children for each surviving fecund woman and slightly over 6 children for all women "living with husband". Obviously these results are also hypothetical since the mortality conditions applied refer to current rates. However, the measure does provide a more realistic estimate of potential completed family size than the total fertility rate.
SUMMARY
An analysis of fecundity and its effect upon fertility in a rural area of East Pakistan in 1968 indicates that of 30,155 ever-married women over two-thirds were fecund. Their fecundity varied inversely with age, with the exception of the young-

(JV = 592) who are fecund show a similar relation with age, but their proportions fecund are generally lower than those for married women "living with husbands".
Fecundity of women "living with husbands" was also related to total number of living children; that is, those women with larger families had higher proportions fecund than those with smaller families. This relationship was most apparent in the older age groups.
The effect of subfecundity on the total fertility rate was found to account for a reduction of about 0.8 births. The major reduction in age-specific fertility due to subfecundity occurred in the age groups making the lowest contribution to total fertility. In addition, an estimate of completed family size taking into account the mortality which would occur to all births and women indicated that irrespective of subfecundity, if current fertility and mortality conditions persisted, completed family sizes would be of the order of 6 surviving children per surviving woman.
