ABSTRACT: On the basis of face photographs, a team of 50 male judges assessed the physical attractiveness of 64 young women, giving them scores according to two scales (0/1 and 1-10). The attractiveness of each woman was then calculated as the mean value of assessments of all observers. The ratio of intra- to interpersonal variance of assessments was the measure of divergence of the observers' opinions (and its complement to unit was the measure of consistency). The correlation between assessments of attractiveness and measurements of the morphological features of the women was calculated as well as the correlation between the morphological features of the observers and the features of women regarded by them as the most attractive. The main conclusions are: Attractiveness is not solely a function of individual tastes. About 25 per cent of the assessments' variance can be explained by common opinion of the judges. Higher assessments of attractiveness are correlated with modal variants of morphological features of assessed women. There was no correlation between morphological features of the observers and the features of the women rated most attractive by those observers.

Physical attractiveness is a concept which, both in common language and in psychology, is used as if it referred to some objective morphological feature (Aronson, 1972; Murstein, 1972; Berscheid and Walster, 1974; Mika, 1981; Light et al., 1981; Rostowski, 1987). Admittedly this feature is a complex one; yet it shows a normal variability, and its variants can be compared to an "attractiveness scale." There arises the question of whether representatives of one population agree in their assessments of attractiveness. Another question which has not been fully answered is that of the origin of the constituents of attractiveness, and their relationship to the genetic make-up of the individual. An attempt to answer this question can be found in the paper by Langlois and Roggman (1990).
Physical attractiveness undoubtedly influences the formation of social rela-

tionships. However, cultural factors also strongly influence the selection of social partners among contemporary humans in the majority of cases. It is likely that the influence of these factors in the early stages of hominid evolution was less significant, and the contribution of physical attractiveness to general or overall attractiveness was substantial. To what degree and in what way the human morphological features determined by genes have in the past influenced the creation of social ties cannot be directly determined now. However, one can assume that the mechanism of mutual human "morphological attraction," if it had been fixed formerly in the genotypes, can be detected.
For the purposes of this paper, physical attractiveness will be taken to be a configuration of visible morphological features of the human body evoking in

the observer a "positive" attitude to the person who has the specified features. In other words, they engender in the observer a desire or at least a consent to come into contact with the person seen. Attractiveness understood in this way is undoubtedly a variable in the statistical sense. Furthermore, let us assume that the dimensions and proportions of the face are among the traits the configuration of which determines attractiveness. The "null" hypotheses we have formulated are:
1. Physical attractiveness is solely a function of the individual tastes of the observer, i.e., no consistency in the assessments made by a group of persons can be expected. Alternatively, there is some consistency between the assessors for at least some components of attractiveness.
2. Morphological features (in themselves) have no influence on the assessment of attractiveness (subject to the condition that they do not represent any pathological or extreme variants in the distribution of variability). Alternatively, the estimation of attractiveness depends on the occurrence in the person being assessed of some particular variants of morphological features.
If we reject hypothesis 2, we can advance the following "null" hypotheses:
3. Variants of features which determine a high attractiveness rating are particular variants in the sense that they occur less frequently than others. Alternatively, physical attractiveness is connected with the average variants of the features.
4. The assessment of attractiveness does not depend on the morphology of the observer. If not, then the assessment of attractiveness depends on the

variants of morphological features which are represented by the observer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The material on which the assessments of attractiveness were performed consisted of the black-andwhite photographs of 64 Polish women--students of Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznan--aged 20-23 years. The photographs (full face) were made under standard conditions by artificial lighting and were magnified to the size of 13 x 18 cm. Anthropometric measurements of the head were carried out on each of the photographed women. The attractiveness of the women was assessed by 50 male judges (Polish university students and graduates) aged 20-40 years on whom the same anthropometric measurements were performed. The persons rated for physical attractiveness were strangers to the judges.
The group of judges examined the photographs four times. The assessments were carried out in two ways on the basis of each of two criteria. The assessments using the second criterion were performed at least two months after the first set of assessments.
Criterion 1 (social): Attractiveness taken to be facial features allowing the person to be defined as "attractive."
A. Estimation scale: yes-1, no-0. B. Point estimation scale: 1-10. Criterion 2 (erotic): Attractiveness as facial features permitting acceptance of the person as a possible sexual partner. A. Estimation scale: yes-1, no-0. B. Point estimation scale: 1-10 The unitary attractiveness quota of each of the women was characterized

by four numerical values: the mean values of the marks given by 50 judges using the two criteria and the two types of scoring. The mean values for each person on the point estimation scale: 0 (unattractive) and 1 (attractive) were calculated as fractions (p) of estimations " 1 . " The intrapersonal variance of these estimations can be expressed as p(l-p)- In the case of the point estimation in the scale 1-10, the mean values for the individual and the intrapersonal variance were calculated in the same way as for random variables. The averaged individual estimations gave the mean values for groups. In case of 0/1 estimations, these mean values are at the same time fractions of estimations " 1 "among all estimations given by the judges (p). General variances of the estimations of attractiveness were calculated in the following way: for point estimation 0/1, as p(l-p); for point estimation in 1-10 scale, as variance of all estimations of all judges.
The ratio of the averaged intraindividual variance to the total variance has been called the "divergence index" of the estimations by the judges. The ratio is "0" when the mean intra-individual variance is zero, and it is " 1 " when the intra-individual variability of the estimations equals the total variability. However, in the discussion of results we use the "consistency index" which is the complement to unit of the divergence index: consistency index = 1 - divergence index.
The correlation of the estimations given to the particular persons with the application of different criteria and point estimations has been calculated with the help of chi-square statistics (X2) from four-fold tables with allowed correlation coefficients

to be obtained. Due to a strong asymmetry of the distribution of "attractiveness," the correlations of the values of morphological features of particular persons with the estimations of their attractiveness were calculated as x2 from tables 2 x 3 . The values of the features have been divided into three categories.
The correlations of the values of the morphological features of the judges with those of the persons regarded by them as the most attractive (determined on the basis of combined estimations from both criteria and both types of point estimation) were calculated as Pearson's r-coefficients.
In order to investigate whether the assessments given by particular judges were connected with definite variants of morphological features in the persons assessed by them, we have calculated the "integration indices" of the judges' observations. For this purpose we have calculated the variances of the morphological features of the persons defined by each judge as attractive (marked " 1 "according to the first criterion). The 50 variances obtained for each feature (one variance from each of 50 judges) have been averaged and the ratio of this averaged "variance of attractiveness" to the general variance of the feature was calculated. The value of this ratio (estimation integration index) theoretically could be zero if the persons selected by all of the judges as being attractive showed no variability in the given feature.

criteria and scales, as well as the indices of consistency. It is worth noting the low level of attractiveness as assessed by the judges: 0.1 to 0.2 for the 0/1 scale, and about 3.3 for the 1-10 scale. The indices of estimation consistency are 0.15-0.28, which means that, on average, about 25 per cent of the variance of the assessments can be regarded as a common opinion of the judges concerning the attractiveness of the persons in the photographs.
Table 2 shows the correlation between the assessments of attractiveness made using the different criteria and scales. As can be seen, these correlations are very distinct ones. The results presented in Table 3 refer to the correlations between attractiveness and the values of the morphological features of the face. The data in this table give information on the relation between the bizygomatic breadth, the thickness of lips, the mouth index, and height-breadth facial index on the one

hand, and estimation of attractiveness on the other hand. It must be explained that, except for the bizygomatic breadth, the above-mentioned features showed an excessive frequency (using table 2 x 3 ) corresponding to the cooccurrence of mean values of the feature in connection with high attractiveness, and low and high values of feature in connection with low attractiveness.
Also noteworthy is the comparison of the arithmetic mean values of the features in the "attractive" and "unattractive" groups (the division into the two groups was made arbitrarily so as to ensure that both groups were similarly represented). Except for the bizygomatic breadth, these groups do not show any significant mean differences. On the other hand, an increased variance of some features (height of face, nose, width of mouth, thickness of lips) in the group of "unattractive" persons is observed. These results support the hypothesis that the group of "attractive" women is characterized by features with values in the middle of their distribution. These conclusions seem to be negated by a significant difference shown by the face width. The relationship between higher attractiveness and a narrow face could follow from the fact that the investigated group of women had a comparatively high mean value of this feature (Gorny, 1972; Szczotkowa, 1985). (This does not refer, however, to the relative width, i.e., the facial index.)
The search for relationships between the values of features of the judges, on the one hand, and the persons regarded by them as the most attractive, on the other, did not yield positive results. For each of the fea-

tures the correlation coefficient was so low that the hypothesis of no relationship cannot be rejected even at the 5 per cent level.
Interesting results are contained in Table 4. It shows the "integration indices" of the assessments made by the judges in reference to the morphological features. Distinctly smaller variances among the persons selected as "attractive" in comparison with the general variances have been found in the features referred to above as showing a relation with attractiveness, i.e., dimensions and indices of the mouth, nose, and the general outline of the face.

However, it probably does not depend on the variants of the morphological features found in the judges. These features, however, inelude only the morphological features found in the judges. These features, however, include only the morphological features of the face considered in this study, which are rather closely connected with the perceptible physionomical characteristics,
The idea that facial beauty is connected with the population average was previously suggested by Symons

The results presented above suggest that at least part of the attractiveness assessments is shared by many judges, These assessments, in other words, can be regarded as agreeable or "objec-

(1979). On the basis of our study it seems reasonable to affirm that physical attractiveness shows a relationship with definite configurations of morphological features of the face, and inparticular with their modal variants.

the most "typical" persons. The last statement follows from the rejection of the hypothesis that observers give higher assessments of attractiveness to persons representing variants of the features from the extreme ends of the variability ranges. Our results are in full accordance with those presented by Langlois and Roggman (1990), even though the method they applied was an entirely different one.
The consequences of the presented results are interesting from the point of view of biology. If we ignore the problem of assortative mating and its influence on the gene pool (Spuhler, 1968), then we can consider the possible occurrence of a relationship between the gene pool and social behavior in the perspective of kin selection theory. This theory (Hamilton, 1964), as well as the subsequent sociobiological literature accounting for the evolution of

altruism by way of natural selection, assumes the possibility of the recognition of kinship. In addition, this recognition must be precise so that individuals can differentiate the intensity of some types of behaviors according to the proportion of common genes. The presented results do not negate such a possibility. However, they cast doubt on whether the intensity of the social interaction can be so precisely differentiated on the basis of phenotypical features only.
Attractiveness in the psychological sense means of course significantly more than preferences for persons with certain morphological features. However, even when we limit our considerations to the influence of these features on the interaction between people, we must remember that the selection of social partners does not consist only in the mating of pairs for reproductive (or more generally erotic) purposes. After all, even in the case of mating systems, different behavior strategies for both sexes have been suggested (Bielicki, 1984).
The results presented in this paper must be supplemented by studies estimating the physical attractiveness of persons of the same sex, as well as by assessments made by women on men. Also, it is worth investigating the ontogenetic aspects of this problem (Skrzipek, 1978; and 1981). Some preferences for visual morphological features are formed during ontogenesis. The preferences depend (at least in part) on the morphological make-up of persons surrounding the developing child. Investigations of this problem can extend our knowledge about the biological sources of the social behavior of humans.
