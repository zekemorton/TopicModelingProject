Since 1948, when Monge first described historical accounts of the low fertility of Spanish colonists living at high altitude in the Andes, physiologists have collected a large body of evidence to support the contention that there is a functional relationship between hypoxia and reduced fertility. Much of this evidence is summarized in Monge (1948), Weihe (1964), McClung (1969), Clegg and Harrison (1971), and Baker and Dutt (1972). Demographers too have shown that fertility is inversely related to altitude of residence (James, 1966; Heer, 1967); but at the level of population analysis it has yet to be shown that this reduction in fertility at high altitude is the direct result of hypoxia.
The aim of this paper is to examine the relationship between hypoxia and the reduced fertility of high Andean populations.
ALTITUDE AND FERTILITY
The main sources of data used in the study of fertility in the Andean countries have been national censuses. For Peru the measure 'of fertility has been the number of children ever born, and for Ecuador and Bolivia the child/woman ratio has been used. Using census data for Peru, 1940, Stycos (1963) suggested that fertility dif-

ferences resulted because mating practices differed between Indian and Spanish language speakers. Heer (1964) has also viewed fertility differences in the Andean countries as related to differences between Indian and Spanish language speakers. However, Heer suggested that the main reasons for lower fertility among the Indian speakers were the result of a higher proportion of women in the female labor force, and a low adult sex ratio. The low adult sex ratio would result in fewer females acquiring mates. The relationship between altitude and fertility was demonstrated by James (1966), who found that this variable was a more powerful explanation of differences in fertility than any other variable. James suggested that the hypoxic effect of high altitude resulted in reduced fertility. When Heer (1967) reanalyzed the data, he agreed with James that fertility depended most on altitude in Peru, but not in Ecuador or Bolivia.
Alternative considerations have been introduced by Whitehead (1968) and Bradshaw (1969). Whitehead suggested that the reason for lower measures of fertility at high altitude was that infant mortality, particularly in the rural areas, was greater. Infant deaths would not be included in a

measure of fertility such as the child/ woman ratio. This argument is supported by the evidence of Grahn and Kratchman (1963) in the United States, Mazess (1965) in Peru, and Cruz Coke et al. (1966) in Chile. But these authors suggest that the higher level of infant mortality is the result of hypoxia. Bradshaw (1969) argued that in areas where fertility was reported to be lowest the populations were least acculturated. In these areas it would be more likely that births would be underreported, and the number of children underenumerated.
Since the census data used in the above studies do not allow more detailed analysis, De Jong (1970) and Baker and Dutt (1972) have advocated the study of individual women in communities. The use of reproductive life histories together with socioeconomic and cultural data would allow a more complete examination of factors affecting fertility. Some studies of this nature have been carried out. Hoff (1968) investigated the fertility of women living at 4,000 meters of altitude at Nufioa in Peru, and Cruz Coke (1967) studied subjects living at 3,000 meters of altitude at Huallatire, in Chile. Completed fertility for Nufioa women was 6.7, and for Huallatire, 7.3. By world standards, the fertility of these populations is high, but greater reproductive performance has been measured in low altitude populations. Among the Hutterites, completed fertility is 10.6 (Eaton and Mayer, 1953), and among an Eskimo population, 10.5 (Milan, 1970).
Apart from the overall level of fertility, the high Andean populations may be distinct from those at low altitude in several aspects of reproduction. Cruz Coke (1967) found that at Huallatire subjects were most fertile late in their reproductive life, in the fourth decade of life. Baker and Dutt (1972) also note that among women of completed fertility at Nufioa more off-

spring were born to second or subsequent spouses than to first unions. Whether these phenomena are related and if they result from the effects of biological or cultural factors is uncertain.
In the studies of Hoff (1968), Cruz Coke (1967), and Buck et al. (1968), a very low incidence of abortions was reported among high Andean populations. This may simply be the result of underreporting, or a possibility that Clegg et al. (1970) suggest is that spontaneous abortion at high altitude occurs too early in pregnancy to be recognized as such.
Thirdly, for Nufioa, Hoff (1968) reported a very high secondary sex ratio of 124. This was based on 608 births recorded during a reproductive life history survey of 136 women. Using vital statistics data over a 25-year period in the district of Nufioa, Baker and Dutt (1972) found a secondary sex ratio of 110.9 from 5,111 registered births. At the present, the significance of these findings is not clear, but this may be another difference in the process of reproduction at high altitude.
This brief review outlines some differences that have been reported with respect to the reproductive performance of high Andean populations. The interpretation of these differences and the reasons for them remain open to debate. Since it still remains impossible to directly assess the potential effect of the Andean altitudes upon the fertility of either the upward migrant or the native resident, we will in this study explore a different indirect method of determining whether altitude affects the fertility of the high altitude native.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND OBJECTIVES
Fertility may be regarded as a phenotypic characteristic of a population, and as such fertility may be modified by the effects of the physical environment. A research design that would illustrate the

effects of a high altitude environment on phenotypic characteristics has been constructed by Harrison (1966). In this research design, environmental effects are illustrated by the comparison of nonmigrants resident at high and low altitudes and with migrants between these altitudes.
A limitation of this design is that the further variable of migration is introduced. While the results of studies investigating the effect of migration on fertility are by no means uniform, sufficient data exist to suggest that the effect of migration on fertility should be taken into account. Among studies in Latin America, Hutchinson (1961) and Iutaka et al. (1971) have shown that the fertility of rural-to-urban migrants in Brazil is greater than the fertility of urban nonmigrants. However, in these studies, the effect of migration is confounded by the effect of differences in residence background. Where the residence background of migrants and nonmigrants was similar, within the standard metropolitan statistical area of San Juan, Puerto Rico, Myers and Morris (1966) and Macisco et al. (1969) found lower fertility among the migrants. The differences in the results of the studies may be explained by the effects of residence background; but at the same time the effect of migration on fertility remains unclear. Therefore, it is not possible to describe the role of migration in changing rates of fertility. At the same time, it is clear that it is necessary to control for its possible effects.
The purpose of this study is to isolate the effects of hypoxia on fertility, using a research design similar to that of Harrison (1966). The fertility rates of nonmigrants resident at high and low altitude in the Andes are compared, and also the fertility of downward migrants from high to low altitude. The effects of migration are controlled by measuring the effect of migration

on the fertility of migrants from one residence to another at the same altitude.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
DESIGN OF THE STUDY
Factors which may affect fertility in the Andes include socioeconomic conditions, cultural practices, and hypoxia. Socioeconomic conditions and cultural practices vary both at high and low altitude; the effects of these factors may therefore be examined by the analysis of data collected from nonmigrant populations. By contrast, the effect of hypoxia will not differ among the members of a population resident at a particular altitude. To illustrate the effect of this variable on fertility, it is necessary to measure the fertility of subjects exposed to the stress of hypoxia, and the fertility of the same subjects, in the absence of the stress of hypoxia. This requires that the fertility of migrants from one altitude of residence to another be measured.
In the Andes, there is a substantial volume of migration from high to low altitude; thus the effect of the removal of the stress of hypoxia can be measured. In Peru, there is also migration from one residence at low altitude to another at low altitude. This affords the opportunity to control for the effects of migration on fertility. The populations in the Andes which may therefore be used for comparative purposes are as follows:
A. Nonmigrants, resident at low altitude.
B. Nonmigrants, resident at high altitude.
C. Migrants, born at high altitude, exposed to the risk of pregnancy, before they migrate.
D. Migrants, born at high altitude, exposed to the risk of pregnancy, after migration to low altitude.
E. Migrants, born at low altitude,

SUBJECTS, SAMPLES, AND MEASURES OP FERTILITY

of birthplace of each subject and to distinguish the reproductive experience of each subject before and after migration. Because of the known relationships between altitude and oxygen transport mechanisms in man, high altitude has been defined as above 3,000 meters; women were defined as migrants if they were born outside the Tambo Valley. The age at migration was defined as the age at which a subject first changed her place of residence.
On the basis of these definitions of high altitude and migration, the fertility of populations A, C, D, E, and F, described in the design of the study, may be measured. The comparisons of the fertility of these populations and of nonmigrant high altitude populations (B), described by Hoff (1968) and Cruz Coke (1967), fulfill the conditions of the experimental design described.
The measure of fertility used for comparison was the number of children born in a five-year age interval. For a subject to contribute an observation to any age group she must have completed all five years with the same migrant status. Because the ages of the subjects at the time of migration and at the time of the survey

did not always coincide with the five-year age intervals, some information had to be discarded. However, the use of five-year age intervals decreases the chance of misclassifying the age of the subject at the birth of each child.
RESULTS
GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF FERTILITY CHARACTERISTICS AND MATING PRACTICES
The total sample consisted of 241 subjects, of whom 63 were nonmigrants born in the Tambo Valley, 57 were migrants to the valley born at high altitude. The mean ages of these subjects at the time of the survey, and at vital events during their reproductive lives, are given in Table 1. Those born at low altitude were on the average somewhat older than those born at high altitude. However, with respect to their ages at vital events during reproductive life the three groups show similar characteristics. For the migrants, the mean age at migration occurred near the age of 20 years. For this reason, only limited data are available on the fertility of these subjects before migration. With respect to the age reported for first pregnancy, the mean

values of all three populations were less than 0.65 years apart. Age at first live birth was calculated from the reported age of the subject and the age of the eldest child if living. Comparing the age at first pregnancy with age at first parturition, good agreement is found for the nonmigrants, and for the downward migrants. For the migrants born at low altitude, there is some discrepancy between these ages. Nevertheless this discrepancy is small, and the figures lie well within the range observed for the other two groups. This consistency suggests that the errors in reporting ages are small and may be less than two years. The reported age at first marriage again lies within the same range, and the standard errors, for all three types of age are also consistent. It should be noted that formal marriage very frequently follows rather than precedes pregnancy in this area. For the migrants, consistency in reporting ages at births in different locations could be checked against their age at migration. Less than 10 per cent of these ages were inconsistent by more than two years.
The numbers of marriages, including all

socially recognized unions, show that there is an appreciable rate of remarriage in the populations. This follows the general pattern of serial monogamy found among peasants in Peru. The rate of remarriage found in the migrants is rather higher than among the nonmigrants, but not greatly different between these two populations. The type of marriage in the populations also varied according to migrant status, but not according to altitude of birthplace. Twenty-eight per cent of marriages among nonmigrants were consensual, compared to 38 per cent in the migrants, both from high and low altitude. In all three populations the proportion of consensual unions was increased with second unions.
The children born to these unions are described in Table 2. All subjects except one low altitude born migrant had given birth to at least one child. The number of abortions reported was low, less than 7 per cent of the pregnancies in each population. The rate of abortion was particularly low for the migrants born at high altitude, before they migrated to low altitude. After migration to low altitude these

Considering their total fertility, we see 7.69 is a little lower than the measure of 8.04 for the nonmigrants. This lower fertility is reflected in thecomparison of the parity intervals. An earlier start in reproductive life accounts for the

younger ages of the migrants at earlier parities, but longer parity intervals result in older ages at each parity for the migrants from the fourth birth on. It would appear that an earlier start to reproductive life compensates for rates of reproduction that are a little lower for the migrants.

effects of migration and the removal of the stress of hypoxia. Before migration, the downward migrants showed fertility rates that were similar to those of the nonmigrant population of Nufioa. The fertility of these subjects was greatest in the age group 25 to 29.9 years. Comparing the fertility of these migrants before and after migration, the difference is significant at the 0.01 level for the age groups 15 to 19.9

and 20 to 24.9 years. After migration, the fertility of the downward migrants is greatest in the age group 20 to 24.9 years; at the same time it is interesting to note that fertility is still high in the age group 30 to 34.9 years.

altitude. The downward migrants were similar to the migrants born at low altitude in that their fertility after migration was unrelated to the number of children born before migration, and their age at migration.

COMPARISONS WITHIN POPULATIONS
The comparisons made in the previous section can be used to illustrate the differences in fertility that result from the effects of hypoxia and migration. In this section comparisons within the populations are made in order to examine the extent to which socioeconomic and cultural factors and mating practices affect fertility. Characteristics of mating practices have already been described. The differences in socioeconomic and cultural factors between the populations at risk to pregnancy in the Tambo Valley are described in Table 5.
From the data on the altitude of birthplace of the parents of the subjects, it can be seen that very few of the low altitude born subjects were of high altitude ancestry. These results are consistent with the reports of the first language learned by the subjects. The distribution of the sub-

jects in the communities is uneven, in that a greater proportion of low altitude born subjects resided in Cocachacra. The communities in Dean Valdivia contained a higher proportion of migrants, which is related to the growth of population in this district in recent years. In general, this district is much poorer, with fewer urban facilities than either Cocachacra or Chucarapi.
The literacy and education of the subjects show that those born at low altitude

received more education than those born at high altitude. Nonmigrants were better educated than migrants born at low altitude. Again these factors are correlated with the language first learned by the subject.
With respect to the occupation of the subject, most were not employed. Of those that were employed, there was a higher proportion of migrants than nonmigrants; considering the type of employment, a higher proportion of subjects born at high altitude were employed in manual work compared to subjects born at low altitude.
With respect to the characteristics of the migrants before migration, both exposure to different elements of culture at high and low altitude, and the degree of exposure to urban or rural environments, may be relevant to their fertility after migration. Concerning their previous residence background, the proportions of each group of migrants born in towns of over 10,000 population were close to 40 per cent.
The relationships between these socioeconomic and cultural factors and fertility were examined using simple correlation, and multiple correlation and regression analysis. No significant relationships were discovered. At the same time, considering all age groups, the fertility of the downward migrants living in the Tambo Valley was found to be significantly greater, at the 0.5 level, than the fertility of the low altitude born subjects, migrant and nonmigrant, living in the valley.
Summarizing these results, it can be said that the differences in fertility between these rural populations living at different altitudes in the Andes are greater than the differences in fertility of the populations living at the same altitude. Secondly, the downward migrants, who showed the lowest rates of fertility prior to migration while living at high altitude, were the most

fertile subjects among those living at low altitude.
DISCUSSION
The data used in this study were retrospective reports of reproductive life histories. Data of this nature are subject to error in all societies, and errors in the data were detected in this study. However, the errors discovered would not account for the differences reported for high and low Andean populations. Although no absolute check could be made on the numbers of children reported, there was no obvious underreporting by those of lower social class, migrant status, or by altitude of birthplace. For the subjects of this study, differential reporting of births at high and low altitude is not a cause of differences in the numbers of births reported, because all data were collected from the subjects at one interview.
A second potential source of error exists in the accuracy of the reported ages of the subjects at vital events during reproductive life. Here there was reasonable correspondence between the age reported for first pregnancy, the age estimated for the subject at first live birth, and age at first marriage. Some discrepancy was found for the migrants born at low altitude, but this was small. In general, the reported ages were estimated to be accurate to within two years. For the migrants this was confirmed by comparing ages at migration with the ages of the subjects at the birth of children born before and after
t
migration. These errors are also of the same order found by Morris (1969) in a study of a similar nature in the Department of Lima, Peru. Again, those born at high altitude were no less accurate than the low altitude born subjects.
The reproductive life cycle of those living at high and low altitude, and of migrants and nonmigrants, in the Andes,

follow similar courses. The age at menarche is later among those living at high altitude (Sobrevilla, 1967; Cruz Coke, 1967; Frisancho and Baker, 1970), but this does not appear to affect age at first pregnancy or age at first marriage. The mean age at first pregnancy for the Tambo Valley nonmigrants was 19.77 years, compared to 20.00 years for the low altitude population of Arica, Chile (Cruz Coke, 1967). In this study, those born at high altitude showed a later mean age of first pregnancy than those born at low altitude, but for the high altitude population of Nufioa, Hoff (1968) found that the mean age of first pregnancy was 19.7 years. At Huallatire, this mean age was younger than for Arica (Cruz Coke, 1967).
The data on ages at first pregnancy and first marriage indicate that a subject is often at risk to pregnancy before a union is recognized. For this reason it is not possible to define the time at which a woman is at risk to pregnancy by the time when she is married. Since the pattern of marriage in Peru is one of serial monogamy and many of the population remarry, there is some doubt as to when a woman is at risk to pregnancy during the course of her reproductive life. In this study, all but one of the births were ascribed to a union, but this does not mean that all were conceived after the formal recognition of the union.
The rates of remarriage and of consensual unions among the subjects of this study were greater for the migrants than for the nonmigrants. The highest rate of remarriage was observed among low altitude born migrants; but this may simply reflect the fact that the mean age of this population was older than that of the migrants born at high altitude. However, the rates of remarriage and of consensual union do not appear to be related to fertility. Migrants born at high altitude were more fertile than nonmigrants, while the low

altitude born migrants were slightly less fertile.
Turning to differences in fertility between populations living at high and low altitude, the Tambo Valley nonmigrants provide data on the fertility of a low altitude rural Peruvian population. Their completed fertility was 8.29. This estimate is based on a small sample, but agrees quite well with the estimate of 8.04 for their total fertility which was derived from a larger quantity of data. They are more fertile than the populations of Nufioa and Huallatire where completed fertilities were 6.7 and 7.3 respectively. The number of abortions for the Tambo Valley nonmigrants were fewer than the 17 to 30 per cent of all pregnancies that Cruz Coke (1967) found for Arica, but higher than the number reported for Huallatire.
Migrants born at low altitude showed low rates of fertility before migration. However, data were only available for the age groups 15 to 19.9 and 20 to 24.9 years. After migration, the fertility of the low altitude born migrants was slightly but not significantly lower than the nonmigrants. Among these migrants, fertility increased with migration, but not to a level greater than the nonmigrants. These results are consistent with those of Myers and Morris (1966) and Macisco et al. (1969). In the same environment, migrants may be less fertile than nonmigrants. At the same time, as Myers (1972) showed, the fertility of migrants increases with migration.
Migrants born at high altitude also showed an increase in fertility with migration. However, before migration, the fertility of the downward migrants was similar to that of the nonmigrant population of Nufioa. The fertility of these migrants increased not only to a level greater than that of high altitude populations, but also to a level greater than that of low altitude born populations. After migration, these

25

migrants showed the highest rates of fertility for the ages between 20 and 30 years. Also, after migration the downward migrants reported abortions in almost the same frequency as the low altitude born populations, but the SSR among their offspring remained high.
Considering the changes in the fertility of the migrants, it is possible to evaluate some of the factors that have been proposed to affect fertility in the Andes. These factors include socioeconomic and cultural factors and the effects of the physical environment. Although migration is a further variable that may affect fertility, the results of this study do not suggest that this factor is important in itself. Before migration, the downward migrants showed fertility rates typical of a high Andean population. Migrants, from one residence to another in the same environment, did not differ significantly in their fertility after migration from nonmigrants. However, migration from high to low altitude is also accompanied by changes in the sociocultural and physical environment.
Differences in marital patterns and socioeconomic status do not appear to account for the differences in fertility between the populations of this study. In aggregate, migrants had higher rates of remarriage and consensual unions, but downward migrants living in the Tambo Valley were more fertile than nonmigrants born at low altitude. Low altitude born migrants, after migration, were not. Nor were any significant relationships found between fertility and these factors in the regression analysis.
Concerning the socioeconomic status of the downward migrants, this was lower than that of the low altitude born nonmigrants both before and after migration; yet before migration the downward migrants were the least fertile population of all. After migration they were the most

fertile. Thus, while socioeconomic conditions may change on migration from high to low altitude, the changes in these conditions do not appear a major factor in the changes in fertility.
Another factor accompanying migration from high to low altitude is acculturation. However, Mejia (1963) reported that downward migrants in Peru are poorly acculturated, and that they are poorly integrated into the communities to which they migrate. In addition, Morris (1969) failed to show any consistent relationship between his index of acculturation and fertility.
Two other factors that were suggested as possible explanations of reduced fertility at high altitude in the Andes were the greater number of women in the female labor force and the adult sex ratio (Heer, 1964, 1967). Both of these factors are of course correlated with altitude. Women among the downward migrants who participated in the labor force did not show reduced fertility. Concerning the adult sex ratio, this is low in areas of emigration, and high in areas of immigration. In the Andes most migration is from high to low altitude.
The results of this study are consistent with the hypothesis that hypoxia acts to reduce fertility. This is supported by the fact that changes in fertility occurred as soon as migration from high to low altitude occurred and did not appear to be related to previous fertility experience. In studies where sociocultural factors have been the main factors influencing fertility in migrants, some time has elapsed before changes were seen in the fertility of the migrants (Goldberg, 1959; Iutaka et al., 1971). With respect to the reproductive performance of the downward migrants, the change in the number of abortions reported may be further evidence that

SUMMARY
In this study, a population comparison technique was applied to assess the effect of altitude on fertility. The effect of the removal of the stress of hypoxia has been illustrated by the comparison of the reproductive performance of nonmigrants resident at high and low altitudes, and of migrants to low altitude from birthplaces at both high and low altitude.
The data used were retrospective reports of reproductive life histories. While these data are not precise, they may be used to compare the fertility of populations, using the number of children born in a five-year age interval as a measure of fertility. The

Several possible explanations which might account for the increase in fertility of the downward migrants on migration from high to low altitude were considered. These included migration, socioeconomic factors, acculturation, seasonal male emigration from high altitude, and the removal of the stress of hypoxia. Of these factors, altitude appears to be the most significant.
