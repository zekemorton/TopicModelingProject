Probably no subject is of more fundamental importance to the future of human society than that of changing patterns of fertility. United Nations officials have pointed out that the fertility level is one of the best predictors available of the state of modernization of a country. With but few exceptions the countries of high fertility are the "developing" countries, and the countries of low fertility are the well-modernized countries.
This paper is concerned with three aspects of changing fertility patterns in the United States: trends in the average levels of fertility, trends in age at marriage and child spacing, and trends in the differentials in fertility.
TRENDS INAVERAGE LEVELS OF FERTILITY
As in some other modern countries, the fertility trends in the United States fall into three distinct periods--the long period of declining fertility prior to World War II, the wartime and postwar baby boom, and the resumed declines since 1957.
Fertility was conspicuously high in colonial America. Benjamin Franklin noted this fact as early as 1755. Thomas Malthus, in his first edition of Principles of Population, published in 1798, used the United States as an example of the capacity for population to double every 25 years, the approximate

average length of a generation at that time. Students have estimated that during the colonial period the average woman of completed fertility had borne about 8 children. The country was largely rural and agricultural and the frontier to the West stimulated early marriage and large families.
I t is not possible to pinpoint the year or decade of initial decline in fertility. However, ratios of resident white children under age 5 to white women of childbearing age (15-44) document the existence of a virtually uninterrupted decline from 1810 to 1930. Only one census, that of 1860, failed to show a decline of fertility ratio over that of the preceding census.
The translation of fertility ratios into crude birth rates, i.e., number of births during a year per 1,000 white population, yields an estimate of 54 for the year 1810, 43 for 1850, 35 for 1880, and 30 for 1900 (Thompson and Whelpton, 1933). The crude birth rate for whites adjusted for under-registration was 26.9 in 1920, and it dropped to a low pobt of 17.6 in 1933 and 1936 (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1969).1
1 Using a different method, Coale and Zelnik (1963) secured essentially similar results. They estimated the birth rate for whites in the United States to be about 43 for 1855, 34 for 1880, and 28.5 for 1900. Their estimates yielded 25.0for 1920,a low of 16.7 for 1933,and 16.9 for 1936.

During the thirties there was much concern about the small family. Pronatalist legislation was the vogue in countries of Western Europe, and it was during this decade that the Indianapolis Study of Social and Psychological Factors was initiated in order to investigate the reasons for the small family in a typical urban center of the United States. Projecting the currently low and declining fertility rates, leading students of population projected peak populations for this country in the sixties and even in the fifties with declines thereafter. However, following the low crude birth rate of 1936 there was a gradual recovery. There were distinct spurts in the early forties arising partly from increasing marriage rates associated with defense production and the apparent resort to parenthood to avoid the draft. There followed some declines in the birth rate during 1942-45 when larger and larger proportions of young men of prime military age were sent to European or Far Eastern war areas.
The rapid demobilization of men following the end of the war in Europe and the Far East in 1945 brought a spectacular increase in the marriage rate in 1946 and an equally marked increase in the birth rate in 1947. These immediate postwar increases surprised no one, least of all the demographers. What did surprise everyone, and perhaps especially the demographers, was the persistence of the postwar increases in fertility. The search for causes of the sustained postwar increases led Whelpton to pioneering work in cohort fertility analysis (Whelpton, 1954). He was able to demonstrate that much of the initial postwar increase hi fertility was due to eventuation of marriages previously postponed because of economic and wartime conditions rather than to increase in size of completed family.
However, the increases lasted longer than expected. Ryder and others have demonstrated that much of the sustained increase was due to trends toward earlier marriage and to decrease in intervals between mar-

riage and first birth and between successive births rather than to increase in completed size of family. Ryder's development of techniques for differentiating period and cohort fertility is one of the methodological gains of this period (Ryder, 1969).
Nonetheless, there were marked increases in size of completed family, although there was no reversion to the large families of 1910 and earlier. The increase was due rather to declines in proportions of childless and onechild families and to increases in proportions of families with 2-4 children. In fact, the popularization of families of this size during the past twenty years has been one of the conspicuous patterns of modem fertility trends. Ryder has stated "One of the more interesting and important changes that have been occurring in American fertility is the diminution in the dispersion of women among the various parities. This phenomenon may be directly measured by parity variance. This parameter has declined from 7.89 for C. 1891-95 to 4.25 for C. 1936-40 . . . " (Ryder, 1969).
Just as the persistence of the postwar baby boom was a surprise to demographers, the decrease in birth rates that has been under way since 1957 in the United States and other modem countries has been the subject of much debate. Here again Ryder's work has been helpful in that it indicates that much of the decrease is due to a cessation or reversal of the trend toward lower age at marriage and to a cessation of the decrease in intervals from marriage to first birth and between successive births, rather than to actual reduction in size of completed family.
Again, however, some declines in size of completed family would result from continuation of current fertility trends. This is suggested by cohort fertility analysis and by recent declines in the reported average number of children "expected" by young women in recent years.

and nonwhite women by number of children ever born reaching 45-49 years of age at indicated years. The data for years 1885-1910 are from the 1910 census; those for 1905 are for women 50-54 in 1910; those for 1900 are for women 55-59, etc. The validity of this method will be discussed later. The relatively low proportions childless and relatively high proportions with large families among women completing the childbearing period prior to 1910 are conspicuous, especially for the Negroes.2
TRENDS IN AGE AT MARRIAGE AND CHILD SPACING
We have already noted that the trends in period fertility are resultants of trends in age at marriage and child spacing and trends in cohort fertility. Period fertility may be defined as the average fertility of all birth cohorts during a specific period such as one year. Cohort fertility is the cumulative fertility of a given cohort passing through life. The former focuses on the period; the latter on the cohort. It is well, however, to consider briefly the trends in age at marriage and child spacing. Ryder has considered these two variables to be the components of what he calls the tempo of fertility. He describes tempo "as a terse designation of the observed time pattern of marriage rates or birth rates." He explains that the words " 'spacing' and 'timing' are more common, but they are unsatisfactory because they imply rather more volition than is appropriate for most couples" (Ryder, 1969).
It is common knowledge that the postwar baby boom was accompanied by a trend toward more marriages, earlier age at marriage, and by reduction in interval between marriage and first and successive births. Thus, among women 20-24 years old in the United States the proportion ever married (including widowed and divorced) was about 53% in 1940,68% in 1950, and 72% in 1960.
2 Data for censuses prior to 1950 relate to native white and Negro ever-married women; those for later censuses relate to white and nonwhite evermarried women.

For those 45-49, the proportion ever married was about 9 1 % in 1940, 92% in 1950, and 93.5% in 1960 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1953, 1961).
Ryder's total nuptiality rate which he defined as the proportion of women married (at least once) by exact age 50 was 9 1 % for those born during 1901-5, 95% for those born during 1916-20, and 98% for those born during 1931-35 and 1936-40. The estimate for those born during 1941-45 dropped back to 95%, a recent trend in line with the decline in the birth rate since 1957. For these same five birth cohorts, the mean ages of nuptiality were respectively 23.21, 22.73, 21.35, 21.32, and 21.55.
The "mean age of fertility" of women was 26.89 years for the cohort of 1901-5, 27.78 for the cohort of 1916-20, 26.19 for the cohort of 1931-35, 25.94 for the cohort of 1936-40, and 26.42 for the cohort of 194145. Although somewhat irregular, the trend was generally upward for women born during 1901-1915, downward for those born during 1916-1940, and upward for those born since 1940.
A recent report from the Bureau of the Census stated: "A distinct trend toward childbearing at an earlier age was observed for women born between 1910 and 1940, but this trend is probably not being continued by women born in the first half of the 1940's. The evidence points to a new tendency toward starting childbearing at an older age. . . . Moreover, a distinct trend toward childbearing sooner after marriage was observed for women who married in the 1940's and 1950's, but this trend is not being continued by white women who entered first marriages between 1960 and 1964" (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1969J).
TRENDS IN DIFFERENTIALS IN FERTILITY
During 1950-60 there was an enhancement of fertility differences by color, and perhaps also by religion. There was a narrowing of fertility differences by region,

306

urban-rural residence, and, with some exceptions, by socioeconomic status.
The widening of fertility differences by color during the decade arose from the more rapid increases in fertility among nonwhites than among whites. It seems likely that this trend has continued since 1960 because the declines in fertility since 1957 have been earlier and more pronounced among the whites than among the nonwhites (Kiser, Grabill, and Campbell, 1968).
Important qualifications to the above paragraph are: (a) the white-nonwhite differentials are strongest in the South and weakest in the Northeast and (5) the whitenonwhite differentials in fertility are strongest in the lowest socioeconomic strata and weakest in the professional, college-educated, and highest income groups. In fact, among college-trained wives 25-49 years of age, fertility rates tend to be lower among nonwhites than among whites (Kiser and Frank, 1967).
The sharper increases in fertility among the nonwhites than among the whites mentioned above probably arose in part from the improved health conditions among urban Negroes after World War II. Prior to World War II, urban Negro marriages were characterized by conspicuously high proportions of childless couples. The clean-up of venereal disease probably accounted for the sharp declines in proportions childless among young Negro wives.
Despite recent past trends, it seems likely that the increase in proportions of nonwhite women completing high school and attending college will result in narrowing of the fertility differentials by color.
The narrowing of the fertility differences by region has been due in part to decreasing regional differences in proportions of the population living in rural and urban areas and to decreasing regional differences in the composition of the population by color. Part of the high standing of the South with respect to fertility was due to the relatively high proportion living in rural areas and the

high proportion of Negroes in its population. At present, it is only because of its relatively high proportion of Negroes that the South outranks the North Central States with respect to fertility. Stated in another manner, regional differences in fertility are wider for Negroes than for whites.
CHANGING PATTERNS OF FERTILITY BY SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS
As mentioned above, there is "with some exceptions" a current trend toward narrowing of fertility differences by socioeconomic status. One exception is the apparent lack of such a trend at present among nonwhites. Another is the suggestion of sharper differentials in 1960 than in 1950 among white married women of youngest ages.
Whatever the present situation regarding the exceptions may be, there has been for some time a marked trend toward diminution of the fertility differentials by socioeconomic status among white women in virtually all modern countries.
A frequent theory of the current trend toward narrowing of differentials is that such differentials are temporary phenomena associated with the demographic transition. The theory is that prior to the demographic transition the fertility rates for all classes were fairly uniformly high. The urban women of highest socioeconomic status were the first to resort to family limitation practices and hence were the leaders in the trend toward small families. Family planning practices eventually filtered downward through the socioeconomic classes and outward to rural areas. The rural women of lowest socioeconomic status, according to this theory, are the last to accept family planning. This process would yield first an enlargement and later a diminution of class differences in fertility.
The available data appear to support the above-mentioned hypothesis in general respects. Actually, few data are available regarding the trends in fertility rates by socioeconomic status during the early years of the

demographic transition. Fortunately, however, data from the 1910 census on the fertility of women by occupation group of the husband, are available by age of woman, not only for women of childbearing age, but also for those of older ages. Thus, the analysis can be pushed back to periods preceding 1910.
The case is illustrated by Table 3 and Figure 1, presenting fertility rates among women 45-49 observed or imputed for the years 1885-1965. The data for years 1910, 1940, 1950, and 1960 are those for women 45-49 years old at those census dates.3 The
3 Certain qualifications regarding the occupational fertility data should be emphasized. The data based upon the 1910 and 1940 censuses relate to native white women "married once and husband present." Those for 19S0 relate to white women "married once and husband present." Those for later years relate to white women "married andhus-

data for the years prior to 1910 were derived from the 1910 census for women older than 45-49.4 Those for 1920 are for women 65-69 and those for 1930 are for women 55-59 reband present." Doubtlessly there were also some changes in rules concerning the collection, coding, editing, and tabulation of occupational and fertility data. However, these inconsistencies probably would not alter thelarge aspects of thetrends and differentials described.
4 Thus, women 55-59 in 1910 reached 45-49 in 1900; those 65-69 in 1910 reached 45-49 in 1890; and those 70-74 in 1910 reached 45-49 in 1885. The use of data for survivors of earlier cohorts of women of completed fertility raises questions of selectivity of survivors according to fertility and socioeconomic status. The two chief studies on this problem were restricted to survivorship in relation to fertility among women of completed fertility and yielded somewhat different results. Freeman (1935) found no relation of fertility to longevity among women surviving the childbearing period. Dorn and McDowell (1939) found a positive relation, but this was partly induced by the method in which the categories were established.

porting in the 1940 census. The data for 1965 are those for women 40-44 in the 1960 census.
The data in Figure 1, plotted on a semilogarithmic chart, suggest a pronounced enhancement of occupational differentials in size of completed family from 1885 to 1920. This was due to the earlier and sharper declines among the wives of "white-collar" men than among wives of craftsmen, laborers, and farmers. Prior to 1910, the declines were especially marked for the wives of professional men and least for the laborers and farmers.
The data further suggest a fairly unchanging pattern of differentials from 1920 to 1950. Since 1950 there has been a sharp contraction of occupational differentials in size of completed families. This has been due to earlier and sharper increases in fertility of the white-collar classes than among the others.

In Table 4 and Figure 2 the relative variations are shown by expressing the fertility rate for each occupational class as a per cent of the base rate5 for the total age group (4549) of the period considered.
The indices in Figure 2 present the changing pattern of relative variations apart from secular trends in fertility levels. Except for the farm laborers, the outline of Figure 2 as delineated by the experiences of the farmers and professional class is the shape of a Chinese lantern lying on its side.6 In 1885 the
5 This is the equivalent to the use of index numbers with the base rate expressed as 100. The base rates were standardized to the occupational distribution of the women 50-54 in 1910 (considered as 45-49 in 1905). This was done to eliminate the effect of changing occupational composition on magnitude of the base rate.
6 The farm laborers constituted only about 3%of the native white wives 45-49 in 1910, and 2% in 1940. They formed about 2% of the white wives in 1950 and 1% in 1960. Since 1960 they probably have been increasingly composed of Mexican and Puerto Rican migrant workers (see Table 7).

deviations of the extreme classes from the average were small. The deviations were at the maximum during 1920-50. Since 1950, the range of variations hasdecreased considerably.
When theanalysis is restricted to urban whites innonagricultural occupations, there is still a distinct enlargement of the differentials prior to 1910 anda distinct contraction after 1950. There islittle difference between 1910 and 1940 with respect torelative variation in fertility by occupational group among urban white women of completed fertility. The rates are shown inTable 5 and are plotted on a semi-logarithmic chart in Figure 3. The indices of relative variations are shown in Table 6 and Figure 4.
The relative variations in fertility of urban white women were larger for women 45-49 years old in 1950 than for women that age in 1940. However, there wasa sharp contraction during 1950-60. For women of younger ages, there was a sharp contraction after 1940 (Kiser, Grabill, and Campbell, 1968, p.204-206).

The changes in occupational distribution during thepast eighty years have been remarkable. Because of differential mortality according to socioeconomic status, thedistributions for the years 1890, 1900, 1920, and 1930 probably are somewhat overly represented bythe white-collar groups and under-represented bythe laborers and agricultural workers. However, the data in the upper tier of Table 7 reflect strongly and truly the decline in proportion of farmers and theincrease in theproportion of nonagricultural workers, especially those classified as clerical, craft, and operatives. When the distributions are restricted to the wives of nonagricultural workers, as in thelower section of Table 7, the most striking increases were those for operatives.

and following censuses for total women and ever-married women, by age andresidence.7
As expected, the range of relative variations in fertility by education tends to be wider for all women than for ever-married women, especially at younger ages. This is because differentials by proportions married tend to runin thesame direction as differentials in fertility (Kiser, Grabill, and Campbell, 1968,p. 156).
The patterns of variations in fertility by education since 1940have been much the same as those by occupation. Among white women or married women at each five-year age group in the 20-44 span there were sharp contractions in the differentials during 194060. Figure 5 presents the data for women 35-39 years old.Among the women 45-49, there wasagain a similarity with theoccupational pattern in that the range of relative variations increased a little from 1940 to 1950 and then decreased (Figure 6). This suggests that the older women were mani-

festing an earlier period of expansion of class differences in fertility.
I t should be emphasized that the sharp contractions in fertility differentials of white women by occupation of the husband and by educational attainment of the wife occurred in thecontext of increasing fertility during the 1940-60 period. The increases were proportionately higher for thewivesof professional and white-collar workers and for wives of college attainment than for wives of lower socioeconomic status.
The available data foryears since 1960,a period of declining fertility, yield somewhat mixed results. Data on number of own children under 5 years old collected by the Bureau of the Census in Current Population Surveys in March 1968 and 1967 indicated higher percentage decreases of the ratios from 1960 to 1968 among the farm than among thenonfarm women, greater declines among nonwhites than among whites, and greater declines among women graduating from high school than among those of lower educational attainment (U.S.Bureau ofthe Census, 1969a).

those among young women, diminished greatly. The decrease in the crude birth rate since 1957appears to have been accompanied by some reassertion of fertility differentials among young women.
