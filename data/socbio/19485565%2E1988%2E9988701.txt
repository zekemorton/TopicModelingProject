ABSTRACT: The rate of childlessness in the United States has increased over the last two decades. Changing or differential rates by different segments of society have important implications for society. Most previous studies have relied on unrepresentative opportunistic samples to identify those segments of society with lower or higher rates of childlessness. These types of samples may misestimate both the number of women planning to remain childless and the magnitude of the correlates of childlessness. The present study uses these previous studies to identify predictor variables, but tests their significance using a recent national representative sample of women in the United States, aged 20-44: Cycle III of the National Survey for Family Growth, collected in 1982. The most important demographic factors are marital status and fecundity status, followed by age, race or ethnicity, education of the respondent, labor force status, and region. Father's education and mother's education are slightly, but not significantly, related to childlessness. Contrary to findings from less representative samples, urban-rural differences and religion are not related to childlessness.

Norms pertaining to family structure in the United States have changed, making childlessness, and particularly voluntary childlessness, a more accepted and desired lifestyle (Poston and Gotard, 1977; Poston and Kramer, 1983). Childlessness has far-reaching consequences in family life and society. Should it be adopted by a large segment of the population, it could mean a decrease in population, particularly for ethnic or religious groups which do not foster the norm of having children. Childlessness could complicate a potentially top-heavy population of elderly in our society and thus worsen individual problems associated with the aged (Bachrach, 1980). In the long term, differential rates of childlessness also has implications for the decline and possible disappearance of some segments of society (Houseknecht, 1978; Veevers, 1973).

Effective birth control technology has made the conscious decision to remain childless easier for women (Veevers, 1973), allowing them to combine or exclude marriage, children, and career, with little interference in their sex lives. For the first time, with the possible exception of the Depression of the 1930's when childlessness became a strategy for economic survival, voluntary childlessness is a viable lifestyle choice (Bloom and Bennett, 1986).
Changes in the normative and socialstructural aspects of our society also foster an environment favoring childlessness. Factors such as work histories, parental attitudes, support for other nonparents, and participation in the labor force have become important (Ory, 1978). Perhaps, the most significant changes have come in the form of changing gender roles. With the women's movement of the 1960's and 1970's came

Later, we shall include both the voluntarily and involuntarily childless to examine the magnitude of total childlessness among the various sociodemographic groups.

We retain two distinctions suggested by most recent researchers (see Poston, 1976; Mosher and Bachrach, 1982;

estants to have higher rates of childlessness than others, while Poston (1976) found the highest rates of childlessness among Baptists and Methodists, though Catholics were close to them, and all others had much lower rates.
Marital status affects the parenting decision. Marrying and having children continue to prevail as the norm for most people in the United States, and this is not likely to change for the majority (Veevers, 1973). Conversely, those who have not married or are living in an informal marriage without legal sanction should exhibit higher levels of childlessness. Mosher and Bachrach (1982) noted that marital status was an important correlate of childlessness.
Finally, biology plays a role in childlessness. We focus on correlates of those who are voluntarily childless. In the end we include the involuntarily childless, those who are sterile for noncontraceptive reasons and those who are subfecund. We then recompute the total rates of childless so that the total impact can be ascertained.
SAMPLE
The Cycle HI of the National Survey for Family Growth, 1982, provides an excellent sample of childless women for study. Approximately 8,000 women ages 15-44 were extensively interviewed on personal background as well as expectations for additional children. Those 15-19 years of age were excluded as they probably have yet to crystallize their family ideals. The childless are those 363 women, aged 20-44, who reported having no children and expecting none. First, we report the percentage of women who are childless in each category of the variables considered. Then all of the variables are considered simultaneously to show adjusted percentages

of childlessness when the other variables are controlled. Eta measures the strength of the relationship between each independent variable and childlessness.
One limitation of the data set is that none of the questions were directed toward reasons for childlessness since the survey included women 15-44, most of whom planned to have or already had children. Thus we rely on demographic variables as predictors of childlessness.
RESULTS
The results are presented in Table 1. The best predictor variable is marital status. As expected, the highest rates of childlessness are among the nevermarried and the informally married. The lowest rates are among the married and divorced or separated. Many nevermarried women who know they have fertility problems expect to remain childless. The eta for marital status becomes even more important when the effects of the other variables are added in, rising from 0.14 to 0.20 for voluntarily childless women.
As expected, age has an approximately linear relationship with childlessness; the older the women, the more likely they are to remain childless. This increase in expected childlessness in many cases is likely a revision of earlier intentions. Some of the revision probably also reflects the discovery of infertility or difficulties in pregnancy, childbearing, or childrearing. Furthermore, some women may change their plans as divorce or other problems arise. Still others may become involved in career opportunities, or fail to marry and thus choose to remain childless. A countertrend may actually be hidden in these results. Acceptance of a childless life

may be stronger among younger cohorts of women, but be concealed by the more pronounced trends accompanying age.
Education is also related to the decision to remain childless, but in a slightly curvilinear way as shown in Table 1. Schooling provides more options for a woman than the traditional role of motherhood. Many choose to take advantage of these new opportunities, and children no longer become as high a priority as they have in the past. This effect is most evident at the post-college level where 10.6 per cent of the fecund women are childless. Women who had less than a complete high-school education had slightly higher levels of childlessness than those with a high-school degree or some college. These slightly higher rates may be a result of less stable marriages or more health problems among the poor. This curvilinear relationship persists when adjustments are made for all the other variables. This indicates that age, marital status, and

other factors are not operating to produce the higher rates of childlessness among those women with low levels of education.
Mother's education shows a consistent linear pattern. Nearly 11per cent of the fecund women whose mothers have post-college education are childless, a substantial increase over women who have less education. Nevertheless, the results are not statistically significant. Houseknecht (1978) explains that childlessness often occurs among women who have dominant mothers. An educated mother would be more powerful, and perhaps more dominant and influential than a poorly educated mother. An alternative explanation is that the mother represents a nontraditional role model for the daughter. In either case, the effect is not strong enough to be statistically significant in this sample. Father's education does not show any consistent pattern.

a difference in rates of childlessness. The highest rates of childlessness occur among those working and those who indicate that they are not working (e.g., temporarily unemployed). The next highest rate is for those in school, and the lowest rates are among those who specify their status as "keeping house." These results are consistent with traditional role expectations for working women and for homemakers.
Black-white differences in childlessness are substantial and significant. Consistent with Veevers (1982) and Mosher and Bachrach (1982), we found higher rates of voluntary childlessness among whites (5.5 per cent) than among blacks (3.6 per cent). This difference is even more pronounced when the other factors are controlled; the rates become 6.1 for whites and 2.8 for blacks. The highest rates of voluntary childlessness were among Asians (7.7 per cent) and, surprisingly, among American Indians (5.9 per cent). The number of Asians and Indians in the sample is quite small, however, and the rates thus subject to wide sampling fluctuations. Hispanics had the lowest rate of childlessness (1.6 per cent). When the rates were adjusted for the other variables, the rate for Indians became 7.4 per cent, the highest of any of the groups.
Despite the predictions drawn from findings and comments by Poston (1976), Ory (1978), Pol (1983), Mosher and Bachrach (1982), and Mosher and Hendershot (1984), religion has almost no effect on childlessness. Those claiming no religious affiliation and those who list their affiliation as other than traditional churches report higher rates of childlessness, but the number of individuals was fairly small and the overall eta for religion is not statistically significant. The differences between Catholics,

mainline Protestants, and fundamentalist Protestants are small, especially after controls have been applied. Mosher and Hendershot (1984) indicate that although religion should be considered in determining fertility rates, other factors (such as ethnicity) also have an effect. They argue that religion alone cannot be used to determine childlessness rates. We found no effect for religion.
Regional differences in childlessness are minor, though statistically significant. The primary differences are a somewhat higher rate of childlessness in the Northeast and a still slightly higher rate in the West.
Several previous researchers have found urban-rural differences in childlessness. But the way in which most samples have been obtained evidently influenced this variable, for we find no difference in rates of childlessness in urban and rural areas. The urban rate is slightly higher (4.8 per cent compared to 4.1 per cent), but the eta for this difference is not statistically significant. Furthermore, when the percentage is adjusted for the other variables, the two rates are close, 4.7 compared to 4.3. The norm for large families traditionally associated with rural areas may be changing, making rural rates similar to urban rates.
When all childless women are considered (see Table 2), the strength of most of the correlates is diminished slightly. This is because infecundity and subfecundity are unrelated to race, region, education, etc. Note in Table 2 that fecundity status is the best predictor of intent to remain childless. The one variable that has a closer relationship to childlessness in Table 2 than in Table 1is marital status. In particular, over 35 per cent of the subfecund or infecund who have never married expect to remain

childless. This finding suggests that many of them do not expect or intend to marry.
DISCUSSION
At present, the total rate of childlessness is a relatively small per cent (6.4) of all women aged 20-44. Childlessness exceeds 10 per cent only among unusual subgroups such as the highly educated, the never married, the unemployed, American Indians, the nonreligious, and the noncontraceptively sterile. Furthermore, some of the presently childless may later decide to have children. Nevertheless, the identification of those influences that affect the decision to have or not have children is important. Some of the variables reflect structural

and normative changes that have occurred in society.
Most of the predictor variables culled from the literature are not strongly related to childlessness. Small subgroup differences suggest that childbearing remains a dominant role in most segments of American society. That large groups of women will choose not to have any children in the near future is doubtful. Nevertheless, variation in childlessness exists. The most important demographic predictors were fecundity status and marital status followed by age. Less important, but still significant, were labor force status and woman's education and race. Mother's education, father's education, urban-rural residence, region, and religion had negligible effects. The failure of some of these variables to
