ABSTRACT: A sample survey wasconducted of a nationwide voluntary association whose purpose is to challenge societal pressures to have children and to provide support for those choosing to remain childless. The membership waspredominantly under 35 years of age and married, almost entirely Caucasian, disproportionately concentrated in the higher education and income categories, and not committed to religion. Asked to rate the importance of various reasons for their decision not to have children, members under 35 years of age most frequently cited the deleterious effect of children on personal independence, the responsibility of rearing a child, and the interference of children with the marital relationship. Two out of three members under 35 intending to have no children reported pressures to have children, with the media, friends, and coworkers (but not parents) most often named as the leading sources.

The traditional premise in American cent were uncertain, with women giving

society that children are a desirable aspect these responses more often than men.

of marriage has recently been challenged by two studies based on national sample surveys (Institute for Social Research, 1974). In the words of one:

There thus exists a substantial number of Americans whose happiness has been negatively affected by children and who are willing to express their dissatisfaction

The best of all possible worlds, for most Americans, is to be newly married and not have children. . . . Almost as soon as a couple has kids, their happy bubble bursts. For both menand women, reports of happiness and satisfaction drop to average, notto rise again significantly until their children are grown and about to leave the nest. (Campbell, 1975, pp. 38,39)

with parenthood. The 10 per cent in the McCall's survey reporting they would not have children again represent approximately 5.5 million adults (McLaughlin, 1975). Such extensive dissatisfaction would seem almost certain to generate a large pool of childless individuals unwilling to become parents, despite the influ-

and social in nature and has a nationwide membership with 62 local chapters in 31 states.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
In November, 1975, the authors sent a ten-page questionnaire to a sample of NON members obtained by systematic sampling. Every third person on the national organization's membership roster who had paid dues for 1975 and who resided in the United States was selected for the sample. (There are an unknown number of individuals who belong to local chapters but who have not paid dues to the national organization and do not appear on the latter's membership roster.) A total of 420 members received the questionnaire, and 334 completed it, a return rate of 80 per cent. The return rate was obtained with a single mailing of the questionnaire, reminder postcards sent to the entire sample a few days later and to nonrespondents approximately three weeks after the questionnaire, and notices of the survey in the NON membership newsletter before and during the datagathering period.
The 80 per cent return rate compares well with the 73 per cent obtained by Barnett (1974) in a survey of the membership of Zero Population Growth where a comparable procedure but substantially shorter questionnaire was used and with the 74 per cent, 75 per cent, and 82 per cent obtained in three mailed questionnaire surveys of Sierra Club members between 1969 and 1972 (Bartell and St. George, 1973; Devall, 1970).
Four lines of sociological research have a bearing on the present study and help predict the NON membership profile. First is research on membership in voluntary associations generally. Using national survey data, Hyman and Wright (1971) report that the majority of Americans are not members of a voluntary association

but that the probability of membership increases with education and is higher among white-collar than blue-collar occupations. Second is research on the population control movement; NON has obvious relevance to the movement and, indeed, has described itself as "a population and personal rights organization" (National Organization for Non-Parents, 1975). This line of research consists of two studies (Barnett, 1971, 1974) on the membership of Zero Population Growth and will be used in the discussion below to provide a comparison with the findings of the present study on the demographic characteristics of NON members. Third is research on the correlates of support for women's rights. Welch (1975) reports that support among women for the women's liberation movement increases with education, occupational status, and liberalism and declines with increasing age and religious orthodoxy. Fourth is research on the diffusion of innovations; in view of the strong American ideal favoring childbearing (Blake, 1974), voluntary childlessness would seem to be an innovative concept. A review of research found that early acceptance of innovations is associated with high education and income and with low levels of dogmatism and rigidity (Rogers, 1962).
The preceding research thus leads to the expectation that NON members will be concentrated among those: (1) in the higher echelons of education, income, and occupation; (2) in the younger age groups (which can also be expected from the fact that the focus of the organization is on the childbearing years); (3) possessing a liberal, nonrigid, nondogmatic, nontraditional philosophy.
RESULTS
We will begin by examining the distribution of NON members on variables most relevant to the nature of the organi-

zation. Where the data exist for a relevant comparison, NON members will be compared with the members of Zero Population Growth (ZPG) since, as indicated above, NON describes itself as a population organization in part. There is some overlap in the membership of the two organizations; 29 per cent of the NON respondents in the present survey reported that they were members of ZPG, but since ZPG is numerically much larger, NON members constitute only 4 per cent of the current ZPG membership.
It should be noted that the ZPG data were gathered approximately five years prior to the current survey and that the size of the ZPG membership has declined drastically in this time. However, in the period between his two surveys, Barnett (1974) found no change that was statistically significant at the 0.0S level in the distribution of the key demographic variables describing the membership. These surveys, while conducted less than a year apart, spanned a doubling of membership size and suggest that the distribution of demographic variables is relatively insensitive to substantial alterations in number of members.
Let us first deal with the marital characteristics of NON members. Only a minority were single--16 per cent reported themselves to be single and never married and 6 per cent reported themselves to be divorced. Four out of five were thus currently married--69 per cent, married and never divorced; 6 per cent, married and previously divorced; 1 per cent, married and previously widowed; and 2 per cent, separated. The married members, moreover, appeared to enjoy being married, since SO per cent had been married six years or longer and only 12 per cent had been married two years or less.
NON members are not only predominantly married, but they are also predominantly in their childbearing years. In

terms of age, they are similar to, though slightly older than, the members of Zero Population Growth (Barnett, 1974). The mean age of the NON sample was 31 years and the median was 29 years, with 12 per cent under 25, 44 per cent 25-29, 24 per cent 30-34, 10 per cent 35-39, and 11 per cent 40 or over. However, even though concentrated in their childbearing period, few NON members have children or intend to have children. Only 9 per cent in the sample as a whole, and only 3 per cent of those under 35 years of age, have children. Of those who were childless and in their prime childbearing years (i.e., under 35), the vast majority intend to remain childless; 93 per cent intend to have no children while 3 per cent intend to have one child and 4 per cent intend to have two.
In terms of measures of achievement, NON members are disproportionately well-educated compared to the general United States population (for which information was obtained on persons 14 years of age and older from U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1974). Only 12 per cent of the NON membership had not gone to college compared to 76 per cent of the United States population as a whole. Seventy per cent of NON members had at least a bachelor's degree; by contrast, only 11 per cent of the American people have four or more years of college. Thirty-three per cent had a graduate (master's or doctoral) degree, but only 4 per cent of the United States population has five or more years of college.
Unfortunately, a comparison of the educational attainment of NON members as a whole with that of the population as a whole is potentially misleading. The probability of acquiring a college education is highest in the very age categories in which NON members are concentrated. To determine whether the educational attainment of the NON membership is indepen-

their achievement in the realm of education is greater than their achievement in the realm of income.
A further indication of the socioeconomic status of NON members is found in their distribution on the status scores for 589 occupations developed by Nam et al. (1975, p. 571) which, using 1970 census data, specify "the approximate percentage of persons in the experienced civilian labor force who are in occupations having combined average levels of education and income below that for the given occupation." Excluding those who were students or unemployed, an open-ended question on occupation showed that almost half (47 per cent) of the members were in the top 20 per cent and that almost one-fourth (23 per cent) were in the top 10 per cent.
The relatively high achievement level of NON members can be partially attributed to the fact that they generally were reared in small families or were born before any siblings. Both of these factors have been found linked to high achievement in education, income, and occupation (Orshansky and Bretz, 1976; Terhune, 1974; Wray, 1971). Fifteen per cent were only children, 32 per cent had just one sibling, and 53 per cent had two or more siblings. In the population as a whole, children born to women who were 50-59 years old in 1975 (and who were 20-29 years old

when the average NON member was born) were likely to come from larger families: 6 per cent were only children and 19 per cent had just one sibling (calculated from U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1973). In terms of birth order, 38 per cent of all members were the first children their parents had. Thus, slightly over half were either only children or the first-born (15 per cent + 38 per cent = 53 per cent).
One of the most distinctive features of NON members uncovered in the present study is found in their religious affiliations and particularly in the changes that have occurred between the religions in which they were raised and those with which they now identify. Table 2 provides the distribution of the respondents' original and current religious orientations and the distribution for the United States population as a whole. The latter is from a 1957 census bureau survey assessing religious identification; being two decades old, it suggests the original religions of today's population, but it has also been employed as "the most reliable" estimate of the current religious distribution of the population (Steinberg, 1973, p. 102).
In terms of the religions in which NON members were raised, Table 2 indicates that Protestants and Catholics are slightly underrepresented in the membership and that Jews, agnostics, and other religious

orientations are overrepresented. Thisdistribution is remarkably similar to that found in Zero Population Growth (Barnett, 1974). In terms of current religious identification among NON members, the religious groups continue their pattern of overrepresentation or underrepresentation, but except for Jews, the magnitude of the over- or underrepresentation is markedly enhanced as the result of substantial shifts in affiliation.
Table 3 shows how the members raised

United States population as a whole. A 1955 Gallup poll found that only 4 per cent of all Americans reported a change in religious affiliation (Gallup, 1972). Moreover, of those NON members who changed, four out of five shifted to no formal religion--57 per cent became agnostics and 22 per cent became atheists.
NON members, then, do not have a strong commitment to religion. This fact is further shown in their frequency of attendance at religious services, with seven out

in each religion changed. (Because of the small numbers raised as atheists and in other religions, the changes of these individuals are not shown.) The most stable group was of agnostics, with two-thirds not changing. Jews were the second most stable group, with approximately threefifths not changing. Protestants were less stable, with two-fifths still identifying themselves as such. Catholics were the least stable, only 29 per cent remaining with the Church.
Perhaps the major distinction lies between Jews and agnostics, on the one hand, and Protestants and Catholics, on the other; the majority of the former did not change while the majority of the latter did. However, because the latter two groups were numerically larger, a majority of the entire membership (57 per cent) had changed from the religious orientation in which they were raised. This rate of change seems far larger than in the

of ten reporting that they "almost never" attend. Only 10 per cent said they attend "about once a week." By comparison, 40 per cent of the American population attends church weekly (The Gallup Organization, n.d.).
Several additional membership characteristics are of interest and may besummarized briefly:
1. There are slightly more females than males in NON. Forty-four per cent of the respondents were male, and 56 per cent were female. 2. The membership is almost exclusively Caucasian. Only 1 per cent of the respondents were nonwhite. The same was true of Zero Population Growth (Barnett, 1974). 3. About three-fourths of the members have belonged to the organization at least one year, and four out of ten reported being members 24 months or more, indicating more than a fleeting commitment. The median length of membership was 17.Smonths. 4. In response to thequestion, "Which of the following best describes your political orientation?", 18 per cent of the respondents selected the alternative "strongly liberal"; 46

The respondents appeared to have little doubt about the relative importance of these statements, since the statements constituted four of the five which were answered by at least 180 of the 185 respondents.

come, marital status, occupational status (measured by the scale developed by Nam et al., 197S), religion in which the respondents were raised, sex, and number of years married--we found only one to have a clear effect. This was number of years married (gamma = 0.48), with the incidence of "very important" declining from those married four years or less (94 per cent) to those married ten years or more (73 per cent).
"Adequately caring for and rearing a child is a heavy responsibility" was rated "very important" by the second-highest proportion (and "of no importance" by the second-lowest proportion). Examining the eight demographic variables, sex (F = 0.27 in a 2 x 3 table) and income (gamma = 0.14) were found to have an influence on responses to the statement. The rating of "very important" was more frequent among females (80 per cent) than males (54 per cent) and declined across five income categories from under $5,000 (75 per cent) to $20,000 and over (59 per cent).
"Having children intrudes on the relationship with your spouse" was considered "very important" by the third-highest proportion (and "of no importance" by the third-lowest proportion). Sex (F = 0.21 in a 2 X 3 table), age (gamma = 0.21), marital status (F = 0.29 in a 2 X 3 table), religion in which the respondent was raised (F = 0.14 in a 3 x 3 table), and number of years married (gamma = 0.15) affected responses to the statement. The proportion considering the statement "very important" was higher among females than males (71 versus 56 per cent); declined with age from under 25 years (79 per cent) to 30-34 years (60 per cent); was higher among those married and never divorced (68 per cent) than among those single and never married (50 per cent); was higher among those raised as Protestants and Catholics (67 and 68 per cent, respectively) than among those raised as Jews (42

per cent); and increased with number of years married from under 5 years (65 per cent) to 10 or more years (82 per cent).
"My spouse does not want children" was deemed "very important" by the fourth-highest proportion. Sex affected responses (F = 0.18 in a 2 x 3 table), with males considering the statement "very important" more often than females (66 versus 53 per cent).
The last statement rated "very important" by at least half of the respondents under 35 intending to remain childless was "rearing a child is financially expensive." Education (gamma = 0.22) and religion in which the respondent was raised (F = 0.11 in a 3 x 3 table) were related to responses to the statement. The incidence of "very important" ratings was higher among those with no college (62 per cent) and some college (68 per cent) than among those who had a bachelor's degree (43 per cent) or a graduate degree (44 per cent), and it was higher among those reared as Protestants (57 per cent) than among those reared as Catholics (47 per cent) and lowest among those reared as Jews (40 per cent).
Before turning to other aspects of the survey, let us look briefly at the other arguments where there were interesting effects by the demographic variables. "I simply do not like children" was related to education (gamma = 0.26), those with a graduate degree (12 per cent) being much less likely to rate it "very important" than those with no more than a bachelor's degree (30-35 per cent for bachelor's degree, some college, and no college).
"Rearing a child would interfere with my career" was related to sex (F = 0.34 in a 2 x 3 table) and to number of years married (gamma = 0.16). Females were more likely than males to rate the statement "very important" (52 versus 25 per cent), and those married ten or more years were less likely than those married five to

nine years or under five years (20, 45, and 44 per cent, respectively) to rate it "very important."
"Other parents don't seem to get that much satisfaction from having children" was related to sex (V = 0.12 in a 2 x 3 table), education (gamma = 0.16), and religion in which the respondent was raised (V = 0.18 in a 3 X 3 table). Females were more likely than males to rate the argument "very important" (33 versus 22 per cent). The incidence of "very important" declined as educational attainment increased (from 44 per cent among those with no college to 20 per cent among those with a graduate degree). Those reared as Jews (S per cent) were less likely to consider the statement "very important" than those raised as Catholics (30 per cent) or Protestants (35 per cent).
"Children reduce the happiness of marriage" was related to sex (V = 0.10 in a 2 x 3 table) and religion in which the respondent was raised (F = 0.22 in a 3 x 3 table). Females considered the statement "very important" more often than males (48 versus 38 per cent), and those reared as Jews (7 per cent) considered it "very important" less often than Catholics (44 per cent) or Protestants (SO per cent).
"I don't think I'd be a good parent" was related to age (gamma = 0.19) and to educational level (gamma = 0.37). The incidence of the "very important" rating declined with age, receiving the approval of SS per cent of those under age 25, 45 per cent of those ages 25-29, and 33 per cent of those ages 30-34.' It also declined with education, receiving the approval of 58 per cent of those with no college, 56 per cent of those with some college, 43 per cent of those with a bachelor's degree, and 21 per cent of those with a graduate degree.
Respondents who were planning to remain childless were asked about their parrents' knowledge of and attitude toward

their decision not to have children. The question was followed by the alternatives appearing in Table 6, which presents the distribution of responses by those under 35 years of age who intend to have no children. Altogether, 72 per cent of the respondents reported that their mother knew of the decision, and 65 per cent reported that their father knew. Mothers were almost twice as likely as fathers to know and to approve of the decision or to know and to have mixed feelings about it. On the other hand, fathers were over three times as likely as mothers to know of the decision but not to have indicated how they felt about it. There were some differences by sex, with V = 0.24 in a 2 X 9 table for the mother and with V = 0.28 in a 2 x 9 table for the father. With regard to mothers, females more than males reported that she knew and approved of the decision (25 versus 12 per cent), and males more than females reported that she knew of the decision but had not indicated how

We next turn to the pronatalist pressures experienced by NON members, continuing to confine our analysis to those under 35 years of age who intend to remain childless.

x 3 table) had an effect on responses. The proportion reporting that they encountered the argument "very often" was lower among those with a graduate degree (41 per cent) than among those with a bachelor's degree or less (where percentages ranged between 56 and 58). Members raised as Catholics reported encountering the argument "very often" more than those raised as Jews or Protestants (70, 55, and 45 per cent, respectively).
"You will be unhappy when you get older, especially after you retire, if you do not have children" was encountered "very often" by the second-highest proportion of respondents. Sex (V - 0.22 in a 2 X 3 table), age (gamma = 0.16), and the religion in which the respondent was raised(V = 0.10 in a 3 x 3 table) influenced the responses to this argument. Females were more likely than males to report encountering the argument "very often" (53 versus 37 per cent). The proportion of respondents reporting the argument "very often" declined with age, from 58 per cent among those under 25 to 42 per cent among those ages 30-34. Respondents reared as Catholics reported the argument "very often" more frequently than those

raised as Protestants or Jews (57, 41, and 40 per cent, respectively).
"You are intelligent and responsible and can raise the kind of person your country needs" was experienced "very often" by the third-largest proportion of respondents. Educational level (gamma = 0.32) had a bearing on responses, with the proportion reporting the argument "very often" increasing with education (from 19 per cent among those with no college to 44 per cent among those with a graduate degree).
"You'll never be a complete man or woman until you become a parent" was the last argument encountered "very often" by more than one out of four respondents. Sex affected responses (V = 0.21 in a 2 x 3 table), females being twice as likely as males to report the argument "very often" (37 versus 19 per cent).
One of the most notable aspects of the data in Table 7 is that only one argument was reported "very often" by half or more of the respondents arid only three by onethird or more. Formal pronatalist arguments thus do not appear to be an important feature of the pressures to have children experienced by two out of three NON

members, suggesting either that the pressures are manifested in more subtle nonverbal forms or that the intensity of the pressure is not great. Unfortunately, the questionnaire used in the survey did not include items with which to assess these possibilities.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
Members of the National Organization for Non-Parents possess a number of distinctive characteristics which should be emphasized. Members are generally young and married; only one in five was 35 years of age or older, and only one in five was single. The membership was almost entirely Caucasian, and its education and income (though education to a greater extent than income) exceeded that of the United States population as a whole. Members did not have a strong commitment to traditional, formal religion; three out of five had changed from the religion in which they were raised, and the vast majority of these individuals became atheists or agnostics. Members' achievements in education and income and their lack of commitment to religion suggest that their values differ markedly from those of the general population, a question studied elsewhere (Barnett and MacDonald, unpublished).
Members in their prime childbearing years (i.e., under 35) who were and intended to remain childless were examined on a number of characteristics relevant to their decision not to have children. The decision had been made a median of 4.1 years earlier. The most important reasons for the decision were reported to be the effect of children on personal indepen-

dence, the responsibility involved in rearing a child, the perceived interference of children with the marital relationship, opposition by the spouse to having children, and the financial expense of childrearing. The parents of the majority knew of the decision, but only a small minority of the parents approved of it, with females receiving the approval of their parents more often than males. Approximately two out of three reported experiencing pressures to have children, with the media, friends, and coworkers (but not parents) most often named as the leading sources. However, only two pronatalist arguments were encountered often by a majority or close to a majority: "It is selfish not to have children" and "you will be unhappy when you get older, especially after you retire, if you do not have children."
By way of conclusion, it is probably correct to state that the National Organization for Non-Parents represents the first organized attempt in history to challenge openly the strong pronatalist pressures in society. Sociological and psychological research on childlessness is scarce (Fawcett, 1970), in part because of the success of pronatalist pressures in suppressing voluntary childlessness (Veevers, 1974), and to the extent NON succeeds in increasing the incidence of the child-free life style, such research can be expected to become more common. However, members of social movement organizations such as NON undoubtedly differ from nonmembers having the same general goals (Hornback, 1974, Chap. 2), and thus the present study should add as much to research on social movements as to research on voluntary childlessness.
