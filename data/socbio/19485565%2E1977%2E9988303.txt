Income and Childlessness in Canada: A Further Examination

^ ill

ABSTRACT: The relationship between childlessness and income is investigated using 1971 Canadian census data. The rate of childlessness among rural French Catholics is used to represent the maximum rate of physiological childlessness. By using various residence and education groups, hypothesized relationships between income and voluntary and involuntary childlessness are tested. The findings support the suggestion that income is inversely related to involuntary childlessness and directly related to voluntary childlessness.

The relationship between childlessness and various socioeconomic variables is complex. It has been demonstrated that the distribution of family size without contraception is nearly a negative binomial distribution. However, the number of childless families has consistently been found to be greater than the expected number (Waller et al., 1973), which has led to the suggestion that childlessness stems from two different causes, one voluntary and the other involuntary.1 In other words, childlessness may be "due either to the deliberate decision to use birth control and/or abortion to prevent all births or to the sterility or subfecundity of

one or both of the marital pair" (Veevers, 1971, pp. 287-288). However, rarely are inquiries made of the woman as to whether she is deliberately remaining childless or if she is unable to conceive.2 One widely available data source which does not inquire about the causes of childlessness, and yet does contain a wealth of information pertaining to social and economic characteristics of the woman, is the census. The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationship between income and childlessness using census data and to demonstrate whether this relationship is different for involuntary than for voluntary childlessness.

1 Veevers (1972) differentiates three causes of childlessness: (a) physiological factors including specific physical abnormality or malfunction of the reproductive organs which lead to sterility of the husband and/or wife; (b) psychological factors which manifest themselves in two different ways, as (1) psychosomatic infertility where psychic tension, strain, or the intense desire to avoid parenthood apparently interferes with the reproductive process and (2) voluntary childlessness where there is a deliberate decision by the husband and/or wife not to have children and to use birth control and/or induced abortion to prevent any live births. Since in reality it is extremely problematic to separate the two manifestations of psychological factors, for the purpose of this paper a dichotomy of involuntary-voluntary will be used.

PREVIOUS STUDIES
Several studies have examined the relationship between income and childlessness. Using the April 1952 Current Population Survey, Grabill and Glick (1959) selected women 15 to 44 years of age who were currently married with husband present and who had urban or rural-nonfarm

Using the 1960 U.S. census, Kunz et al. (1973) further analyzed the relationship between husband's income and childlessness. In general, even after controlling for race, occupation, and education of the husband, they found an inverse relationship between income and childlessness. In their explanation of these findings, the authors emphasized involuntary childlessness. For example, high income women may find it easier than others to consult a doctor for problems during pregnancy, whereas a lack of prenatal care for low income women may result in more preg-

greater number of involuntarily than voluntarily childless women. In order to test this hypothesis, he chose a group of white women, 35^4 years of age, married once, who were wives of civilian household heads employed in nonfarm occupations. These women were married at age 22 years or later and were in the labor force. According to Poston, this group of women should have fairly high rates of voluntary childlessness. His analysis suggested that this was true, although his "findings were far from definitive confirmation of the hypothesis" (Poston, 1974, p. 306).

Poston (1974, p. 297) pointed out that "the bulk of the interpretation of the inverse relationship between income and childlessness does not admit the possibility that some couples may choose voluntarily to have no children." He suggested that perhaps voluntary childlessness had in general been ignored because it is "a state
