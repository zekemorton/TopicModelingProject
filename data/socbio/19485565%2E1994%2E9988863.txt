ABSTRACT: This paper investigates gender differences in the timing of ischemic heart disease (IHD) mortality among white Americans. Three age-at-death groupings are examined, using a model incorporating three types of independent variables: lifestyle, socioeconomic status, and biology/heredity. Logistic regression techniques are used to analyze National Mortality Followback Survey data. Three hypotheses drawn from the literature are tested: (1) that IHD mortality risks will vary by gender and across the life course; (2) that the independent variables will exert a lower mortality risk for women than for men at all ages of death; and (3) that differential risks by gender will be larger for younger age-at-death groups. Findings support the first and third hypotheses. The importance of research on gender differentials in age at IHD mortality in relation to parental heart-attack mortality, smoking and spousal smoking, occupation, and fertility is highlighted.

In the low mortality regimes of developed countries, women outlive men by a substantial, although variable, margin. The sex difference in life expectancy at birth in developed countries ranges from 9 years (in the former USSR) to 4.5 years (in Greece). In the United States the figure is 7.5 years (United Nations, 1988). Diseases of the circulatory system account for nearly one-half of the sex difference in life expectancy at birth, and ischemic heart disease (IHD) for approximately one-third. In addition, about 63 per cent of the increase in the sex mortality differential in the U.S. between 1900 and 1982 resulted from trends in death due to circulatory disease1 (United Nations, 1988). While differential life expectancy by sex has been decreasing within a number of age groups in North

America in the last decade (Gee and Veevers, 1988; Waldron, 1993), sex mortality differentials in deaths due to heart disease continue to remain substantial and, as yet, there are no indications of a narrowing (Waldron, 1993).
A combination of social, psychosocial, and biological factors--and their interactions--are considered to account for women's greater life expectancy in general (i.e., for all causes of death), although biological risks are considered to be of overall lesser importance (e.g., Koskenvuo et al., 1986; Verbrugge, 1985). A number of findings are well-established--for example, only a few causes of death (IHD, lung cancer, and deaths due to accidents/violence) are primarily responsible for the sex difference in longevity, and that about one-half of the sex differential in (adult) mortality in general and in IHD mortality specifi-

cally is attributable to smoking (Waldron, 1986a). Findings on other possible determinants of the sex difference in deaths due to IHD--such as the protective effect of female sex hormones (Kalin and Zumoff, 1990) and the role of Type A behavioral patterns (Barker et al., 1984; Waldron, 1986b)-are more ambiguous.
This paper investigates gender differences in mortality, but with a different focus than most research on the topic. Typically, efforts are directed toward establishing the factors that determine the magnitude of the sex mortality differential. We are less interested in accounting for the differential per se than in ascertaining if mortality determinants operate in the same way for female and male mortality across the life course. For example, are factors x, y, and z equally "risky" for men and women? And, do these differential risks vary with age at death? These questions are particularly relevant given the substantial changes occurring in the female gender role, such as shifts in labor-force participation and work-related stress.
Ultimately, all research on sex differentials in dying in developed countries seeks to answer the question: Why do women live longer than men? Without denying the complexities of attempting to answer this question, one finds research has not progressed significantly beyond broad generalities. In 1986, Waldron stated "much remains to be discovered about the multiple interacting causes of sex differences in mortality" (p. 74). While this statement is as true now as it was then, research on differential mortality in developed countries has, in recent years, shifted its focus away from

gender to social-class/socioeconomic differences.2
We suggest two reasons for the current "standstill" in the explication of mortality differences by gender. One is a looseness in the operationalization of the dependent variable. As pointed out by Pollard (1983), mortality rates and survivorship (or life expectancy or longevity) measure different aspects of death, although they are related in nontrivial ways. If one is attempting to explain or account for gender differences in longevity, the appropriate measure is one based on age at death (or years until death). However, researchers of sex differences in longevity sometimes use the rate of dying (i.e., women's lower mortality rates [for most causes of death]) as a proxy or equivalent measure (e.g., Harrison, 1978; Hoyenga and Hoyenga, 1979; Solomon, 1981; Sutherland et al., 1990). The linking of a mortality measure with its corresponding conceptualization of death is an important, albeit complicated, issue as inappropriate measures can lead to misleading conclusions.
A second reason is that limited research has been devoted to gender differences in cause-specific mortality risk factors. An exception is the work of Wingard and her colleagues (e.g., Wingard, 1982; Wingard et al., 1983). As noted by Waldron (1986ft), Wingard reports inconsistent findings across studies, attributable in part to
2A library search of research done in the past five years on mortality differentials in developed countries revealed a preponderance of work on socioeconomic differences. Examples include: Committee for International Cooperation in National Research in Demography, 1991; Mare, 1990; Marmot, 1989; Nolan, 1990; Wilkins et al., 1989; and Wing, 1988.

nonrepresentative samples. Another exception is research done as part of the Framingham Study. While the Framingham research has examined male and female risk for various types of heart disease and mortality, its biomedical framework often precludes the examination of social or lifestyle variables3--except smoking--and its focus is not on gender differences per se (e.g., Stokes, 1987). However, until we know about the possible "gendering" of risk factors (e.g., are smoking, low SES, etc., as "risky" for women as for men?), we will not progress in our understanding of gender differences in dying from IHD. An examination of risk factors is particularly important in IHD mortality, since gender differences in IHD prognosis are small (Waldron, 1986).
This research examines male-female differences in the timing of death due to IHD among white Americans. Specifically, we seek to ascertain if, and to what degree, the factors associated with dying from IHD earlier versus later in life are similar for men and women. As the concern is with explicating longevity (survivorship) differentials, our mortality measure, age at death, is appropriate. The data source used--the National Mortality Followback Survey (NMFS) (see following section)--contains a relatively large, representative sample and a number of independent variables for testing.
The choice to limit the investigation to one cause of death, IHD, is based on a number of considerations. One, we assume that different causes of death

(due to natural causes) have different configurations of causal variables; to include all causes of death, in an attempt to account for women's later age at death, is to chance obscuring effects that counterbalance one another. Two, heart disease is the major cause of death for both men and women in the United States; hence, findings related to this cause of death will be more explicative of the overall sex difference in longevity than those for any other natural cause of death. Three, heart disease has tended to be ignored by social scientists interested in sex differences in longevity and/or mortality (exceptions include Wingard et al., 1983; Johnson, 1977). The putative role of sex hormones in determining gender differences in heart disease mortality appears to have deterred nonbiological researchers from studying this cause of death. Four, research on predictors of death due to heart disease performed by biomedical researchers has tended to examine men only (exceptions include Schildkraut et al., 1989; Stokes et al., 1987), presumably because premature death due to heart disease is more common among men. As a result of three and four above, there is little research-informed knowledge about sex differences in age at death due to heart disease.
In attempting to account for age at death due to IHD for men and for women and, in particular, the degree of similarity or dissimilarity in the predictor variables by sex, we adopt a model containing three types of variables: lifestyle4 variables, socioeco-

fertility) will exert a lower IHD mortality risk for women than for men at all ages of death; and (3) differential risks by gender will be larger for younger ages of death. The first hypothesis is based on research suggesting that mortality risks vary by gender. The second hypothesis is guided by research that demonstrates no narrowing of sex mortality differentials due to IHD even in the face of decreasing gender differences in important mortality determinants such as smoking (Waldron, 1993). The third hypothesis is based on a general finding that the major risk factors predictive of cardiovascular mortality lessen with advancing age (Davis, 1990).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
SAMPLE CHARACTERISTICS
The data used are a subset drawn from the 1986 National Mortality Followback Survey (NMFS), conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services. The NMFS contains 18,733 records, gathered from the Current Mortality Sample (CMS), of resident U.S. adults aged 25 or more who died in 1986. The CMS comprises a systematic sample of 10 per cent of the death certificates from each state except Oregon. Oregon did not participate in the NMFS due to state legislation regarding consent of survey respondents. Washington, D.C., and New York City are also excluded, given separate death registration in those areas.
The NMFS links information taken from the death certificate with data obtained from an "informant" (a relative or close friend of the decedent), the

latter of which includes information about potential risk factors that may have contributed to the death. There are a total of 16,598 cases linking these two sources of information; and the response rate for the informant questionnaires was 89 per cent. Multiple causeof-death data were also linked to this data set, since 99.9 per cent of cases contained multiple cause-of-death information.
This study is based on cases in which IHD (ICD codes 412-414 [ninth rev.]) was indicated as the main cause of death on the death certificate and where race was reported as white on the death certificate and in the informant file. A small number of persons with inconsistent information on gender across the files were also removed. This results in a total unweighted sample of 2,955 IHD decedents; 1,656 men (56 per cent) and 1,299 women (44 per cent.)
MEASUREMENT OF DEPENDENT AND
INDEPENDENT VARIABLES
The dependent variable is age at death due to IHD, which indicates the timing of death due to ischemic heart disease. Since age-at-death data are sensitive to life cycle and cohort effects, our initial step involved dividing the IHD decedents into four age-atdeath groups: (1) those who died very young--25 to 44 years of age; (2) those who died during mid-life--45 to 64 years of age; (3) those who died as young elderly--65 to 79 years of age; and (4) those who died as old elderly --80 years of age and over. The number of IHD decedents in these four groups, by sex, is provided in Table 1. From these groups, three dichotomous dependent variables were developed to

facilitate analyses of: very young decedents; young decedents; and very old decedents. These include: (1) ages 25-44/remainder; (2) ages 25-64/ remainder; and (3) ages 80 + / remainder, respectively (see following sub-section on Data Analysis).
The operationalization of the nine independent variables is provided in Table 2, including the reference category for each variable for the logistic regressions (see following subsection). The operationalizations are straightforward, although some discussion of the SES measure (occupation) is warranted. Our preference is an education measure, as education is the single best SES indicator in relation to the risk of cardiovascular disease (Winkleby et al., 1992). However, the characteristics of our sample result in a negative relationship between age at death and education. Specifically, education is a co-variate of age at death. Age strongly affects level of completed education (a cohort effect) and level of education affects age at death. If we had data on survivors as well as dece-

dents, we could have performed an analysis (e.g., event history analysis, proportional hazards analysis) which would remove the potent cohort effects of educational attainment. As we lack such data, we are forced to adopt an SES measure, based on occupation of longest duration, that is less susceptible to cohort effects.
DATA ANALYSIS
Logistic regression techniques are used to investigate differences in the ability of the independent variables to predict the timing of IHD deaths in the lives of men and women. As indicated above, age at death due to IHD was dichotomized for the purpose of conducting logistic regression analyses of very young IHD decedents (ages 2544/remaining); young decedents; (ages 25-64/remaining); and very old decedents (ages 80+/remaining). In this way, we are comparing the independent variables across gender in their ability to predict dying from IHD very early (versus later), early (versus later), and very late (versus earlier) in life. A comparison between one of the two mid-age at death groups (i.e., ages 44-64 or 65-79) would prove problematic, since we would be combining ageat-death groups that are both younger and older than the middle age-at-death group.
Logistic regression is a multivariate technique that is well suited to predicting a binary dependent variable from a set of independent variables. It requires fewer assumptions than other models, such as discriminant analysis, that also attempt to estimate the probability that an event occurs. The logistic coefficient, its standard error, and odds ratio are presented. The logistic

coefficient can be interpreted as the change in the log odds of death due to IHD associated with a one-unit change in the independent variable. The odds of an event occurring (in this case, dying from IHD) are defined as the ratio of the probability that it will occur to the probability that it will not. When a coefficient is negative, the odds of dying from IHD are below one (even odds) but never reach zero; when a coefficient is positive, the odds ratio is above singularity. Goodness-of-fit chisquare is provided for the full models along with a test for statistical significance. If a chi-square is not statistically significant, it does not differ significantly from a "perfect" model using the independent variables in the model.
The independent variables that are not binary are grouped into three categories (except occupation; see below), with the middle one treated as the reference or contrast category. (The reference groups are indicated in Table 2. The coefficient for the reference category is zero.) The odds ratio for the first category of a variable indicates the change in log odds when comparing this category to the middle or contrast group. The same logic can be applied to the other contrast.
The occupation variable contains three categories for men and four for women. For women, a homemaker/ student category is added to the three variable classes that apply to both genders: blue collar/agriculture; white collar/service; and professional/managerial. The contrast group for both female and male decedents is white collar/service (see Table 2). The odds ratio is therefore interpreted as the probability of dying from IHD for a

specific occupational category compared to the white collar/service industry category.
DATA LIMITATIONS
A number of data limitations which can affect the results and their interpretation can be identified. One major concern is that all of the independent variables in the NMFS are obtained by proxy (i.e., informants or decedents). The information provided by proxies varies depending on the degree of closeness of the informant to the decedent and the ability of the respondent to recall information, some of which relates to events distant in time. Both affect the accuracy of the informant's information, which cannot be validated. Missing data is a related issue. Logistic regression allows only for the listwise deletion of missing data. Therefore, missing data are added to the contrast category group for multiple-category variables, and coded as zero for binary variables. This is the most conservative way of dealing with missing data and still retain sample size. A third concern is the absence of control groups, i.e., persons in the same age groups who are alive. The lack of information on both decedents and survivors does not allow for the elimination of cohort effects, as discussed in the measurement of our SES variable. Furthermore, predictors of age at IHD death may not necessarily correspond with predictors of survival.
RESULTS
Table 1 indicates the relationship between age at death due to IHD and gender in the NMFS sample. Nearly one-half of IHD male deaths occur at

118

ages under 65, whereas IHD deaths among women are concentrated at the older ages. The median age at death due to this cause differs by 11 years between men and women.
Given the association between IHD mortality and gender, results are discussed separately for the three age-atdeath groups. Within each group, the discussion is ordered so that the variables displaying the largest odds ratios (for women, men, or both) are discussed first.
IHD DECEDENTS AGED 25-44
For both men and women, the strongest predictor of very early versus later death due to IHD is parental death from a heart attack (see Table 3). This result confirms other studies reporting that parental death due to heart disease is a predictor of heart disease mortality for both sexes, particularly mortality at young ages (e.g., Schildkraut et al., 1989). However, the magnitude of the relationship for both men and women is striking. The odds ratio for women is more than double that for any other variable; for men, the odds ratio is larger than for heavy cigarette smoking.
The odds ratios and B's in Table 3 show the strength of a relationship while controlling for the other variables in the model. Therefore, at least some of the factors that could account for the relationship between parental death due to heart attack and IHD mortality through the transmission of family traits (such as smoking, drinking, obesity, a sedentary way of life, for example) are controlled, lending support to family heart disease mortality as an independent risk factor.

It is also important to note that the effect of family history (i.e., parental heart attack death) is sex-linked. That is, for women it is the heart attackdeath of the mother only and for men it is the heart attack-death of the father only that predicts early IHD death. This finding conflicts with Schildkraut et al. (1989), who report that the heart disease mortality of either parent is important for both sexes. As most studies examining the effect of family history of heart disease mortality have restricted their samples to men, it is not possible to reconcile these conflicting findings.
Compared to later IHD death, very early male IHD mortality is more likely to be affected by smoking than is very early female IHD mortality. Men display 2.23 times the risk of dying from IHD at ages 25-44 if they are heavy smokers in contrast to moderate smokers (the contrast group). For women of these ages, a risk exists as well, but it is smaller (1.33 odds) and not statistically significant. Similarly, men who do not smoke are somewhat less likely (0.86 odds) to die early from IHD than are moderate smokers. Women, on the other hand, are not protected from early IHD death through not smoking; the risk for nonsmokers is not statistically significant.
Overall, smoking is a significant risk factor for very early IHD mortality for men but not for women. It is not known whether this difference is due to a protective mechanism within women (possibly biologically-based) or whether it is due to differences in smoking styles/habits (e.g., men inhale more deeply, smoke closer to the filter, are less likely to smoke filtered cigarettes, etc.) (Waldron, 1986a).

data relating to spousal smoking provide a clue, however. Nonsmoking wives protect men from the risk (0.58) odds) of very early IHD mortality whereas heavy smoking wives are associated with only a small and not statistically significant risk for men. However, spousal smoking does not affect dying very young from IHD for women. This may be partly due to the low probability of IHD death for young women.
Occupation has no effect on early compared to later IHD mortality among men. On the other hand, young women are less than one-half as likely to die from IHD if they are blue collar or agricultural workers than if they are in white collar or service occupations

(the contrast group). Similarly, homemaking seems to exert a protective effect (0.57 odds) in comparison to the contrast category. With regard to fertility, women who have 4 or more children are one-half less likely to die from IHD at young ages compared with women with 1-3 children. Similarly, childlessness exerts a protective influence, although not to a statistically significant degree. (Since within-gender differences are not the focus of the analysis, issues concerning female work and fertility are not dealt with here but will be briefly highlighted in the Summary and Discussion section).
Heavy alcohol consumption increases the risk of early IHD death for both men (1.32 odds) and women (1.67

odds) compared to medium drinking, but the latter is not statistically significant due to a large standard error for the coefficient. A low level of drinking decreases the risk for both men and women to an approximately equal degree. Thus, these data do not support, for either sex, the research suggesting an association between lower mortality and moderate drinking (see BaumBaicker, 1985).
Persons with unacceptable body mass (either too fat or too thin) have a slightly elevated risk of dying very young rather than later in life from IHD, but statistical significance is not reached for either women or men. Regular exercise reduces the risk of very early IHD mortality for both men and women, compared to the contrast category (not very regular exercise). However, a sedentary lifestyle is also protective for both men and women. It appears that, at least for the risk of very early IHD mortality, irregular exercise is more "dangerous" than both much or very little exercise, and that this finding holds for both sexes.
IHD DECEDENTS AGED 25-64
Among this age grouping, which overlaps with the previous one, there are proportionately more women as the numbers of men and women dying from IHD in theolder segment (i.e., ages 45-64) are nearly equivalent (see Table 1).
The strongest predictor of the timing of IHD death is smoking. For women, heavy smokers are nearly 5 times more likely to die from IHD younger than older compared to moderate smokers. Among men, the risk is approximately 3 times higher. However, a protective effect of not smoking

compared to moderate smoking occurs for women only. Similarly, a nonsmoking spouse decreases the likelihood of dying from IHD before age 65 for both men and women (0.62 and 0.57 odds, respectively). However, it should be noted that the probabilities of dying from IHD younger rather than later in life due to heavy spousal smoking are in opposite directions for men and women, although neither of these associations is statistically significant. Thus, these data suggest that gender differences in the risk of dying young from IHD associated with smoking are complex. While heavy smoking is definitely a risk--although more for women than for men--the risk associated with spousal smoking and the protection of not smoking differ by sex and suggest that the deleterious effects of smoking (and passive smoking) need to be further examined.
Family history of heart attack again emerges as an important variable, although the results differ somewhat for this age grouping. Having either a mother or a father who died from a heart attack significantly affects the probability of dying earlier than later in life from IHD among women (2.84 and 2.22 odds, respectively). However, among men, only paternal heart attack significantly increases the risk of early IHD mortality (2.64 odds). These data suggest that research on the role of family history of heart attack as a determinant of early IHD mortality needs to pay greater attention to the "family transmission" of heart disease for women.
Men who are heavy drinkers have a higher likelihood of dying before rather than after age 65 from IHD than do moderate drinkers (1.67 odds), but

the association for women is not significant. A significantly decreased likelihood of IHD death associated with light drinking exists for both men and women (0.67 and 0.48 odds), again casting doubt on research findings that suggest that moderate drinking is the "healthiest" drinking behavior.
As with the previous age-at-death grouping, the occupation of men exerts no significant effect. On the other hand, and also as reported for the previous grouping, women are one-half (0.50 odds) as likely to die from IHD if they are in blue collar or agricultural work than if they are in white collar or service occupations (the contrast group). However, in this case, homemaking does not show a protective

effect. Regarding fertility, childless women are at less IHD mortality risk (0.54 odds) than women with 1-3 children.
While regular exercise has a small protective effect, slightly greater for women, the results are not significant. However, being sedentary has a statistically significant protective effect for both women (0.53 odds) and men (0.74 odds). As with the previous analysis, it appears that irregular exercise (the contrast group) is the least "healthy" behavior.
IHD DECEDENTS AGED 80 +
In turning to persons who die at very old ages, we are looking at the probability of dying from IHD late compared

122

Wister and Gee

Social Biology

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:46 08 December 2015

to earlier in life. Thus, the odds ratios in Table 5 are interpreted differently than in the two previous Tables. In Table 5, a high odds ratio indicates a protective effect, because now we are comparing the chances of dying from IHD late rather than earlier in life.
A striking feature of the regressions provided in Table 5 is the high degree of similarity between men and women. The magnitudes of the odds ratios for the independent variables for women and men are quite comparable (with one exception, spousal nonsmoking). This finding indicates that gender differences in the variables predictive of late compared to earlier IHD death are relatively small.
While heavy smoking is associated with a low likelihood of dying late from IHD (0.33 odds for men; 0.13 odds for women), again we see that nonsmoking does not significantly affect mortality chances (relative to moderate smoking, the contrast category). Having a spouse who does not smoke increases the chances of dying late for both men and women, but particularly for men for whom the odds ratio exceeds 4. However, a heavy smoking spouse is not a significant risk factor for either men or women. Again, we see that smoking is a complex phenomenon in relation to IHD mortality.
Parental death due to heart attack is a significant factor for both men and women, and is not sex-linked. As expected, the effect of parental heart attack death is to decrease the likelihood of dying from IHD at old ages rather than at younger ages. In other words, having a parent who died from a heart attack is associated with a greater likelihood of dying from IHD young rather than late in life.

Again, the effect of occupation is much stronger for women than for men. For men, being in a professional/ managerial job lowers the odds (0.66 odds ratio) of dying later than earlier in life from IHD relative to the contrast occupational group (white collar and service). For women, both being a homemaker and working in a blue collar or agricultural occupation more than double the odds of dying later rather than earlier from IHD (in comparison with white collar/service occupations). Similarly, for women, being childless significantly increases the odds (1.64 odds ratio) of dying at old ages.
Heavy drinking lowers the odds for both men (0.53 odds ratio) and women (0.60 odds ratio), although the effect is significant for men only. Light drinking increases the odds of dying later rather than earlier, approximately 1.5 times for both sexes, but is statistically significant for women only.
An unacceptable body mass lowers the odds of late IHD death for men (0.62 odds ratio) but not for women. For women, being sedentary doubles the odds of dying later rather than earlier from IHD. The other exercise relationships do not reach statistical significance.
SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
In general terms, the findings here indicate that the ranking of determinants of the timing of IHD death are: lifestyle factors (see footnote 4), biological factors, and, finally, socioeconomic factors. Our findings regarding the importance of smoking, spousal smoking, drinking and parental transmission of risk are in keeping with the

literature, although results here suggest complexities in the operation of variables that need further study. The lack of importance of occupation (for men) and the results associated with the fertility variable are unexpected findings that may have relevance for further research.
Turning to our specific hypotheses, the first hypothesis--that IHD mortality risks will vary by gender and across the life course--is supported. Also, we find that the magnitude of risk factors varies by gender. The second hypothesis--that the independent variables will exert a lower IHD risk for women than for men at all ages--is not supported. Together, these findings sug-

gest that the explication of gender differentials in the timing of mortality (at least regarding heart disease) depends upon models that incorporate different risks, and varying magnitude of those risks, by gender and age. At a minimum, considerations of female mortality need to include family history, fertility, and type of occupation, all variables that are rarely included. Also, the differential risks associated with smoking, spousal smoking, drinking, occupation, and exercise need to be accurately assessed. The third hypothesis--that differential risks by gender will be larger for younger ages at death--is supported. Reasons for this remain unclear and require further

exploration. However, it appears that many of the protective effects associated with being female diminish with age.
In addition to the support/refutation of specific hypotheses, our findings bear on a number of issues relevant to male-female differentials in mortality and survivorship. The role of family (i.e., parental) history of heart attack mortality, and its possible sex-linked characteristic, suggests an important avenue for research. It is important to add women to studies concerned with family history and heart-disease risk, particularly among young ages-atdeath groups. It should be noted, however, that since this analysis is based on only decedents of IHD, the effect of parental transmission may be magnified.
Findings regarding smoking and spousal smoking, and their differential effects by gender and age at death, illustrate the intricacies involved with the smoking variable(s). Given increases in female smoking, there is clearly a need for more refined research on the mortality consequences of smoking. These findings provide details as to why the relationship between increased female smoking and heart disease mortality rates remains ambiguous (Waldron, 1993).
Our results regarding gender, mortality, and occupation--specifically, that occupation plays a minor role in the timing of IHD mortality for men and a fairly important one for women --indicate another avenue of exploration. This finding conflicts with explanations of greater female longevity that focus on women's sheltered role in the home (Kotler, 1989). Indeed, these data provide little support for the pro-

tective effect of the homemaker role. Rather, they suggest that blue collar and agricultural jobs are the "healthiest" for women. This finding departs from that of Hazuda et al. (1986) who report that women employed in clerical and sales jobs are at the least risk of IHD, although their dependent variables were risk factors (e.g., cholesterol levels, body mass, blood pressure, glucose intolerance, smoking) rather than mortality. It may be that the effects of employment are mediated through family and work-setting variables. The findings here point to a factor (women's outside-the-home employment) that may increase mortality differentials by gender. Also, our findings show the importance of research focusing on variables associated with gender and work in relationship to mortality.
For the two female age-at-death groups for whom the childbearing years are complete, childlessness acts as an IHD mortality protector. The relationship between number of children ever-born and IHD mortality has been little-researched, but, if these findings are valid, they suggest another factor that could increase the gender differential in mortality, assuming that childlessness levels increase, as is predicted (Veevers, 1993).
It is clear that lifestyle factors play a leading role in the timing of IHD death and in accounting for some of the gender differences. However, the complexities of relationships, along with the role of social and economic factors in determining lifestyle behaviors, leave considerable uncertainty as to how health promotion initiatives could be tailored to meet the specific needs of women and men.
