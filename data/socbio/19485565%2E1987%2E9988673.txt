ABSTRACT: Among Canadian Mennonites whose ancestors left Flanders in the sixteenth century, one group separated as the Old Colony and part migrated in the 1920's from Canada to Mexico, where they constitute a large inbred isolate. In 1967, survey data including migration histories were collected on one-third of the households in one subdivision, the "M Colony." Church records were copied that gave vital statistics and surnames of almost all families in the Colony since the migration. Recent migration patterns show marriage restricted by distance and 37 per cent of resident married men remaining in their village of birth; but male migration history for those who migrate within the M Colony shows almost no effect of distance. Analysis of surnames gives an estimate of cumulative inbreeding of F = 0.0096, which is consistent with the individually estimated components, namely, founder effect, historical population constrictions, and slow genetic drift.

A population that excludes immigrants from reproduction is subject to breeding isolation and gradually becomes inbred; that is, it loses genetic diversity among individuals and heterozygosity within individuals. At the same time, through drift of gene frequencies, it diverges genetically from the ancestral population and from related populations.
Within an isolated population, or within a large population that is not isolated, subdivision may restrict migration and promote inbreeding within, and differentiation among, the subpopulations. Even in the absence of definite isolation or subdivision, space alone leads to isolation by distance and hence to local inbreeding and differentiation. The mathematical dependence of inbreeding on subdivision and on isolation by distance has been studied extensively (Wright, 1946; Malecot, 1948).
In a completely isolated population considered as a whole, the rate of in-

breeding depends on size or, more precisely, on effective population number (Wright, 1931; Kimura and Crow, 1963). Since population size may vary over time, numerical history of the population is important, particularly at times of population constriction. Size at the time of founding is the most important because then constriction is likely to be greatest and because all genetic variation in subsequent generations, neglecting mutation, is derived from members of the founding generation. This is commonly referred to as the founder effect.
The study of gene frequencies and genotypes in a population by bioassay methods such as blood typing (Morton et al., 1968) permits estimation of inbreeding and of divergence between populations on a large scale and over long spans of time for which pedigrees are lacking or unreliable. Nearly equivalent in human populations, and much more accessible, is the diversity of sur-

names and the frequency of isonymous marriages, i.e., marriages between persons of the same surname (Crow and Mange, 1965). This report presents migration and surname data from a human isolate and attempts to explain the inbreeding inferred from surnames in terms of numerical history and recent migration patterns.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
THE OLD COLONY
The human isolate which is the subject of this study is known as the Old Colony, a religious community with political subdivisions in Canada, Mexico, and some other Latin American countries. They show important similarities and contrasts to better-known isolates such as the Hutterites and the Old Order Amish. They have retained a Low German dialect and many features of the family-based agrarian culture inherited from their sixteenth-century ancestors of Belgium and Holland. In Chihuahua Province, Mexico, these people occupy sharply demarcated areas surrounded by contrasting Mexican peoples and cultures (Redekop, 1969; Sawatsky, 1971). In 1967 the Old Colonists in Chihuahua numbered 23,000 people by their own accounting, distributed in four geographically separated political subdivisions or settlements.
The short distances within a subdivision and the near limitation of marriage and migration, except emigration, to within its boundaries resemble conditions on a small island. Well-separated villages, apparently mapped with adequate precision, yield conveniently discrete distances. Pedigree information is limited to three or four generations, but

those generations are well documented in the church records.
Mennonites originated in Switzerland and in Holland in the sixteenth century, and during the Inquisition the Dutch Mennonites fled to eastern Europe. After long sojourns in Prussia and Russia, where numbers may have exceeded 150,000, about 7,000 migrated to Canada in the 1870's. There, around 1890, a conservative group called itself the Old Colony and separated from others who shared their history. In the 1920's about 6,000 of these Old Colonists, at least 2,000 married adults, moved to Mexico where they eventually formed about 15 settlements, chiefly in Chihuahua and Durango provinces (Redekop, 1969; Sawatsky, 1971). In Chihuahua Province, in addition to the four Old Colony settlements, there are other denominations of Mennonites, both conservative and relatively progressive. Judging from our data, there is no intermarriage between the Old Colony and the other Mennonites and very little between the Mexican Old Colonists and those who remained behind in Canada.
The largest of the four Old Colony subdivisions in Chihuahua, known as the Manitoba Plan or Manitoba Colony and the subject of the study, was 50 km. long and barely traversable in one day by horse-drawn vehicles. After 1962, however, the Manitoba Colony, hereafter abbreviated to M Colony, benefited from a paved central highway and a bus service which carried the colonists not only from one end of their subdivision to the other, but also into the partly surrounded Mexican town of Cuauhtemoc. At the time of our study, which fortuitously coincided with an official local "Land Survey" hereafter referred to as the Census, the population of the M

Colony comprised about 10,000 persons in 45 discrete villages on a tract of 230,000 acres (93,000 hectares).
DATA COLLECTION
This is the first publication of findings since a report on a 1966 pilot study (Allen and Redekop, 1967). The original research plan called for collection of demographic and psychosocial data on all households and monitoring of individual differences in survival and reproduction over the ensuing 15 or 20 years. A baseline census was planned and interviewers were recruited from the settlement to maximize acceptance and comprehension of the project. They employed a structured, pretested questionnaire designed to describe a complete household on the basis of direct interview.
Despite preparatory contacts with church leaders, confidence on the part of the community was not sufficient to permit completion of the census, and the result was an unplanned 35-percent "Sample Survey." The Survey nevertheless seemed sufficiently representative to justify analysis.
In the pilot phase we had photographed vital records in several villages, but these were both incomplete and overlapping. While the Survey was proceeding, the Deacon of the M Colony permitted our field worker, Kenneth Barkman, to photograph the central church record books documenting the approximately 3,500 families that have resided in the colony since its founding.
These two principal independent data sets, the Survey and the church records, were coded, placed on magnetic tape, and thoroughly edited, including for the church records comparison of information on many persons both as children and as heads of their own families.

From the 602 completed Survey records, 569 or 94 per cent were successfully matched to male heads of families in the church records for crossvalidation and correction.
A third source of information was the Land Survey or "Census" conducted by the church for the provincial government in 1967 and based largely on village records. The Census recognized 1,737 extant families, of which 620could be identified with families or parts of families in our Sample. The Census provided only four items: (1) family size, (2) cultivated land, (3) pasturage, and (4) head of cattle; but it served to document size and wealth of villages and, at the family level, to define some biases in the Sample Survey.
The migration data reported here were based on residence histories of the 569 male heads of household and their 558 living wives, including birthplace, first residence after marriage, and any other residence maintained for a year or more. Map distances between villages were available for the colonies in Chihuahua Province.

The unplanned sampling for the survey lent itself to evident biases, but these biases do not appear to be serious for the analysis of migration. An appearance of greater wealth in the Sample seems to be due to oversampling of larger, older families; larger villages were overrepresented both by inclusion (Table 1) and by completeness of enumeration. Fifteen villages were omitted and ten accounted for 67 per cent of the households in the Sample. Geographically, most of the omitted villages were in a nearly central area where we had not recruited a primary interviewer, but distances were not distorted; the mean of the 45 distances among ten bestenumerated villages, 17.6 km., was very similar to that of ten villages drawn at random, 18.2 km.
The analysis of surnames is based entirely on the church records, which were nearly complete for marriages. These included the names, birth dates and death dates of spouses, their date of marriage, birthdates of their children, and names of spouses' four parents including maiden names of both mothers. In many cases both spouses could be traced to their families of orientation, making available eight grandparents' names.
MIGRATION MODELS
We did not include group migration in the quantitative treatment. Migration between divisions of the Old Colony was analyzed mainly in terms of numbers of migrants, but migration within the M Colony was analyzed by numbers, years, and distance. The distance between birthplace of marriage partners, or "marital distance," is a useful measure of breeding isolation and was available for the Sample. A second quantity, parent-offspring distance or individual

migration per generation, measures gene-flow or dispersion, including group migration, and is given in our data by distance from birthplace of father to present residence of the family. There was relatively little movement after a family became established.
Although marital distance and individual migration must ultimately have the same consequences, they are not alike in their distributions. Here, only marital distance was found to fit the simple curvefor exponential decay (Morton and Yasuda, 1963):

m(x) = ce**,

(1)

where m(x) is the probability, among all marriages, that the distance is x, k is the reciprocal of the mean distance, and c is a constant. This is referred to as the aggregate distribution of marital distances (Harrison and Boyce, 1972). Rather different results could be expected from the average distribution, or after excluding village-endogamous marriages.
Both marital distance and individual migration were compared with expected random migration, i.e., mean distance among villages in the M Colony, a standard that is meaningful only in a geographically circumscribed population. We used a sample of villages, unweighted by size.

MEASURES OF VILLAGEENDOGAMY
An important component of average marital distance is marriage within village. The village endogamy rate is defined here as the proportion of married pairs in which partners share village of birth. Under random mating within a finite population, its expected value, Eo, is a function only of village size, AT,- and total population, N (counting Ni and N consistently, for example, as families). The expectation is simply the probabil-

170

ity of birth in a given village, squared to express co-occurrence, and summed over all villages:
Eo = 2(A^/A02 = S^,-2) / N2. (2)

A more appropriate formula for human populations with monogamy and overlapping generations counts the numbers of each sex:

Eo' =

(3)

where Mt and F, are numbers of males and females in the /* village; M and F are total males and females. Since age and marital state limit the available mates, the values of Mi, Fit M, and Fare the numbers of persons actually appearing in a cohort of iVmarriages, so that total males and females both equal N and the denominator of Formula (3) becomes N2.

ESTIMATION OF INBREEDING
On the assumption that in a small population each surname was introduced by a single founding family with parents unrelated to each other or to other families, names can be regarded as labels for genes inherited with them. The importance of these assumptions is considered in the Discussion.
Crow and Mange (1965) formulated methods for inferring population levels of inbreeding from the frequency of "isonymy" (marriage between persons of the same surname) and from the frequency distribution of names in the population. The probability of isonymous marriage under random mating, Pr, is given by
Pr = = 2m.Fi, (4)
resembling Formula (3), but where M, and Ft axe the numbers of males and females with the /th surname; «i, and/ are

the respective proportions within sex. The coefficient of kinship between two related persons is the probability that two homologous genes selected from them randomly will be derived from the same ancestral gene; for parent and child or for sibs, <>j = 0.25. The average coefficient of kinship in the population is estimated as one-fourth of Pr:
(5)

Average kinship (<()) and frequency of consanguineous marriage in one generation are algebraically related to inbreeding in the succeeding generation. Total inbreeding, F, can be usefully partitioned into random and nonrandom (i.e., deviation from random) components, Fr and Fn (Allen, 1965; Crow and Mange, 1965). When the observed frequency of isonymous marriages, P, is not significantly different from the random value, Pr, the nonrandom components of isonymy and inbreeding are insignificant, but Pr and P, both divided by four, estimate Fr (~ <j>) and F, respectively. A nearly equivalent method is used here, as recommended by Crow (1980) for old isolates, at least if the nonrandom component is significant. One starts with the formula,

Pn = (P-Pry(l-Pr),

(6)

where P is the observed proportion of isonymous marriages and Pr is the proportion expected under random mating within the given cohort, estimated by Formula (4). Fr and Fn are estimated as 1U of PT and Pn, and when substituted into Formula (7), they yield an estimate of total inbreeding:

The effect of genetic drift is often largest in the first generation of a new isolate, when it is known as the founder effect, as noted in the introduction. At that point, the coefficient of kinship takes an initial value, <f>0, which remains the lower limit for subsequent generations, barring immigration. If there are n founding families and 2n founding parents, the numerator in (5) is Imfi = n(\l n)2 = \ln, so from (5)

= 11 An.

(8)

In terms of genes, if there are 2n unrelated founding parents, the population starts with An haploid sets of chromosomes; An unrelated copies of each gene. In subsequent generations <)>, the probability of two random genes being identical by descent, is at least <f>o and increases as some of the Angenes are lost. Similarly, as names are lost, estimates of (|>o based on remaining names will be larger than the true founder effect. The value of 4> from (5) increases even more because loss of some names and drift of frequencies tend to eliminate smaller terms and increase larger ones. Conversely, immigration enlarges both n and the gene pool and reduces <J>.
Having access to four parental surnames of nearly all couples in the church records should permit detection of all first-cousin marriages instead of onefourth of them as with spouses' names, but verification of cousinhood requires identification of the isonymous grandparental pair or pairs by birthdates or at least by first names. When parental rather than spousal names are used in a modification of (4), they appear to add information about kinship (PintoCisternas et al., 1985; Allen, in press).

Here we have used parental isonymy (identity of surnames between either parent of the husband and either parent of the wife) only as a screening device in searching for actual consanguinity and to test quantitatively for any relation of apparent inbreeding to marital distance.
RESULTS
MIGRATION
Immigration to the M Colony is summarized in Table 2. Canadian-born adults in the Sample are all regarded as founders; 99 per cent arrived before 1931. Fifty-three Mexican-born adults are definite immigrants to the M Colony, but they all appear to have been members of the Old Colony and none contributed a unique surname.
Emigration from the M Colony was estimated from the reports of absent living sibs collected from the men and women in the Sample. Among 2,674 living full sibs of those born outside the M Colony, mainly in Canada, 829 or 31 per cent were reported to be in other Old Colony settlements and 374 more, 14 per cent, were no longer counted in the Old Colony, resulting in total emigration of 45 per cent. Of 4,776 sibs of men and women born in the M Colony, many were not yet married and the proportion of emigrants was smaller, totaling 23 per cent.
Migration within the M Colony can be considered in three categories: (1) individual migration, (2) marital distance, and (3) village endogamy.
Migration distances reported by men who were born in the M Colony are shown in Table 3. Men were counted as nonmigrants for a given interval if they

were in the same village at start and finishof the interval: birth to marriage (i.e., to first marital residence), marriage to Survey date, or birth to Survey date ("net migration").
Table 3 shows a regular decrease over time in the migration distances of migrants and in the proportion migrating after marriage. In all three decades, fewer men moved after marriage than before, and for actual migrations, mean distance moved after marriage was only about half as great as mean distance moved before marriage. The average numberof postmarital moves, not in the

table, decreased with time from 1.91 for marriages before 1922, which included the group migration from Canada, to 0.44 for marriages in the last 7 years before the Survey. For the intervening decades the average was nearly constant: 1.00, 1.08, and 0.95. It thus appears that postmarital migration, excepting group migration, is largely confined to the first 3 or 4 years after marriage.
Migration before marriage, i.e., from birthplace to first residence after marriage, was more frequent for women than for men. Of 569 men, 171or 30 per

les in a geographically stable population are expected to show an elevated rate of village endogamy and a reduced average marital distance. From the data, endogamy was not elevated; average marital distance was reduced, but not significantly so.
DISCUSSION
The present data illustrate the genetic consequences of strict religious isolation and geographic subdivision in inbreeding units similar to, but much larger than, those found among the Hutterites (Steinberg et al., 1967). The subpopulation discussed here contained over two thousand adults instead of around a hundred. Genetic drift in a population this size is expected to be very slow, but our analysis of names and isonymy provides evidence of substantial change associated with division and migration. The number of husband and wife surnames dropped from 79 in recorded marriages of men born before migration to Mexico to 66 for men born after the migration, and five of the lost names were those of women born around or before separation of the Old Colony from other Mennonites; apparently their male sibs did not join. Both observed and expected isonymy between spouses increased in marriages of men born after migration, though not significantly. A similar increase occurred, of course, in the derived coefficientof kinship.
The increase of inbreeding fails to reach statistical significance, as expected for a random process. By definition, genetic drift and founder effects result only from the operation of chance. The value of 145 for contingency Chi26i, contrasting the distributions of surnames before and after mi-

gration, would be very highly significant if accepted at face value, but it is not a valid test of statistical significance because individual "trials" are not independent; each cohort contains blocks of relatives, including large sibships. Therein lies an important element of genetic drift and of the founder effect. Statistical significance is not expected in one generation, but because direction of change is determined by binomial sampling, significance is eventually attained.
It is doubtful if the founding population satisfied the requirements that all families should have different names and be unrelated. However, discrepancies of these two types tend to offset each other in estimating the contribution of founder effect to present inbreeding, and at worst they impair precision in defining the generation when inbreeding began. The assumptions are not needed for estimating changes in inbreeding over time.
Since many early names undoubtedly died out and are not seen in our records, the minimum coefficient of kinship, (j>o, as estimated by Formula (8) from observed surnames, is a combination of the true founder effect and subsequent loss of surnames accompanying incremental genetic drift to 1890. With 107 known ancestral names (103 from the church records and 4 others from the Survey and village records), the maximal founder effect is 0.0023. Additional inbreeding is expressed in recent loss of surnames and in the unequal distribution of surviving names, 0.0096 - 0.0023 = 0.0073.
Next to the founder effect, the portion of the inbreeding that can be best estimated is that associated with the four historical migrations. The move from Canada to Mexico appears to have in-

creased the kinship coefficient by 0.001. At least two of the earlier mass migrations involved similar numbers (Sawatsky, 1971), so that four increments of nearly this magnitude may have contributed 0.004 to the observed inbreeding:

The remainder should be explainable as gradual genetic drift. Through most of its history, the Mennonite population has been, by report, so large that the random inbreeding effect would be small. The increase in inbreeding is V2Ne (Ne is the effective population number) per generation (Crow and Kimura, 1970). The Old Colony population in Chihuahua Province exceeded 20,000 in 1967, one-fourth of them reproductive-age adults. An effective population number of 5,000 over 16 generations would add only 0.0016 to the inbreeding, so it appears that either the harmonic mean number has been much smaller, or the estimated total, 0.0096, is inflated, as expected if several names occurred in two or more founding families. A more detailed analysis is found elsewhere (Allen, in press).
The population constriction associated with migration from Canada, 0.001, is four times that expected in one generation of 2,000, the estimated number of married reproductive adults who migrated from Canada. Inclusion of large blocks of adult full sibs and adult first cousins in that number would require a downward correction of the number. This would not be sufficient (Crow and Kimura, 1970) under the assumption of a mean progeny number of

two, but that assumption does not apply to this expanding population.
Isolation by distance is seen, first, in immigration, which is inversely related to distance between colonies: the Survey found 43,7, and 0 migrants from the other three colonies in Chihuahua Province. Second, the village boundary is a strong barrier; 37 per cent of the married men born in Mexico still live in the village where they were born and 14 per cent of married couples were both born in the same village. The second figure is over four times that expected under random pairing.
The average male migration distance within the colony is nearly equal to the average distance between villages selected at random, but this must be interpreted in the light of a high rate of outmigration, possibly as high as 45 per cent. Apparently a strong distance effect is outweighed within the colony by pressure to migrate. The fit of marital distance to an exponential decay curve and failure of fit for migration distances of individuals or couples appear to depend on the proportion of nonmigrants, not on the relation between mean distance and dimensions of the colony.
Individual net migration history and marital distance differ sharply in distribution curves, in proportion of migrants, and in mean distance. The explanation appears to be that these are almost independent phenomena in this population and perhaps in others (Harrison and Boyce, 1972). The curve of individual migration differs from exponential decay because of a high frequency of no migration and a nearly flat frequency distribution for actual migration distances, as in some other studies (e.g., Cavalli-Sforza et al., 1964). If a man can obtain a farm in his own or his new wife's village, he generally will set-

tance andpostmarital migration show significant decline in successive cohorts. One apparent explanation isincreasing population density, which would increase the number ofavailable mates in near villages, encourage emigration, and impede relocation within the M Colony. Another factor could be the erosion over time of family and friendship ties that spanned the Old Colony more widely just after migration to Mexico.

The M Colony shows an inbreeding increment of 0.001 after the migration to Mexico in the 1920's, four times that expected from the number of migrants. The discrepancy may be dueto large blocks of sibs in an expanding population. Contingency Chi2 appears tobe a useful instrument for specifying this population structure inthe comparison of surname distributions of persons born before and after the migration.
