The Samaritans today are a small group of some four hundred individuals. Their current demography was reported by Bonne (1963). They trace their ancestry over a period of more than two thousand years from the biblical Samaritans, a religious sect that broke away from the main stream of Judaism about the fifth century B.C. AS an independent nation, they enjoyed their greatest expansion in numbers and significance during the Roman Empire, and large Samaritan settlements were later found in various localities in the Middle East. With the coming of the Byzantine Christian rule and its Islamic successor, there was a period of exile, persecution, and gradual decline in numbers and influence. Finally, the colonies disappeared, and the center of the community continued to survive only in Shechem (Nablus) where in the last century the number of Samaritans declined to fewer than ISO individuals. Nonetheless, as throughout the whole of their history, they remained preferentially endogamous.
At the beginning of this century, the impending extinction of the population was predicted, but a general increase in numbers occurred. In the early 1930's there was a slow migration of several families from Shechem to Jaffa (Palestine) which resulted

in the present division of the population into two groups, one living in Nablus, Jordan, and the other in Cholon, Israel. In 1948 political events separated the two groups geographically and socially from each other, except for several days each year during the Passover when all members of the two communities join for a pilgrimage to Mount Gerizim, their holy mountain and center of worship.
In 1933 Gini drew attention to the high abortion rate among women of the small Samaritan community. He wrote (p. 127):
The striking characteristic of the reproductive life of the Samaritans is the high frequency of abortions, in contrast to the rarity of stillbirths and the moderate frequency of premature deliveries. The abortions are not due to venereal disease, for this is said not to exist among the Samaritans; our investigations exclude the possibility that they are due to excessive toil on the part of women during pregnancy. In some cases they appear to be connected with malaria, but for the majority this does not appear to be a plausible reason. . . . it is highly probable that here is an effect of the strict and prolonged consanguinity which, as is well known, results in the uncovering of the action of lethal factors. Very high also appears infant mortality in both sexes and particularly in males.
To these high frequencies of abortions and infant deaths has been attributed the dim-

inution in numbers of the Samaritans that has progressively occurred over the centuries, despite the fact that recently they have had better health conditions than those of surrounding populations.
For this small population, then, there was a report of a high abortion rate, a suggestion that it was related to inbreeding, and the speculation that it may have been characteristic of this population for a long period. It was of obvious interest to investigate the reproductive history of Samaritan women to verify Gini's observation and, if confirmed, to examine his interpretation.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
From 1960 on Dr. Bonne worked in the Samaritan community in Israel and established good rapport. This personal contact was extended in 1963 through informants and correspondents to the Samaritan women living in Jordan to whom no direct access was possible until 1967. Over this protracted period, the details of the reproductive histories of the women were acquired. The accuracy of the reporting is believed to be very high, for apart from the personal acquaintanceship, it is customary among the Samaritans for the domestic activities of the woman to be affected by her position in the menstrual cycle. Thus, it is possible to cross-check personal information in a way impossible in many other populations. The information here analyzed relates to the situation at the end of 1963.
For every woman details were recorded of her present age and the duration of her marriage or marriages. From this information, the period at risk of pregnancy was calculated. The menopause was taken to occur at the age of 45 years, and in the case of a woman above this age the period at risk was taken as having terminated then. Marriages of less than one year's duration were excluded from the calculations. For each woman, pregnancies were listed

and the outcome identified. From the nature of the data it was possible to identify "pregnancies" when only one period had been missed; but for purposes of this analysis a pregnancy was only taken as such when two periods were missed. For each woman, the number of pregnancies, the number of abortions and stillbirths, the number of live births, and the number of children surviving and the ages at death of those who did not were tabulated. The number of pregnancies, live births, etc., per fertile year of marriage were estimated as the ratio of the total number of pregnancies, live births, etc., to the total number of fertile years of marriage. The proportion of miscarriages was estimated as the ratio of the total number of miscarriages to the total number of pregnancies, and the proportion of children dying as the ratio to the total number of children born.
RESULTS
REPRODUCTION
The reproductive experiences for the Israel and Jordan groups are generally similar (Table 1 ). Details are available for the total population, 80 women involved in 84 unions. Four unions of duration greater than 2 years (12 years and 3 years in Israel, 7 years and 6 years in Jordan) had proved sterile; a fifth of 8 years was unproductive, although the woman was fertile in a subsequent marriage. Altogether, these unions had resulted in 457 pregnancies, 59% of which occurred in the Jordan group. There were 9 twin pregnancies, so that 466 individuals in all were conceived. There were 5 current pregnancies, leaving 461 individual conceptuses whose fate could be analyzed. The number that had aborted or were stillborn was 117, a very high total, representing one quarter of all individuals conceived; moreover, the proportion is similar in both Israel and Jordan (27% and 24%). Of the 344 live births, only 271

survived to adulthood or are still surviving as children. There is significantly (0.02 > P > 0.01) better survival in the Jordan than in the Israel communities.
The greater number of pregnancies in the Jordan community is due to the greater duration of unions and accompanying years of pregnancy risk. The number of pregnancies per fertile year of marriage is very similar in the two groups as is the number of live births per fertile year of marriage, since the proportion of abortions to number of conceptions is also very similar in the two communities. The number of surviving offspring per fertile year of marriage, and the proportion of children surviving per live birth both remain greater in the Jordan community. There are few data with which these rates can be compared. The overall number of pregnancies per fertile year of marriage (0.34) is very similar to that (0.33) in 93 unions uncomplicated by abnormal hemoglobin in either spouse in a West African survey among the Yoruba and neighboring peoples practising no contraception (Roberts and Boyo, 1960). The proportion of Samaritan abortions (overall,

0.25) is nearly twice as high as the Nigerian sample (0.14) and thus accounts for the lower number of live births per fertile year of marriage (overall, 0.2 S ) in the Samaritan than in the Nigerian sample (0.29). The difference in live birth frequency remains when allowance by weighting is made for the bias due to the concentration of births in the earlier years of marriage, with an increase in variance with duration of marriage.
Examining the Israel community in more detail, those abortions whose date by month of pregnancy can be definitely stated show a distinct bimodal distribution. The majority occur in the earlier months of pregnancy (third, fourth, and fifth) ; there is a distinct antimode in the sixth and seventh months of pregnancy, and a second mode in the eighth and ninth, the losses rising to a peak with the number that occur at or near term, stillbirths, etc.
RELATION TO INBREEDING
Bonne (1963), examining all living individuals born to those married after 1932, calculated the mean inbreeding coefficient

of inbred individuals in the Israel community to be 0.05S and of the whole generation in the Israel community to be 0.043. The calculations were subsequently extended (Bonne, unpublished) to cover Samaritans in both communities and included all 381 Samaritans who were living in 1964 and 174 of their known ancestors. The pedigree depth over which the inbreeding coefficients were calculated varied from individual to individual, and in view of the long history of inbreeding in the Samaritan community, all the results are to be regarded as minimal for any individual. There is no base line population against which comparison can be made. Nonetheless, there are some high inbreeding coefficients. There were 82 individuals for whom F = 0, 41 in Jordan and 41 in Israel, from unions with nonSamaritans. The other 299 exhibited some degree of inbreeding, with a coefficient ranging from 0.006 to 0.135; of these, 47% have an inbreeding coefficient of 0.0625 or higher. The mean value of F for inbred individuals in Jordan is 0.061 and in the Israel community, 0.055. The mean coefficient of inbreeding for the total Samaritan sect is 0.046 for the total population, and 0.059 for inbred individuals only. In the last generation, born to parents married after 1938, there are 123 offspring from 42 fertile marriages, for whom the mean inbreeding coefficient is 0.069; in the Jordan representatives of this generation, it is 0.074.
Despite the bias involved in using incomplete pedigrees for calculations of inbreeding and genetic load (Spuhler and Kluckhohn, 1953; Roberts 1969), it appeared of interest to examine the Samaritan abortion and survival data in terms of their inbreeding. Of the nonproductive unions of sufficient length to be regarded as sterile, the coefficients of relationship of the spouses were all positive, ranging from 0.042 to 0.156 with a mean of 0.096. These unions were excluded from the subsequent anal-

ysis. The data showing the number of losses antenatally and postnatally for the Samaritan communities of Israel and Jordan are given in Table 2, according to the inbreeding coefficient of the individuals conceived. Inspection suggests no clear trends with inbreeding category in either community. Perhaps in Israel there may possibly be an indistinct trend with increasing consanguinity to a greater proportion of antenatal losses, and in Jordan a faint trend in the opposite direction. Comparing the Israel and Jordan groups, there is no significant difference between them in the proportions of antenatal losses in the first four inbreeding categories in Table 2, but the difference is highly significant in the most inbred category. It appeared worthwhile to look more closely at the regressions on consanguinity.
Calculation of the A and B values for the weighted regressions on inbreeding coefficients gives the results shown in Table 3. For abortions and stillbirths, the Israel figures do indeed show a positive value for B, and the Jordan, a negative. However, compared against their standard errors, neither regression coefficient differs significantly from zero, and the regression coefficients in the two subsamples do not differ significantly from each other (F = 1.17 with 1 and 37 degrees of freedom). The two values of A are both significant and very similar to each other. The two subsamples may therefore be pooled, and the estimates of B and A for the total Samaritan population is given in the final column of Table 3. Again, although the regression coefficient is negative, it is less than oneand-a-half times its standard error. Similar calculations were carried out for deaths between birth and 2 years of age, and for deaths between birth and 15 years of age. The values of the variance ratio are respectively 0.74 and 0.40, so again the two subsamples are pooled to give the overall values in the final column of Table 3. Thus,

there is no evidence that within the Samaritans increased consanguinity gives rise to increased antenatal or postnatal loss, and indeed there is a slight suggestion that the trend may be in the opposite direction --that increased consanguinity reduces antenatal loss.
It could be hypothesized that the level of homozygosity in the mother, and not in

the fetus, is responsible for fetal loss. This hypothesis was tested by examination of the weighted regression of proportion of abortions on the inbreeding coefficient of the mother instead of on the offspring in the two subsamples combined. Again, the value of B is negative, but not significantly different from zero (B = --1.26S ± 0.888, A = 0.304 ± 0 . 0 4 8 ) , so that it appears

that maternal inbreeding does not increase fetal loss.
DISCUSSION
This study has confirmed the reported high antenatal loss in Samaritans and has also demonstrated moderate postnatal loss. However, the results give no suggestion that within this community the high antenatal loss is positively associated with the consanguinity of unions or the degree of maternal autosomal inbreeding and indeed suggests rather the reverse. Similarly, consanguinity does not appear to exaggerate postnatal loss, but again rather the reverse. The two sections of the community do not differ significantly in the relationship of their antenatal loss to inbreeding, nor would they be expected to, since they were so recently a whole and they continued to intermarry despite the political separation, a practice that has increased since 1967.
Of the possible explanations for the results, one is that inbreeding has continued for so long in the Samaritans that the inbreeding coefficients used in this study, which except for the noninbred were minimal, in fact do not reflect adequately the differing probabilities of identical homozygosity in any conceptus in the population. Another possible explanation depends on the interpretation of the final regression coefficient, whether in fact it is zero, or whether it is negative; for this, further information over the next few years is required. If it proves negative, then it is possible that there may have been an adaptation to inbreeding, i.e., inbreeding has been going on so long that any deleterious genes producing abortions have been bred out, as suggested by Darlington (1960, 1961). If this is so, then one might expect to find still higher levels of abortion in other less inbred Middle Eastern communities. Data are as yet not available.
Perhaps homozygosity has no effect on

abortion. Fraser (1962) made a careful appraisal of the existing data on abortion and inbreeding. These data may not be entirely satisfactory since they relate to detected abortions and do not include early undetected embryonic deaths. He noted in Slatis, Reis, and Hoehne's study (1958) that even though abortions represented a contribution of 0.52 lethal equivalents, the actual numbers of abortions in consanguineous and control matings were very similar (e.g., 36 out of 248 pregnancies in consanguineous unions as compared with 34.2 expected on the null hypothesis). The preliminary analyses of Schull (1958) and Morton (1958) of Japanese data showed that inbreeding had no effect on the interval between marriage and first birth; thus, there was no evidence for an important recessive lethal component acting at the early zygote stage. Moreover, inbreeding had no effect on sex ratio, and therefore there was no evidence of sex-linked lethals acting in utero. However, there is a marked inbreeding effect on stillbirth and neonatal deaths. Goldschmidt et al. (1961) showed fewer abortions among consanguineous unions in Kurdish Jews, and Book (1957) similarly observed a negative effect. Freire-Maia, Freire-Maia, and Quelce-Salgado (1961) found in Brazilian whites a small increase in stillbirths and decrease in abortions in consanguineous unions and a greater increase in both Brazilian Negroes. Sutter (1958) in France and Yanase, Masuda, and Fujiki in Japan (cited in Schull and Neel, 1965) observed an increased proportion of stillbirths with increasing consanguinity.
Taking another approach, Stevenson and Warnock (1959) found no increase in consanguinity of the parents in a series of abortions in Belfast as compared with the normal population; in the present data also the mean inbreeding coefficients of women who have aborted at least once

70

(0.039) and those who have not (0.03S) are similar. Fraser (1962, p. 414) concluded, "there is therefore no reason to suppose that recessive lethal genes are operative prenatally to any extent in man . . . unless indeed they are so common that no increase in consanguinity amongst the parents is to be expected. This is rather unlikely." The present results are compatible with this conclusion.
