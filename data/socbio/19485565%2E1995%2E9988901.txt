ABSTRACT: In sub-Saharan Africa, the majority of fertility and family planning studies are of women. By ignoring men, these studies overlook the primary fertility and family decision makers. This study uses male data from Cameroon to examine how currently monogamous men make fertility and nuptial decisions. Three analyses are discussed. First, an analysis of monogamous men's desire for additional wives is presented. Second, an analysis of monogamous men's desire for additional children is presented. Finally, the two desires are examined simultaneously to disentangle the relationship between these two family desires. Three possible interrelationships between monogamous men's two family desires (desire for wives and desire for children) are examined and discussed. The results indicate that men's desire for more children drives their desire for additional wives and not the contrary. The implications of this finding for high fertility in areas where polygyny is common are discussed.

Men are the primary fertility decision-makers in Africa (IsiugoAbanihe, 1994) but are rarely the focus of fertility and family planning research (Adamchak and Mbizvo, 1991). Studies of men are needed (1) to assess how men make fertility decisions and to determine the factors associated with family planning use among men; (2) to examine if men's fertility desires are linked to other family desires (e.g., polygyny); (3) to determine if men's fertility desires are changing; and (4) to ascertain if men are women's barrier to family planning use. This paper focuses on the second of these research areas. In particular, I study men's two-family desires, desire for multiple wives and desire for many children, and the link between them.
Men's desire for multiple wives (polygyny) is of interest to potential fertility transitions because, where polygyny is common, women may be less likely to act on their own changing fer-

tility desires. Two examples make this clear. In the first case, a woman who no longer wants children may continue reproducing to avoid her husband's taking another wife for reproductive purposes (a fear or dislike of polygyny) (Fapohunda and Todaro, 1988). In the second case, a woman in a polygynous union who no longer wants children may Continue reproducing to compete for valued male resources gained by having children (Adewuyi, 1987). Therefore, where polygyny is common, women who no longer want children may not adopt family planning because bearing children remains their only way to influence union type and gain economic resources.
The decision to become polygynous is predominantly the man's in subSaharan Africa. Some reasons men choose to be in polygynous unions are (1) to gain prestige and status by having multiple wives (Ahmed, 1986; Ukaegbu, 1977); (2) to acquire

additional agricultural labor through wives and their children (Ukaegbu, 1977); (3) to have additional sexual partners while one wife is abstaining because of breastfeeding (van de Walle and van de Walle, 1989); and (4) to have another woman available to reproduce, especially if the first wife is infertile (Dorjahn, 1958).
The second family desire I examine is men's desire for additional children. As men's fertility desires decline, it is hypothesized that fertility levels will subsequently decline, assuming fertility desires are communicated to wives and that family planning is acceptable, available, and affordable.
In sub-Saharan Africa, the decision to have children is predominantly the man's (Fapohunda and Todaro, 1988; Lee and Bulatao, 1983). Some reasons that men (and women) want many children in sub-Saharan Africa are that children are viewed as an investment in the future for financial security (Caldwell, 1983); children offer additional labor for agricultural work (Acsadi and Johnson-Acsadi, 1990); and having many children gains prestige and status in the community (Isiugo-Abanihe, 1994).
Previous research on African men has found that men in polygynous unions are more likely to desire additional children than men in monogamous unions (e.g., Adamchak and Adebayo, 1987; Isiugo-Abanihe, 1994). What is unclear from this finding is the direction of causality between men's desire for children and their desire for multiple wives. Do men in polygynous unions want more children to satisfy the childbearing needs of their multiple wives? Do men who want

many children take additional wives to attain reproductive goals? Or, do some men want both wives and children based on an underlying desire for large families (e.g., a need for the additional labor of wives and children)?
Although the situations above sound similar (polygyny leads to desire for children, desire for children leads to polygyny, or both desires act simultaneously), they have different implications for the future of a fertility decline in sub-Saharan Africa. First, if having multiple wives leads men to want many children, then for fertility to decline, men's desire to take multiple wives (polygyny) would have to decline first. Second, if men's desire for more children leads to their taking additional wives, then for fertility to decline, men's desire for children would have to decline first (and subsequently polygyny would decline). Third, if an underlying desire for large families leads some men to want multiple wives and many children, then for fertility to decline the factors that affect both desires may have to change.
This study attempts to disentangle the relationships between men's desire for multiple wives and their desire for many children. Three analyses are performed. First, I analyze the determinants of monogamous men's desire for additional wives (marital intentions analysis). Second, I examine the factors associated with a desire for children among monogamous men (fertility intentions analysis). Third, I examine the factors associated with monogamous men's desire for multiple wives and additional children (marital and fertility intentions analysis). The results of the third analysis are useful

to assess which of the three hypothesized relationships between desire for wives and desire for children is the most appropriate.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
DATA
I use data from the 1991 Cameroon Demographic and Health Survey (CDHS) because the husbands of a random sample of women age 15-49 were interviewed,1 and a new question on a man's intention to take another wife in the future wasincluded. Hence, it is possible to examine men's desire for wives as well as their desire for children.
The total sample of husbands in the CDHS is 814.For these analyses, only the 618menwhoare currently in amonogamous union and whoresponded to the question on future marital intentions are included. The polygynous men are excluded because we do not know their desire for children at the time they took a second or higher order wife and became polygynous.
DEPENDENT VARIABLES
For the marital intentions analysis, monogamous men are divided into two groups based on their response to the question: Do you intend to take another (other) wife (wives) in the future? The two groups of monogamous men are those men who intend to remain monogamous in the future (truly monogamous men)and those men who intend to take another wife in the fu-

ture (potentially polygynous men). The dependent variable for this analysis is scored 1 if the man is potentially polygynous (38.03 per cent) and 0otherwise (truly monogamous men, 61.97 per cent).
For the fertility intentions analysis, monogamous men are divided into two groups based on their response to a question on whether they would like any more children in the future. This variable is scored 1 if the man reports wanting additional children (85.24 per cent) and 0 for all men who report that they want no more children or that they cannolonger have children (14.76 per cent). Men who are undecided on future childbearing and men who report that their wife can no longer have children are eliminated from this analysis (N = 36).2
Finally, for the marital and fertility intentions analysis, monogamous men are divided into four groups: (1) those who intend to remain monogamous and do not want additional children (11.98 per cent); (2) those who intend to remain monogamous and want additional children (48.96 per cent); (3) those who intend to become polygynous and to not want additional children (2.78 per cent); and (4) thosewho intend to become polygynous and want additional children (36.28 per cent). Because only a small number of men want additional wives but not additional children (N = 16), this group is not included in the multivariate analyses. The analysis uses the remaining three groups of monogamous menwith differing marriage and fertility desires.

CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SAMPLE
(INDEPENDENT VARIABLES)
As a consequence of only including monogamous men, some bias is introduced into the sample relative to the sample of all husbands from Cameroon. Table 1 presents descriptive information on the sample of monogamous men. By including only the monogamous men, the sample is less rural and more educated than the sample of all husbands in the CDHS (see

Speizer, 1995, for the distribution of the entire sample). Other characteristics of the sample associated with the monogamous men bias are (1) a greater percentage of Christian men; (2) younger mean age; (3) smaller mean number of children; and (4) less likelihood that the monogamous men work in the agriculture sector. Each of these factors (except agricultural work) is associated with being polygynous (Speizer, 1994).

HYPOTHESES
The independent variables for the marital intentions analysis are shown in Table 2. Monogamous men from rural areas are hypothesized to be more likely to intend to be polygynous because (1) they need the female labor

(Dorjahn, 1988; Lee and Whitbeck, 1990); (2) they can afford more wives because wives are less expensive in rural areas (Dorjahn, 1988); and (3) they receive prestige from the community for having multiple wives (Ukaegbu, 1977). For the marital intentions analysis, dummy variables for place of

residence are created (YaoundeV Douala, other urban,3 rural). Education, number of household possessions, type of floor in the dwelling, and type of work are all associated with place of residence and are included as dummy variables in this analysis.
The effects of education and wealth on men's desire for additional wives is uncertain. For example, men who are less educated are hypothesized to be more likely to intend to become polygynous as they are less likely to have been exposed to the modernizing influences that discourage polygyny (Aryee, 1978; Ukaegbu, 1977). On the other hand, men with secondary education may also be more likely to intend to become polygynous because they can afford multiple wives (Brown, 1981). Similarly, wealth4 may have positive or negative effects on polygyny (wealthy men can afford more wives, or are more modernized and may be less likely to want multiple wives).
A recent phenomenon in some urban areas is that wealthy, educated men have multiple partners who are not necessarily considered wives (informal polygyny) (Magnani et al., 1995). This phenomenon results in urban men appearing less polygynous than they really are. Future analyses controlling for number of partners will help to determine the level and effect of this informal polygyny.
3Any town other than Yaounde' and Douala with a population greater than 5,000 is classified as "Other Urban" while "Rural" includes all smaller villages.
4Wealth is measured as number of household possessions and type of floor in the dwelling, since no specific measure of wealth is available in the CDHS.

Also included in this analysis is religion (Christian, Muslim, traditional). Men who are Muslim or of a traditional religion are hypothesized to be more likely to intend to become polygynous through positive social supports for polygyny in these religions (Brown, 1981; Clignet, 1970).5 Finally, dummy variables for duration of marriage (<5 years, 6-10, 11-15, 16-20, 21+ ) are included. Previous studies have found that it is after the first five to seven years of monogamous marriage that a man is more likely to take another wife and become polygynous (or intend to become polygynous) (Chojnacka, 1980; Donadje and Tabutin, 1991).
For the fertility intentions analysis (see Table 3), the majority of the background variables above are included as well as several additional variables. Place of residence and type of employment are included since it is hypothesized that men from rural areas and men who work in the agricultural sector would be more likely to want additional children because children are inexpensive and useful for labor (Acsadi and Johnson-Acsadi, 1990). Also included in this analysis are level of education, number of household possessions, and type of floor in the dwelling.
Education and wealth may have positive or negative effects on the desire for additional children because educated, wealthy men are more likely to be able to afford many children, but these same men may desire fewer, quality children (Boraie et al., 1988; Cochrane et al., 1988). Since both education and wealth are correlated with place of residence, I examine their
5Although this hypothesis may be valid, 47 per cent of polygynous men in the CDHS are Christian (unweighted value, Speizer, 1994).

effects in multivariate analyses, controlling for place of residence.
Also included in this analysis are religion (Christian, Muslim, traditional), age ( < 3 0 , 30-39, 40-49, 50+), and number of living children (0-2, 3-4, 5-6,7 +). Religion is included because some religions (e.g., traditional) may have stronger social supports for childbearing than other religions (Caldwell and Caldwell, 1987). This analysis controls for age and number of living children (life cycle factors) because men later in their life cycles are less likely to desire additional children than younger men (Boraie et al., 1988). Similar analyses were performed using the wife's age. These analyses found similar life cycle effects. Matched analyses are not presented because the sample size is reduced because not all men match with a wife, and the results do not differ greatly.
Finally, I include a categorical variable for whether or not the man reports having discussed family size desires with his spouse. Discussion of desired family size with the spouse could be seen as a cause of wanting fewer children, or it could be a consequence of changed family desires. This analysis cannot determine which case is the most appropriate. I include the discussion variable as it may affect fertility desires directly, or it may be a proxy for a more egalitarian husband and wife relationship which is associated with changing fertility desires (IsiugoAbanihe, 1994).
For the marital and fertility intentions analysis, all the independent variables in the two previous analyses are included (with the exception of duration of marriage because of the high correlation (0.88) between duration of

marriage and age). This analysis assesses whether the factors associated with one desire are more important in the determination of the joint desires, or if the combination of both sets of factors is important.
ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES
Logistic regression techniques are used for the marital intentions analysis and the fertility intentions analysis. Logistic regression is appropriate for these analyses as each dependent outcome is dichotomous with mutually exclusive categories where the sum of the probabilities over both categories is equal to one (Hanushek and Jackson, 1977; Kleinbaum, 1991). For the marital and fertility intentions analysis, multinomial logistic regression techniques are used. Multinomial logistic regression is appropriate here because the dependent outcome is trichotomous with unordered mutually exclusive categories where the sum of the probabilities over all categories is equal to one (Hanushek and Jackson, 1977).
RESULTS
In the CDHS, roughly 40 per cent of currently monogamous men intend to become polygynous sometime in the future. The results of a logistic regression examining the similarities and differences between these two groups of currently monogamous men are presented in Table 2. This analysis finds that monogamous men who are Muslim or practice a traditional religion are significantly more likely to intend to become polygynous than Christian monogamous men. On all other factors (e.g., education, residence, wealth, oc-

wives and additional children are presented in Table 5. Three comparisons are shown in Table 5. The first and last comparison use the potentially polygynous men who want additional children as the reference group (Cols. 1 and 3); the second comparison uses the truly monogamous men who do not want additional children as the reference group (Col. 2). A summary of the results of this table is presented in Figure 1.
The analyses find results consistent with the two previous sections. Among men who want children, the comparison of the truly monogamous men to the potentially polygynous men (Col. 1 of Table 5, and the right side of Figure 1), shows that the most important factor differentiating these two groups is religion. Monogamous men who are Muslim or practice a traditional religion are significantly more likely to want additional wives than Christian monogamous men. The other factor that becomes significant in this comparison is age. Those men between the ages of 30 and 49 are significantly more likely to want additional wives than men under 30, perhaps because men aged 30-49 are in their prime productive and reproductive periods and are more likely to be able to afford multi-

ple wives than men under age 30. Also, men who are between age 30 and 49 have been married for many years and may be disinterested in their current marriage and feel a need or desire for a new wife. Finally, this comparison does not find any difference for men over age 50, perhaps because older men who intended to become polygynous have already become so. Therefore, future marital desires have less relevance to these older men.
The second comparison presented in Table 5 is between the truly monogamous men who do not want children and those who do (Col. 2 of Table 5, and top part of Figure 1). This analysis findsthat, controlling for age and number of living children, men from rural areas are significantly more likely to desire additional children than men from Yaounde" and Douala. Also, among men with secondary education, discussion of desired family size with the spouse is associated with a desire for no more children. The results of this analysis are similar to those of the fertility intentions analysis.
Finally, and most interestingly, the comparison of monogamous men who want neither additional wives nor children to monogamous men who want both is presented in Column 3 of Table

ditional children among monogamous men. This analysis finds that, controlling for age and number of living children, urban residence and reported discussion of family size desires among men with secondary education are associated with lower fertility desires. Therefore, with continued urbanization, education, and programs to promote spousal communication, men's fertility desires should decline. With these changes, if family planning is acceptable, available, and affordable, then we could expect a subsequent fertility decline.
The results of the third analysis show that the differences between currently monogamous men who want neither additional wives nor additional children and currently monogamous men who want both additional wives and children are primarily related to factors associated with a desire for children. This result suggests that it is men's desire for children that determines their desire for multiple wives, and not the reverse. This is the second hypothesized relationship between men's two family desires, i.e., men want children for reasons of status, financial security, labor, etc., and thus they take multiple wives to attain reproductive goals.
If religion had been found to also differentiate monogamous men who want additional wives and children from monogamous men who want neither wives nor children, then I would have concluded that men's nuptial and fertility desires are jointly determined because religion is the determining factor in the marriage analysis. Conceivably, religion is not a significant difference between these two groups because only a small number of

men want neither additional wives nor children. If the sample were larger, perhaps the effect of Muslim religion would become significant. On the other hand, the effect of traditional religion compared to Christianity was small and insignificant in this analysis (compared to large and significant in the marriage analysis). Therefore, the effect of religion appears less important than the effect of the factors associated with a desire for additional children. This finding is the basis of the conclusion that monogamous men's desire for children drives their desire for wives and high fertility.
Another factor that supports this conclusion is that the group of monogamous men who want wives and no children is small (N = 16). It is rare for a monogamous man to desire wives but not children, suggesting that the desire for wives is associated with the desire for children. On the other hand, a large number of monogamous men desire children but do not desire additional wives. Thus, while the desire for more children is independent of the desire for additional wives, the reverse is not the case, with rare exceptions.
The results of the analysis of monogamous men's desire for wives and children are useful to assess the fate of high fertility in areas where polygyny is common. Although men's marriage intentions are unlikely to change greatly in the near future (as religious affiliations are unlikely to change), there is hope for a fertility decline. With increased urbanization, education, and programs to promote spousal communication, men's desire for children is expected to decline. As men begin to desire fewer children (and begin to communicate these changing desires),

women may become more likely to adopt family planning when they no longer want children because of less fear of their husband's taking additional wives for reproductive purposes.
To date, little is known about whether men's fertility desires have been declining. It is possible that men's fertility desires have declined, but as communication between spouses in sub-Saharan Africa is rare (Caldwell and Caldwell, 1990) these changed family desires may remain unknown by wives. Therefore, wives may reproduce based on normative views of high male fertility desires (and fears of polygyny), and not based on actual information on men's changed fertility desires.
The conclusion that men's desire for children leads to their desire for additional wives and thus high fertility, is based on cross-sectional differences that reflect a current relationship between men's two family desires. This conclusion relies on the assumption that "cross-sectional differences in behavior mirror individual experiences over time" (Pebley and Jones, 1981,p. 18). Also, this conclusion relies on the assumption that men's reported intentions reflect realistic fertility and marital options. Future fertility surveys of men are needed (ideally including longitudinal panel studies) (1) to determine if men's fertility desires are declining; (2) to assess whether men who report intentions to become polygy-

nous actually attain this goal (and the reasons for attaining or not attaining this goal); and (3) to evaluate whether men who report a desire for additional children actually have more children as intended (and the reasons for having or not having children). These research areas would help to assess the usefulness of information on men's fertility and marital intentions and to confirm or update the results of this paper which are based on the limited crosssectional male data presently available. Also, it would be interesting to replicate these analyses using other Demographic and Health Survey data to determine if men's desire for children is the underlying determinant of polygyny in other areas of sub-Saharan Africa where polygyny is common.
