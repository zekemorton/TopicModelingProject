ABSRACT: Vital statistics data indicate that the age difference between spouses in first marriages has narrowed for those born between 1931 and 1951 and married by age 25. It appears that the largest declines have occurred at the older ages of marriage, although there have been reductions at all ages. The possibility that the narrowing of the age gap can be attributed to the recent "marriage squeeze" is examined using data from the 1976 National Survey of Family Growth. Insofar as it is adequately measured, the squeeze is found to be insignificant. It seems that age at marriage of the wife is inversely related to a couple's age difference. That this might simply be due to the age distribution of available men is considered and rejected. It is speculated that the relation between age difference and age at marriage is a consequence of changing preferences, not of the supposed shortage of suitable single men.

That most men marry women younger than themselves is recognized, but frequently ignored by many who study nuptiality patterns in the United States. Perhaps because this age norm of mate selection is believed to be so strong, few demographers have made it a focus of their attention. Undoubtedly the absence of the appropriate marriage data is an impediment to the study of this subject. Thus, many who have written on the topic have resorted to aggregate census data on changes in differences between the median ages at marriage of each sex over time, or a distribution of differences at one point in time (Carter and Glick, 1976; Presser, 1975).
This paper describes the trends in age differences for those born between the early 1930's and early 1950's and examines factors which might account both for the apparent changes that have occurred during the period when these birth cohorts were at risk of marriage

and for the differentials that exist at any one point in time. Note that factors affecting age at marriage of each spouse independently are not considered here. That changes in the age difference do not always parallel changes in age at marriage suggests that it is reasonable to examine factors affecting the age difference explicitly rather than factors affecting age at marriage (Presser, 1975).
To avoid any confounding effects, the analysis is limited to those women who have been married once to husbands who have been married once. The fact that the size of the age difference varies with the marital history of the partners in part reflects the willingness of older people--and the previously married tend to be older than the single--to choose a spouse from a wider range of ages (Carter and Glick, 1976; Presser, 1975). Also, the lower age boundary of the previously married is relatively high while the effective upper

age boundary for the never-married is relatively low. Given that there aren't two clearly defined marriage markets, one for those who have never been married and one for those who have, the restriction of the analysis to those couples in primary marriages may be considered somewhat artificial.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The 1976 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), a national probability sample of 8,611 ever-married or single women with offspring of whom 6,066 were married once to husbands married once, was the major data source. Other sources include the Vital Statistics from 1955, and 1963 through 1975, the 1970 census, and the 1970 National Fertility Study (NFS).
Problems emerge with much of these data. First, there is the complication that marriage data from the National Center for Health Statistics are incomplete and probably not representative of the United States as a whole (Carter and Glick, 1976; U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, 1975). Prior to 1957, estimates and characteristics of marriages were only compiled by those states which had marriage reporting systems. Consequently, the figures for first marriage characteristics in 1955, described later, cover only 23 states and in 1975 cover 41 states.
The second problem is common to analyses of survey data where temporal change is the primary focus. Women from the younger birth cohorts could only be included in the survey if they were married early. For example, a woman born in 1955who married at age 22 would be excluded from the sample because she was married after 1976. Thus, given the age limitations of the

sample, the 1955birth cohort wasnecessarily restricted to those who married at age 21 or earlier, invalidating comparisons across cohorts. This censoring problem was dealt with by establishing an upper limit of 25 on the woman's age at marriage and then excluding those birth cohorts for whom the limit was unattainable, i.e., those born after 1951. The sample size was then reduced from 6,066 to 4,398. Only when comparisons across birth cohorts were made, was the sample restricted. Limitation of the sample to women married at age 25 or earlier is not without cost. Because age at marriage has been rising, the women who married at or before age 25 in the 1970's are less likely to be representative of the entire population of married women than are those who married at the same ages in the 1960's.

RESULTS
CHANGE IN AGE DIFFERENCE
The decline in age differences between spouses for couples where the bride was no older than 25, can be seen in both Table 1 and Figure 1which summarize the NSFG data. (Short term fluctuations observed in Figure 1 are consistent with random sampling errors.)

Not only has the mean age difference decreased by approximately one year during this period, the variance has also fallen. Moreover, the decline has occurred at all ages of marriage, although the largest changes are at the older ages. According to some demographers, the decline in first marriage age differences does not appear to be a recent phenomenon, but rather a continuation of a trend that can be dated from at least the turn of the century (Presser, 1975; Carter and Glick, 1976). Those who argue that the age gap has been declining for quite some time have cited the narrowing in the difference between male and female median ages at first marriage to support their contention. Although the decline in the differences between the medians is strongly suggestive of a decline in the median or mean age difference, it is not conclusive. The difference between the medians only equals

the median difference when a distribution is symmetrical, in which case the median equals the mean. Yet, it is the median and/or the mean difference that is of interest. Furthermore, the census bureau in an attempt to furnish a cohort measure of the median age of marriage rather than one which is age distribution dependent can only provide an estimate. It is this figure, calculated by estimating the proportion of young people who are expected to get married, taking half of this expected proportion and then computing the age at marriage of those who are at this halfway point, which is offered as evidence for the above arguments. An additional complication with the census figures on median age at first marriage is that first marriages for the females may not be first marriages for their spouses, and vice versa (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1980).

A regression model was specified with age difference as the dependent variable and squeeze as the independent variable. The following equation was then estimated using the NSFG data:
AD=6.19-4A1SQ, (f=7.72)
where AD is age difference and SQ is squeeze. The squeeze coefficient in this model is significant at better than the 0.001 level. Moreover, both the sign and the size of the coefficient are reasonable, given the range of squeeze from 0.90 to 1.22 and the range of age difference from 1.7 to 3.5. However, because the squeeze was increasing during most of the period under consideration (only in the last three years does it take what appears to be a true downward course) and age differences were narrowing, it was thought to include a time trend variable. Could the observed relation between squeeze and age difference be due to a common dependence on time rather than a causative association?
When time was included in the model . the following regression equation was
estimated:
= 12633-O.95SQ-Q.Q6TIME, (/ = 1.30)(f=6.26)
where TIME is the year of marriage. Once the time trend is extracted, squeeze becomes insignificant.1
1Note that throughout this paper regressions are reported without R2. Values for R2 are below 0.05. This is to be expected. An attempt is not really being made to explain the behavior of individual women; rather, reasons for the changes in aggregate data are sought. When cohort mean age difference is regressed against squeeze and time, the R2 is over 0.7. However, the coefficients are virtually unchanged. Individual data are used to ensure the correct weighting in regressions.

It is conceivable that the marriage squeeze was insignificant simply because of the way in which it was measured. The results obtained could be an artifact of the measure used. The 1955 distribution of age differences used to calculate the squeeze can be said to reflect the preferences of those women married in 1955, but not those married since then. Ideally if social norms or preferences are changing with regard to age differences, the parameters in the squeeze measure should change also. Here they don't. One has begun with the hypothesis that norms are constant and found this assumption to be inconsistent with the data: reductio ad absurdum.
However, even when the parameters for the squeeze measure were altered either using spouse age differences for those in the sample married between 1974 and 1976, or using the distribution from the entire sample, the coefficient for the squeeze variable hardly changed (results not shown). Regardless of the direction and the magnitude of modification, if the parameters are kept within reason it is difficult to see how the squeeze coefficient could become very significant, or for that matter, significant at all. Incidentally, Presser, who relied on secondary data sources and did not attempt to measure the effect of squeeze, concluded that "the declining trend in the difference in age at marriage did not accelerate in the 1960's when the 'marriage squeeze' developed" (Presser, 1975, p. 191).
THE CHANGING STATUS
OF WOMEN
If the decline in age differences between spouses is not directly attributable to the marriage squeeze, then perhaps it is due to a more strictly social

234

rather than purely demographic phenomenon. The changing role of women in society has been thought to have altered the norms about age differences between spouses (Pfesser, 1975). Those who hold more traditional attitudes towards women's roles are said to be more likely to marry older men than their less conventional counterparts, Women may Ifiarry older men because of a desire for financial and emotional support that could be more readily acquired from a husband who had time to both mature and to gain economic security. The changing role of women in society may have undermined these norms.
An increase iri women's educational attainment is one indication of the transformation of sex roles. If at any one time the size of the age gap between a husband and a wife is a function of the amount of education the wife has had, then.it is conceivable that the increase in women's education has led to the decline in age differences. Elder and Rockwell (1976) found that welleducated women in the 1925-29 birth cohort Who married late were more likely to marry younger men than were less educated women. The desire for these women to achieve educational "homogamy" apparently overrides the social pressure to marry an older man. Is it late marriage which causes a woman to marry a younger man or the amount of education she has had? That is, is education significantly related to age differences after age at marriage is controlled for? When age difference was regressed on education, the following equation was estimated:
AD = 4.42 -0.16EDUC, (f = 10.73)
where EDUCis years of education. The

estimated coefficient has the expected sign and is significant at better than the 0.001 level. However, adding age at marriage reduces the magnitude of the education coefficient. With age at marriage included, the following regression equation was estimated:
AD = 7.16 - 0.07EDUC- 0.2QMAR, (7=4.09) (f= 13.16)
where MAR is age at marriage. Clearly, controlling for age at marriage minimizes the importance of education as an explanatory variable. The main reason it appears that highly educated women marry men closer in age to themselves than their less educated sisters is because women who stay in school marry later. Cross-tabulations indicate that those women who have not attended college but have delayed marriage to their middle or late twenties are barely distinguishable from those who have acquired more education (results not shown). Correspondingly, the age gap between spouses is large for couples where the woman married early regardless of how much education she has had. ·
WOMEN'S ATTITUDES AND AGE
DIFFERENCES
In an attempt to identify a direct relation between women's attitudes and age differences, data from the 1970 National Fertility Study, a national probability sample of ever-married reproductiveage women, were examined. The study included questions on women's rights and roles in addition to those on childbearing and marriage. The discussion here is restricted to the 1,276 women married between 1965 and 1970, in order to get at the attitudes which prevailed as close to the time of marriage as was possible.

Vol. 33,No. 3-4

Each of the 17 questions on women's rights and roles was analyzed separately to see whether the age differences of those women who gave more, and those who gave less, traditional responses varied in any consistent fashion. Three questions which addressed the issue of sexual equality, one which addressed male/female roles and another male/ female behavior, provided some support for the hypothesis that the more traditional the woman, the larger the age difference (results not shown). For example, respondents who strongly supported the notion that women should receive equal consideration for all jobs had a mean age difference of 2.1, while those who disagreed strongly had a mean age difference of 2.5. The mean age difference was 1.8 for those who strongly agreed that young girls should be allowed as much independence as young boys and 2.3 for those who strongly disagreed. However, for most of the questions concerning family and career conflicts and others directed to the feminist movement and familial happiness, the relation was either very weak, nonexistent, or reversed. Once age at marriage is included, whatever relation there was disappears. Only because a greater proportion of those having nontraditional attitudes marry late, does there appear to be an association with age differences.
It may be that the questions asked do not elicit the appropriate attitudes. Furthermore, women's responses to these questions may not correspond to their marital behavior. Some may have embraced the slogans of the women's movements without altering their actions. In addition, while an attempt was made to get at the attitudes at the time of marriage, this may not have been achieved. Even six months of mar-

riage may transform a woman's attitudes.
AGE AT MARRIAGE
From the above discussion it is evident that those marrying late are more likely to marry men closer in age to themselves than those marrying early. When age difference was regressed only on age at marriage the following equation was estimated:
AD = 6.85 -0.22MAR. (f = 16.54).
It appears that the rising age at marriage is responsible for some of the narrowing in age differences. But because age differences have declined at each age of marriage, this is only a partial explanation. As can be seen in Figure 2, which summarizes vital statistics data, the relation between these variables has been transformed between 1963 and 1975. For the 1963 marriage cohort there is a weak association between the two variables. Women who marry after age 20 are not really distinguishable from each other. By 1969 the relation between age at marriage and age differences has become somewhat stronger. In 1975 the age difference is very dependent on age at marriage. The NSFG data display a similar transformation but because of the necessary age restrictions, and the smaller sample, the graph is not as illuminating. The NSFG data do show that the Pearson Correlation Coefficient between age at marriage and age difference for women married between 1960 and 1965 was -0.09, while for those married between 1970 and 1976 it was -0.22.
Why has there been a change in the mate selection behavior among women who marry at age 21 or later? Women

marrying in and after the late sixties have been exposed to the feminist movement. Depending on how much weight is given to the results from the above attitudinal questions, it can be argued that many women were affected-- either directly or indirectly--by the movement's claims. These women may have thought it desirable to acquire their own security and status independent of a man's. As a consequence, a larger number began to postpone marriage. For these women the decision of when to get married occurred prior to meeting their chosen mate. But once they decided to marry, many were willing to wed men very close in age or even younger than themselves. They may not have needed to marry considerably older men, because they may not have needed the

protection and support that an older man can ostensibly provide. In contrast, women who delayed marriage twenty years ago probably had attitudes toward men and marriage that more closely corresponded to those who married early than to those who presently delay marriage.
Another explanation can be proposed for the transformation in the relation between age at marriage and age differences. Given that men rarely marry before age 18, the possibility for change in age differences at the younger ages is limited. Perhaps, then, an agespecific explanation for the decline should not be sought. Earlier it was claimed that the decline in age differences cannot be ascribed to the marriage squeeze. Evidence for this is that the de-

cline continued while the squeeze on women diminished. However, the explanation may be more complicated. It is possible that the squeeze did precipitate a narrowing in age differences. This may have had the effect of undermining the norms, and once weakened, there was no reversion to larger age differences despite the appropriate men being in much greater supply.
AGE AT MARRIAGE ANDTHE
AVAILABILITY OF MEN

difference between them. Therefore, the likelihood that a woman marries at a certain age difference is proportional to the number of single men at that age difference, weighted by a factor expressing the woman's preferences. This assumes that all women meet the same age distribution of single men, that there is one marriage market. For a given age at marriage a theoretical mean age difference was calculated:

It has been argued that the interval between couples narrows as the age of the bride increases, because the pool of available older men becomes increasingly limited with the postponement of marriage (Elder and Rockwell, 1976). Is an older bride more likely to marry a younger man because of this alleged demographic constraint, or is it that her preferences have altered as she has aged? These two possibilities are neither mutually exclusive nor independent. A woman may respond to a shortage of eligible older mates by modifying her choices with respect to age differences. This problem was not addressed here. However, the more restricted question of whether a woman's choices have changed irrespective of the cause was examined.
An attempt was made to investigate whether the inverse relation between age differences and age at marriage was simply due to the dwindling supply of older men. If this were the case it could be concluded that a woman's preferences are independent of age at marriage, that is, they do not change as age at marriage increases. A simplistic model was developed based on the null hypothesis that the probability of a woman marrying a particular single man that she knows depends only on the age

TAD{a) = 11 (( S=-

a +8))

where TAD(a) is theoretical mean age difference, a is age at marriage, 8 is age difference, M(a + 8) is the number of single men at age a + 8, and W(S) is the probability that a woman marries a man at age difference 8, given that the same number of single men are available to her at all ages. Unfortunately the correct values of w(8) are unknown, and the distribution of age differences for the NSFG sample was used as a crude approximation.
The calculation was then performed using data from 1970. These data were selected for two reasons. First, data were needed on the number of single men by age, and this was available from the 1970 census; and second, by 1970 a strong relation between age differences and age at marriage had emerged. A regression model was specified with age differences as the dependent variable and theoretical mean age difference and age at marriage as the independent variables. If the null hypothesis that choice is independent of age at marriage reflected reality and the true W(8)'s were known, then the coefficient for the

older men begins to be sampled will be lower. Consequently, both the minimum theoretical age difference and the upturn will be at a younger age at marriage. This will further weaken the argument regarding the supply of single men.
There are two major criticisms of this model. In the real world there are many marriage markets differentiated by such things as education, race, and residence. Here, markets have been differentiated only by age. There is the additional problem of whether all single men are in the marriage market. While here they have all been considered eligible for marriage, this may not be true. If these ineligible men were removed, this might dramatically reduce the theoretical age

differences at the older ages of marriage, thereby making the availability of single men a plausible explanation for the decline in age differences with age at marriage.
CONCLUSIONS
Age differences have declined for those born between 1931 and 1951 and married by age 25 independently of the marriage squeeze; yet neither the increase in education of women, nor their change in attitudes as measured in the NFS, appear to have induced the decline.
Age at marriage is the variable with the greatest explanatory power. Age differences narrow as age at marriage rises. While age differences have fallen

240

at all ages, the largest declines have occurred at the older ages at marriage. The relation between age differences and age at marriage, while weak at the older ages at marriage prior to 1970, is now quite strong. Preliminary analysis suggests that the relation between these two variables is a consequence of changing preferences, not ofthe supposed shortage of suitable single men. That women's choices change with age at marriage is intuitively reasonable. A 24-year-old

man is more acceptable toa26-year-old woman than is a 17-year-old man to a 19-year-old woman.
