Tables of world population frequencies purporting toestablish this trend were compiled by Post (1962), and the theory has apparently been supported by a number of subsequent population studies (Dutta, 1966; Flatz, 1967; Kang et al., 1967).
Even though this is an attractive and plausible theory, there are several reasons for questioning its generalizations:

4.4% in Brahmins and4.7% in other caste Hindus (Dutta, 1966), and5.1% in various Middle Eastern Jews (Kalmus et al., 1961 ; Adam et al., 1967). At the other end, the moderate frequencies recorded in these ancient civilized societies are not always different from those found in some of the most primitive populations on earth. There are also reasons to doubt the accuracy and the

relevance of data obtained among some primitive peoples.
2. It is indeed conceivable that color blindness could be disadvantageous for the gatherer of colored fruits. However, gathering appears to have been mainly the task of women and children. Selection against the color-blind gatherer is thus presumed to have been of a much lesser genetic importance than selection against the color-blind adult male hunter.
It is not at all certain, however, that color blindness would always be a drawback for the hunter. Moreover, there are some lines of evidence which would point to a possible advantage of color blindness for primitive man. Flicker photometry has proved that the color-blind individual is more sensitive than the normal individual to differences of brightness, when two colors are compared. De Vries (1948) noted that "very accurate adjustments [of brightnessmatch] can only be obtained by observers with a bad colour vision (e.g. dichromats)." This has also been confirmed by later studies (Adam, 1969; Crone, 1968). The color-blind hunter may therefore be quicker than others to spot slight changes in illumination caused by a moving animal, and he may be less frequently deceived by camouflage patterns on animals (Kalmus, 1965; Thoday, 1965; Roberts, 1967). It is thus possible that under certain conditions the color-blind male may even be a more successful hunter than one with normal vision. The involvement of color-blind gunners in shooting accidents cited by Neel and Post (1963), may only serve to stress this point.
Furthermore, because of this superior sensitivity, the color-blind individual might have a better chance to survive in some primitive environments, since he would also be quicker than the normal to avoid--or to kill--such camouflaged deadly enemies as humans and snakes. It is perhaps not a mere coincidence that the highest frequencies of color blindness recorded among in-

digenous Papuan-New-Guinean populations --6.0%, 6.4%, and 9.3% (Adam, Wood, Symons, Ord, and Smith, unpublished data) --were encountered in the limited, relatively dry area of about five thousand square miles of lightly wooded, grass-covered country of the South Papuan Coast. This is the only part of the territories of Papua and New Guinea in which three very venomous species of diurnal snakes abound and where snake bites form a common medical problem (Campbell, 1964; Campbell and Arthur, 1964).
3. "Red-green color blindness" is a collective term for at least six different X-linked defects, governed by two genetic loci and comprising mild anomalous trichromacies together with the much severer dichromacies. It is hardly conceivable that selection, in whichever way it might have been operating on "color blindness," would equally affect all types of color blindness. Anyone who has witnessed the dramatic difference between the anomaloscopic performance of a dichromat (and particularly of a protanope) and that of an anomalous trichromat (and particularly of a nearly normal deuteranomal) would probably not be surprised at the idea that selection could even operate simultaneously in opposite directions on various types of "color blindness." This may be true for any given environment, to say nothing of the extreme differences between the possible role of colors and of color vision in the environments of primitive man, ranging from the all-white landscape of the Eskimo to the dazzling multicolored surroundings of the tropical forest dweller.
It has been argued (Adam et al., 1967; Crone, 1968) that if selection was eliminating the severer types of color blindness in primitive societies, then relaxation of this selection pressure should have resulted in increased proportions of the severe types among the "civilized" populations. However, this has never been shown to be the case, as no relevant data are available for

the great majority of human populations since most surveys were conducted by using merely pseudo-isochromatic plates like Ishihara and H-R-R. It has been repeatedly stressed by all authorities on color vision that accurate diagnoses of the defects can only be established through anomaloscopy (Waardenburg et al., 1963). Pickford, the distinguished researcher of color blindness and an early proponent of the idea of relaxed selection, was well aware of the scarcity of population data in this respect. He wrote (1963), "Unfortunately the anomaloscope has been used very little except among white populations.... Where the Ishihara test was used, and this was the most popular test, differences of supposed degree and type of defect could not be relied upon to reveal the proportion of anomalous trichromats to dichromats with any confidence. Pseudo-isochromatic plates are very unsatisfactory from this point of v i e w . . . . A study of the relative frequencies of types and degrees of defect in a variety of different groups would be interesting."
Recently, a few non-European populations have been surveyed by a combination of a rapid screening with the plates and subsequent examination of all those who failed or even hesitated on the plates, with a portable anomaloscope, notably the Pickford-Nicolson anomaloscope which may also be operated on car batteries (Pickford and Lakowski, 1960; Adam, 1968). Incidentally, these surveys indicated that some of the previously reported low rates of "redgreen blindness" were underestimates because of incorrect interpretation of the examinees' performances on pseudo-isochromatic plates. On the one hand, there are perfectly normal people who make a few mistakes which are characteristic for colorblind individuals (Crone, 1961, 1968; Adam et al., 1967). On the other hand, it has been noted (Crone, 1961, 1968; Green, 1962; Cruz-Coke and Barrera, 1969; Adam et al., 1969) that there are color-blind individuals,

and particularly anomalous trichomats, who are able to see almost all the normal figures on the plates. This happens especially if some plates have been omitted from the test, which is a usual and permissible practice in screening surveys, and if the examinees are allowed or encouraged to concentrate for several additional seconds on each plate, which is contrary to the instructions given by the authors of the tests. Obviously, this would be the case even more frequently in testing illiterates, since they take much more time to trace the lines. Furthermore, tracing the normal lines would be easier for them if some marks have been left on the plates by the fingers of previously examined normals. Some of these mildly color-blind individuals were apparently considered to be slightly erring or careless normals and were therefore passed as normals in some surveys. The low frequencies of color blindness reported previously for a few populations were indeed found later, through anomaloscopy, to approximate the frequencies of dichromacies only (Adam et al., 1969).
I do not mean to indicate that all previous data are invalid or that all surveys which are based on plates only are bound to underestimate the rates of color blindness. A proper handling of these tests does indeed lead to a reasonable approximation of the true rate, even in a population of illiterates, provided that the survey is done by an experienced observer, who is aware of the pitfalls mentioned above and who strictly follows the instructions accompanying the tests, particularly regarding rapidity, choice of plates, and illumination.
But even if one accepts all previous population data as correct, they are still of little value for the present discussion. They give only overall rates of "red-green deficiencies" or, at most, a rough approximation of the "protan-deutan ratio." Indeed, only a few reports of this kind include a tentative, necessarily unreliable classifica-

tion, of the defects according to severity. Such a classification, however, seems to be the one most relevant for any attempt to evaluate the possible effects, both of selection and of relaxed selection, on the frequencies of "color blindness."

The populations are arranged in the table according to increasing rates of dichromacies. It may prove a more difficult task to arrange them according to the length of their civilized history. There can be little doubt, however, that some populations which are just starting to emerge from
