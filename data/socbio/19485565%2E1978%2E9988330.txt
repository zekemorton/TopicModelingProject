ABSTRACT: Using three recent samples of American married couples of childbearing age, we examined the relative contribution of male and female age to the decline in the frequency of marital intercourse with age. Contrary to the widely held belief that only male age contributes to the decline, we found a substantial contribution of female age. In the 1965 sample, the contribution of each sex was about the same. In the 1974 sample, the contribution of female age was much more important than the contribution of male age. Two alternative explanations are offered.

This paper examines the relative con- generally associated the gradual sexual de-

published (Kinsey et al., 19S3), the data showed the same decline in marital coitus by age that was noted in the male data (see Figure 1). The writers were careful to point out that although this could easily be taken for an indication of declining sexual capacity in females, the true explanation for the decline in marital coitus with age was the declining physiological capacity of their male partners. They pointed out that when the sexual behavior of single females was examined, the decline by age did not occur. Figure 2 gives the median frequency of orgasm from all sources by age for all males, all females, and single females, and the median frequency of orgasm from masturbation by age for single females who masturbated.
While other indexes of single female sexual behavior might have been chosen for comparison, the two indexes shown on Figure 2 do not offer unequivocal support for the conclusion that there is no decline in single female sexual behavior by age.

Nevertheless, it has become the prevailing view that the declines in the frequency of marital sex with age are caused by a decline in male sexual desire and performance attributable to the physiology of aging. Subsequent writers have adopted the Kinsey view that female sexual desire and performance are unaffected by aging and that therefore female age does not contribute to the decline in the frequency of marital intercourse. These conclusions have led to the acceptance of Kinsey's sad scenario as the fate of marital sexuality.
One of the tragedies which appears in a number of the marriages originates in the fact that the male may be most desirous of sexual contact in his early years, while the responses of the female are still undeveloped and while she is still struggling to free herself from the acquired inhibitions which prevent her from participating freely in the marital activity. But over the years most females become less inhibited and develop an interest in sexual relations which they may then maintain until they are in their fifties or even sixties. But by then the responses of the average male may have

dropped so considerably that his interest in coitus, andespecially in coitus with a wife who has previously objected to the frequencies of his requests, may have sharply declined. Many of the husbands in thesample reported that early in their marriages they had wanted coitus more often than their wives had wanted it. Many of the younger married females reported that they would be satisfied with lower coital rates than their husbands wanted. On the other hand, in thelater years of marriage, many of the females had expressed the wish that they could have coitus more frequently than their husbands were then desiring it. Most of the decline in themale's interestmay have represented physiologic aging; part of it may have been the product of afailure towork out effective relations in the earlier years of marriage; and part of it may have been a product of the fact that a number of the males--especially the better-educated males--were engaging in extra-marital coitus or other extra-marital sexual activities in their

forties andfiftiesat the expense of coitus with their wives (Kinsey etal., 1953, pp.353-354).
We are able to locate only one published analysis of the effect of one sex on frequency of intercourse, controlling for the age of the other. James (1974) analyzed the 1965 National Fertility Study data for couples in which both spouses were under 45 years of age. Using controls for age of the other sex, parity, and social class, he reported a negligible effect of female age and a substantial effect for male age.
Studies discussed to this point are based on behavior reports only. Two recent reports appear in the literature relating sexual motivation to age. Each shows more decline in sexual motivation with age on the part of

These attitude studies, whencombined with the behavioral and hormonal data reviewed above, suggest that thecustomary interpretations of the decline in marital sexual frequency with age must be taken with caution.

The main findings are displayed in Table 1. Inthe 1965 NFS data, husband's age and wife's age contribute about equally tothe explanation of frequency of intercourse. In the 1970NFS data, the wife's age is clearlya much greater contributor than husband's age to explaining frequency of intercourse. In the 1974 data, the importance of wife's age compared to husband's age has increased over the 1970 data.
