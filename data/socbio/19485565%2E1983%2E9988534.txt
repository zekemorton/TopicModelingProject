ABSTRACT: The relationship between the age of mother and pregnancy outcome is examined using the matched birth-infant death data for Arkansas. Indicators of pregnancy outcome are examined in relation to measures of SES and access to health care. The hypothesis that the elevated rate of newborn mortality and morbidity among infants delivered by adolescents as a consequence of biologic immaturity is examined. The analysis suggests that the higher levels of obstetric risk observed among teenage mothers is an artifact of lower SES and inferior access to health care and not biological immaturity as previously assumed.

During the past decade a vast body of research has been conducted that deals with some aspect of pregnancy and childbearing among teenagers. In nearly every instance these studies conclude that teenage pregnancy results in problems for the teenage mother, her child, and the larger society. Demographically, teenage fertility is associated with higher rates of population growth, even if completed fertility remains constant. Coale and Tye (1961), Keyfitz (1968), and Coale (1973) demonstrate the mathematical relationship between the mean age at fertility and intrinsic rates of growth.
Aside from higher intrinsic rates of growth, early entry into childbearing typically produces shorter birth intervals and higher terminal parities (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1978). Presser (1971) argues that women experiencing pregnancy as a teenager are more likely to become fatalistic about their ability to limit family size and therefore are less effective contraceptors.
Another facet of motherhood at a young age is the impact that early preg-

nancy has upon status attainment. A series of studies (Pohlman, 1968; Freedman and Combs, 1970; Hofferth and Moore, 1979) have illustrated that early pregnancy has a sustained negative impact on the accumulation of income throughout marriage. Baldwin and Cain (1980) argue that adolescent pregnancy is related to higher levels of marital discord. Cohen et. al. (1980) presented some tentative evidence that mental development is positively related to the age of the mother.
The health consequences of adolescent pregnancy include higher rates of malnutrition and prematureity (Siegal and Morris, 1970). Early studies of the relationship between maternal age and infant and maternal mortality concluded that the higher rates observed at each end of the age distribution were the result of biologic factors. Recently, however, a number of researchers have suggested that teenage pregnancy may be associated with lower not higherlevels of maternal and obstetric problems than is true of older women (Rothenberg and Varga 1981; NCDC, 1980;

NCHS, 1980). Baldwin and Cain (1980) and Morris (1981) have pointed out that the observed rates of newborn mortality among teenage mothers is probably an artifact of the higher levels of poverty and inadequate health care common to teenage pregnancy. Once the social and economic factors have been controlled, higher rates of mortality among neonates of teenage mothers disappear. It is felt that the observed levels of mortality among teenage mothers stems from their social, economic, and health care inequalities and not from innate biological immaturity.
What is the relative importance of the three sets of factors as a determinant of pregnancy outcome? Specifically, how is pregnancy outcome related to age after controls have been made for differences in social status and differential access to medical care? What are some of the implications that these relationships may have on population and public health policies? These are the major issues to be addressed in the following analysis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data upon which this study is based consist of matched Arkansas birth-infant death records for 1978.

These data include all of the information contained in the standard vital statistics forms asfiledwith the Arkansas Department of Health. As the data consist of matched birth and infant death records, it is possible to relate characteristics contained on either record. The resulting data permit a detailed analysis of information contained on the infant death record with information on birth record. In 1978 there were 36,341 births to residents of Arkansas. There were 479 deaths to the members of this birth cohort and of these, 477 were successfully matched. Of the total number of births 11,810 were nulliparious women. Due to the strong relationship between age and parity and the confounding effects that parity has on pregnancy outcome, the analysis that follows will be restricted to these 11,810 births.
RESULTS
Table 1 presents the means for several indicators of pregnancy outcome by age. It is well established that infants delivered by adolescents have a lower birth weight than is true of older mothers. Since there is a fairly strong association between birth weight and prematurity, the lower birth weight among the new-

DISCUSSION
It is clear from the preceding that the strength of association for each of the regression models is weak. The largest multiple R2 is but 0.08 birth weight and is 0.05 or less for the remaining variables. Taken as sets of predictors, the proxy variables for health access (month care started and number of visits) have the strongest association with each of the dependent variables. The indicators of social status (education, race, and marital status) have a weaker associa-

tion, and there is virtually no age effect observable once the effects of SES and health access have been controlled for. A series of stepwise regression analyses (results not presented here) show that the multiple partial for health access indicators and mortality is 0.036, while the same coefficients for social status indicators and age are 0.001 and 0.0006 respectively. Similar results are obtained using the other dependent variables.
It would appear that the observed differences in mortality and birth weight among newborns delivered by teenagers is spurious. After the effects of lower status and health care access have been removed, the apparent biological disad-

vantages attributed to teenagers disappears and, in the case of mortality and birth weight, is replaced by a slight advantage. This advantage is observed through the use of statistical controls and will not be observed in the population at large unless there are changes in the policies governing access to contraception, abortion, and health care by adolescents--especially those at the youngest ages.
