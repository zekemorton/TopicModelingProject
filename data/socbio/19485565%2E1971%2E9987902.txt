Sex Predetermination: Its Impact on Fertility*

In recent years, much has been written about techniques which allow people to control the number and spacing of babies. Within a few years, a refined technique of family planning may allow people to predetermine, prior to conception, the sex of their unborn children. People would then be able to realize their ideal family, not only with respect to spacing and number but also sex composition.
The research reported in this article was designed to achieve the following five purposes:
1. Measure the extent of public knowledge concerning biological research developments in sex predetermination.
2. Determine the extent to which people are in favor of, uncertain about, or against the idea of sex predetermination for themselves and for others.
3. Ascertain some of the major influences affecting predispositions to accept this new technique for themselves and others.
4. Determine which social variables are associated with opinions toward sex predetermination.
5. Examine the probable association of sex predetermination and fertility patterns.
TECHNIQUES OF SEX PREDETERMINATION
The idea of sex predicting, and even sex choosing, is not new. According to Gordon (1958), an Egyptian papyrus written about

4,000 years ago predicted that women with greenish cast were certain to have boys. The Hebrew Talmud went further. It forecast that placing the marriage bed in a northsouth direction favored the conception of boys.
Zirkle (1958) has outlined three ancient theories of sex determination. The ancient Hebrews believed that each testicle contained semen of one sex; the right testicle contained male semen while the left one contained female semen. A second prevailing theory was that the sex of the offspring was the same as the gender of the most "heavily sexed parent." A third theory advocated that sex was determined by the direction of wind at the time of coition. North wind begot males; south wind begot females. According to Zirkle, this last theory faded out in the seventeenth century.
Although techniques of sex predetermination have not yet been perfected, no major biological or chemical breakthroughs are necessary to implement the technology needed for sex choosing. Etzioni (1968) predicted that the predetermination of sex is five years away, while Taylor (1968) forecasted sex choosing sometime before 1975.

Kahn and Weiner (1967) stated that one of the hundred technological innovations forecast for the next 33 years is the "capacity to choose the sex of unborn children."
There are two general strategies for choosing the sex of unborn children. The first is artificial insemination following the separation of semen into X and Y sperm. The second calls for selection against one type of sperm within the reproductive tract of the female after natural intercourse.
In the past several years there have been many advances in techniques for separating organic molecules, cellular components, and cell types. Because X sperm are heavier than Y sperm, the two can be separated by centrifuging at high speeds for short periods of time. Using bull semen, Lindahl (1958) has reported excellent separation of male sperm (quantified by determining sex ratios after artificial insemination). However, the X sperm were apparently damaged by the high gravitational forces generated. Nevertheless, in the ten years since this work, centrifugation techniques have been refined considerably and this method possibly holds promise of success.
Even more promising is the separation of semen in an electrical field (electrophoresis) followed by artificial insemination. Using rabbit semen, Gordon (1958) has reported correctly predicting the sex of females in 71% of the cases, while prediction for males was 64%. Human sperm can also be separated by this technique. To date, however, no insemination has been tried with separated sperm, primarily because it has been impossible to quantify the separation prior to breeding. However, Barlow and Vosa (1970) have developed a staining procedure which differentiates between X and Y sperm. According to Nature magazine's "News and Views" (1970, p. 897) "the technique will certainly afford a useful test of success to those who are trying to separate male and female determining sperm as a means of sex control." With some refine-

ments, in vitro separation of semen followed by artificial insemination seems to be the most promising technique for actual use in the near future.
Other scientists have opted for methods which would avoid artificial insemination. About thirty years ago, there was some excitement over the use of acid and alkaline douches. Supposedly, an alkaline douche after intercourse completely selected against X sperm (Cook, 1941). However, other scientists were unable to duplicate these results.
There is one method of sex choosing which enjoys some popularity today. Since it is known that Y sperm swim faster than X sperm, Shettles (1961) has postulated a method of sex choosing based on the rhythm technique. If intercourse occurs shortly after ovulation (when the egg is high in the Fallopian tube) there will be a greater chance that fertilization will be by a Y sperm. Although the reliability of this technique is questionable, a new drug, Estrindex (Tara Industries, Inc.), is now being marketed with the specific intent of facilitating sex preselection.
I t seems probable, however, that the technology of sex choosing will be refined within a few years. Assuming that this innovation were adopted, what kind of demographic and social psychological implications would this technology have on human populations?
EARLIER FINDINGS ON SEX PREFERENCES AND THEIR IMPACT ON FERTILITY
There are two levels of analysis which yield markedly different perspectives. At the macro-analytic level, the world population explosion has already challenged the "how many" question. The "what kind" question is more complex and certainly less important at this point in history. However, many scientists, as well as laymen, in the absence of empirical data, are alarmed at the possible consequences of sex predeter-

mination. As the journal Science (1957, p. 1059) stated in an editorial:
The obvious problems that are likely to arise if successful control of human sex determination becomes practicable . . . makes one wonder whether human beings have yet acquired the wisdom to make use of such wide powers.
While such macroscopic problems are of ultimate importance, this study was designed to analyze some possible problems on the more immediate microscopic level. With the individual or family as a focal point, sex predetermination for some would have a strong positive effect. People could control a critical variable in their family planning or correct previous sex imbalances in their family. However, for many others, the availability of sex predetermination techniques could be a mixed blessing. As Michelmore (1968, p. 412) stated:
Many scientists think the day is not far off when parents will be able to choose the sexof their children. It will be interesting to see what effects this has on the population. There are already millions of people quite incapable of making a decision. How will this vast army of "don't knows" react when faced with so important a choice?
From a demographic point of view, sex predetermination could influence three important population variables: first-child patterns, sex ratio, and family size. If sex choosing becomes a reality, the relative social values of bearing male or female children would be critical. Ideal family sex ratios would become real sex ratios. As William Graham Sumner (1906, p. 312) said:
In all variations of the life conditions, in all forms of industrial organization and at all stages of the arts, conjunctures arise in which the value of children fluctuates and also the relative value of boys and girls turns in favor, now of one, now of the other.
There are data to suggest that Sumner's statement could be more specific today. May and Heer (1968) cite evidence which shows that, in India, parents would rather bear male than female children. Williamson

(unpublished) demonstrated that there is a preference for male babies in many diverse cultures around the world.
In the United States, Dinitz, Dynes, and Clarke (1964) asked unmarried college students to indicate their sex preferences for their future children. The results were striking. When confronted with the hypothetical possibility of having only one child, 9 1 % of the males and 66% of the females wanted a boy. Concerning the first child of the family, men and women chose similarly: 60% wanted a boy; 5% chose a girl; and 34% expressed no preference (a choice not available for the first question). When religion was controlled, Catholics and Jews chose boys overwhelmingly, while Protestants favored boys somewhat less.
Winston (1932) studied 55 upper-class students, recording anonymously their desire for marriage and children. In total, the students wanted 86 boys and 52 girls, a 65% greater demand for males over females. Other studies (Clare and Kiser, 1951; Freedman, Freedman, and Whelpton, 1960) showed a similar preference for male children.
There is good evidence that the preference for male children is more than ideal. Winston (1932) studied 5,466 high-income completed families and found that there were 8,329 males born alive as compared to 7,434 females, which gave a sex ratio at birth of 112.0 (compared to the national average which was 105.6). The sex ratio of the last child born to these families was 117.4; that is, significantly more families stopped having children after they had a boy than after they had a girl. Westoff et al. (1961) found that when the first child was a boy the interval before a second child was conceived averaged three months longer than when the first child was a girl. In other words, people already make crude efforts to determine the sex composition of their families.
Etzioni (1968), summarizing the demo-

graphic implications of sex predetermination, predicted that such a technology would result in a 7% increase in male children in the United States. Implicit in this forecast are two assumptions: that, in time, sex choosing would be adopted by virtually everyone and that people would choose the sex according to past indications.
Along with the desire to have more boys than girls, there is the concomitant wish to have at least one of each sex in completed families. This line of reasoning has led investigators to postulate that sex predetermination would result in smaller families (Pohlman, 1968). Clare and Kiser (1951) and Westoff, Potter, and Sagi (1963) stated that preference regarding the sex of children affects the size of a family, but is not a major determinant of family size. If couples fail to achieve the desired sex composition of their families, there is pressure to have another child with the hope of obtaining a proper sex ratio. Using a national probability sample of white females in childbearing years, Freedman (1960) stated:
Preference for at least one child of each sex has a minor but significant influence in determining whether couples with 2, 3, or 4 children expect to have an additional child. This relationship was found to persist with a number of socioeconomic and demographic controls.
To summarize, it seems evident that the technology of sex predetermination has sufficient implications in many areas of demography to merit study. As Meier (1968), discussing sex choosing, stated:
At this stage of the study, the investigator... must find means for detecting new storm centers of potential change while they are still on the distant horizon. He must interpret what impact they are likely to have upon territories in which a population problem exists.
For these reasons, the authors decided to undertake a study which would throw more light on public attitudes toward sex predetermination and on the likely choices re-

garding the sex of children in the event that control of the process were possible.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A questionnaire was constructed which included items relevant to the several concerns of the study. These items covered the demographic and social characteristics of the respondent, his views on ideal family size and desired sex composition, his opinions about heart transplants and birth control, his knowledge of developments concerning the process of sex predetermination, and his attitudes about sex predetermination and the conditions under which they might change.
Some 438 questionnaires were distributed to groups of students at Florida State University, Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University, and Tallahassee Junior College. Of the total sample, 283 (64%) were returned. In addition to the high rate of nonresponse, the sample of students was heavily biased toward social science majors and slightly biased toward females. Generalizations to the broader population are not warranted, but many of the findings are so clear-cut as to permit tentative generalizations. Moreover, there are two characteristics of this,sample which make it worthy of study. Most of these students will be married in a few years, if they are not married already. The technology of sex predetermination is estimated by many to be three to five years in the future. Thus, a considerable portion of this sample will be planning their families when sex predetermination will probably be a real option to them. Also, the educated community may act as opinionmakers and wield influence beyond their numbers in determining whether sex-choosing will be adopted by the general population.
RESULTS
As stated previously, sex predetermination, in its initial stages, will call for rather

sophisticated techniques of birth control. Ninety-seven per cent of the sample believed that married people should be allowed to use any method of birth control, 2% would restrict people to the rhythm method, and 1% were opposed to married couples using any form of birth control. For themselves, 92% favored the possible use of birth control, 3 % would only use the rhythm method, and 5% stated that they would never use birth control.
Only 33 Catholics were included in the sample. However, they were overwhelmingly in favor of birth control for others (97%) and for themselves (94%). On the other hand, there was some opposition to birth control among black students. While 92% of these favored birth control for others, 19% stated that they would not use any form of birth control.
A recent medical breakthrough which has received a substantial amount of publicity is the human-heart transplant. There was interest in knowing to what extent the respondents accepted this medical innovation, since acceptance of one medical innovation may be related to acceptance of other such innovations. In this sample, 88% approved of that technique. There was little variation in this percentage among population subgroups, indicating widespread acceptance of this medical innovation. The rejectionacceptance patterns of past medical innovations thus suggest acceptance of such an innovation as one permitting sex predeter-

mination, but the uniqueness of this particular innovation could possibly create a different set of attitudes among the public.
There is a consensus among most scientists that the adoption of sex-choosing by the general population would lead to an excess of male infants. With the exception of the study by Dinitz et al. (1964), all previous predictions were based on direct evidence. In this study, respondents were asked: "Ideally, how many children of each sex would you like to have?" The data show that this sample wanted 485 (55.4%) males and 390 (44.6%) females. This would result in a sex ratio of 122 males for every 100 females if ideal family size could be converted into actual family size.
Logically extending the analysis, it was then determined in what order, according to sex, the sample wanted their future children. Table 1 makes it quite clear that especially for their first child this population preferred male over female children.
Both men and women overwhelmingly would like their first child to be a boy. Regardless of their ideal family size, fully 80% of the men desired a first boy, while only 4% wanted a girl, and 16% listed no preference; 79% of the women wanted a male child first, 12% wanted a girl, and only 9% listed no preference. After the first child, 60% of all respondents wanted a girl for their second child. When ideal family size was held constant, of those respondents wanting only two children, 76% chose a boy for their first

child and then 74% listed a girl for their second child.
For those wanting additional children, 48% desired a boy for their third child, and 53% wanted a boy for their fourth child. As Table 1 indicates, the percentage of those respondents indicating no preference became larger with each additional child. Thus, for larger families, the pattern of beginning with a boy and then alternating sex still exists, although somewhat weakened.
It was necessary to establish whether the subject material of this investigation was salient to the respondent. The data show that about two-thirds of the women and one-half of the males in this sample have devoted frequent thought to their future family size. However, all studies of the future are fraught with one danger--that due to its remoteness people have never been exposed to the ideas concerning the research topic. When this sample was asked: "Have you ever heard of sex predetermination of children before?", 76% responded "yes." Of those who listed "yes," 60% said that their source of knowledge was the mass media, while 26% listed school sources (professor, textbooks, etc.), and 14% listed personal sources (parents, friends, etc.).
We are not convinced that three-quarters of these students have indeed heard of sex predetermination, as the data would indicate. Many of their sources were vague; 70% who listed mass media could not give the specific source of their information. Further, many listed sources which, to our knowledge, have never published material in this area.
Implicit in Etzioni's (1968) analysis of sex predetermination was the assumption that there would be little or no resistance to its adoption by the general population. Table 2 shows that 26% of the sample would like to choose the sex of their future children, while 33% are undecided or have no preference, and 40% are opposed to the idea.
We also asked our sample if they would

favor allowing others to predetermine the sex of future children. Under these circumstances, 40% would permit sex choosing by others, while 36% were undecided or had no preference, and only 18% were opposed.
Attitudes toward sex predetermination were unrelated to father's occupation and father's and mother's education. However, many independent variables did have a patterned influence on sex-choosing attitudes, as shown in Table 2.
These data show that as class rank and age increased sex-predetermination attitudes became more favorable. Black and male respondents favored sex-choosing more than white female respondents.
People who are, or have been, married ("ever married") favored sex predetermination much more than people who had never been married. Possibly, the problems of family planning were much more relevant to this group of people. The data show that married people had more frequent thought about their ideal family size (70% to 58% for nonmarried people); married people also wanted smaller families than did single people (3.05 to 3.30 children).
The relationship between sex-choosing attitudes and religious preferences is also shown in Table 2. The data show that there was almost no variation among various Protestant groups. Those who listed no religion had, as a group, the most favorable attitudes towards sex predetermination. On the other hand, Catholics were most opposed to that innovation.
There was a complex interrelationship between people's attitudes and what they perceived to be the attitudes of their churches toward a given subject. No religious institution has commented on the future possibility of sex predetermination; yet, of those people with church affiliations, 64% perceived that their church would take a specific stand on this issue. Table 3 deals with the respondent's perception of his church's attitudes toward sex choosing.

Those who listed no religion, had no perception of what their church thinks, or did not care what their church thinks of sex predetermination were more likely to be in favor of sex choosing than groups which had other religious perceptions.
I t has been postulated that sex predetermination could decrease actual family size by allowing people to achieve the sex composition of their ideal family. Table 4 shows the relationship between sex-choosing attitudes and ideal family size.
Those who favored sex predetermination would like, on the average, 0.75 less children than those who were opposed to that innovation. Table 4 shows that such families desired 0.45 less boys and 0.17 less girls. The idea implied from these data, that sexchoosing could possibly lower the birth rate, will be developed in the discussion at the end of this paper.
It has been stated previously that the

whole concept of attitude toward a future technology is rather tenuous. It should be expected that people's attitudes toward sex predetermination are quite fluid at this point in history. This study was designed to test the firmness of people's attitudes toward sex-choosing by presenting conditions which might make the alternative choice more or less attractive.
Presumably, if people have all children of one sex, they might turn to sex predetermination to assure them a balanced family. On the other hand, the medical techniques by which sex-choosing might be accomplished were never made explicit in this questionnaire. How would those already committed to sex predetermination react to accomplishing that act by use of artificial insemination with the husband's sperm or the use of a prescription pill? Table 5 examines the pattern of opinion shifts upon the addition of extenuating circumstances.

Faced with an all-boy or all-girl family (even though these two situations were posed as separate questions, the responses were almost identical), 26% of those who were against sex predetermination changed their minds, while 84% who listed "not sure" or "no preference" switched to a positive evaluation of sex-choosing.
Many of those in favor of sex predetermination did not like the idea of using artificial insemination techniques to choose the sex of their future children, however. Fully 50% defected from their favorable opinion; 17% changed to "no," while 33% moved to a "not sure" position. The use of a prescription pill would bring mixed results. Of those who favored sex-choosing, 21% changed their opinion to "not sure," while 15% changed to "no." Of those against sex predetermination, 14% would be "not sure" of the technique if it could be accomplished by taking a pill, while 13% would favor sex-choosing under those circumstances.
DISCUSSION
The adoption, even to a limited extent, of sex-predetermination techniques would have obvious implications for many areas of demography. Three consequences will be emphasized here: first-child patterns, sex ratio, and the birth rate.
The data from this study and from Dinitz et al. (1964) support the contention that most people would like their first child to be a male. The sample for both studies was college students. However, other indirect evidence (Williamson, unpublished) suggests that the first male preference is quite general, if not a universal phenomenon. In this study, people listed three broad categories of reasons for wanting a first-born male: "carry on the family name," "girls are harder to raise," "a girl should have an older brother." In a more comprehensive study, these reasons for wanting a first-born male could be further studied and analyzed.
As discussed previously, Etzioni (1968)

stated that sex choosing could cause a serious imbalance in the sex ratio. There are two implicit assumptions in his work: that everyone would adopt this innovation and that they would choose the sex of their future children according to past indications. Further, these patterns of sex predetermination would not only operate in the near future, but also would remain unchanged in the foreseeable future.
Concerning the first assumption, these data indicated that a sizeable percentage of people would initially take advantage of sex-predetermination techniques. Etzioni's second assumption is impossible to test a priori. However, in this study, respondents were quite specific about the order, according to sex, of their future family. Less than 25% of the sample checked "no preference" in choosing the sex composition they desired, and only 15% expressed no sex preference for their first two children.
But there are no data anywhere which would suggest if or how people would adjust their actual or ideal family if there were an excess of male children. These data only project into the near future and suggest that if sex-choosing were adopted there would be an excess of male children.
It is well known that there is already an excess of male babies at birth. A count of live births shows that 105 males are born for every 100 females. Thus, it might be stated that the desire for excess male children is merely a reflection of infant mortality rates and that, in fact, people want balanced families. This idea may be refuted for two reasons. There is no evidence that people plan the sex composition of their families taking into account the infant mortality rates of the sexes; rather, it is more probable that respondents were thinking of grown children, not infants, in their ideal family. Secondly, even if male mortality were an important factor in family planning, the sex ratio at birth would account for little of the proposed excess males in ideal families.
