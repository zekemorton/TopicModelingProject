ABSTRACT: Men and women in national surveys from four countries, the United States, Canada, Great Britain, and Norway, give mutually inconsistent reports of numbers of opposite-gender sexual partners. In all cases the number of female partners reported by men exceeds the number of male partners reported by women. Gender difference in reporting bias seems to be the most plausible explanation for the discrepancies.

Sexual behavior may be among the most difficult topics on which to collect reliable data. First, sexual behavior concerns intimate personal matters. Reporting on such matters, even in fully confidential and/or anonymous settings, conflicts at least in part with the inherently private nature of sexual behavior (Bradburn and Sudman, 1979; Catania et al., 1986; DeMaio, 1984). Second, sexual behavior is deeply entangled with issues of selfimage and personality. Sexual behaviors are not merely discrete physical activities, but activities that are associated with basic notions of self-esteem and are integral parts of self-definition. Third, a number of sexual behaviors are either morally condemned by large segments of society (e.g., homosexuality and infidelity) or illegal (e.g., rape, incest, and child molestation). Reports related to such behaviors open respondents to moral disapproval (by an interviewer) and/or potential social and legal repercussions (should confidentiality be breached). Fourth, much sexual behavior can not be validated, and

even what validation is theoretically possible can be achieved only through elaborate and expensive research designs (Miller et al., 1990). Finally, the above inherent difficulties of studying sexual behavior are made worse by the dearth of experience in collecting sexual behavior data. Despite the manifest importance and centrality of sexual behavior, there have been few surveys designed to collect such data and even less methodological work on developing optimal collection procedures (Smith, 1991a).
This paper examines the reliability of one key type of sexual behavior by comparing reports of the number of opposite gender sex partners reported by men and women. Within a closed population, the number of female sexual partners reported by men must equal the number of male sexual partners reported by women. Thus, agreement between men and women validates the aggregate reports and suggests that the reports are reliable. Discrepancies on the other hand indicate either a deviation from the closed

population assumption or some inaccuracy in the data for one or both genders (Gurman, 1989).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data on number of sexual partners are available from eight surveys in four countries. Basic details on these surveys are given in Table 1. Each are representative probability samples of either all adults or of adults up to approximately age 60. Three different data collection modes are employed: six used self-completion forms during a personal interview, one was over the telephone, and one was a mail questionnaire.
Each of these surveys asks a series of questions that allows the determination of number of heterosexual partners over varying reference periods (question wordings available in Smith, 19916). These questions differ in their wordings, response categories, and time frames.
We will (1) report the results from each survey, considering as we do possible adjustments, and (2) examine the general pattern across all surveys.

RESULTS
NORC-GSS, 1988-1990
In the 1988, 1989, and 1990 General Social Surveys (Davis and Smith, 1990), the number of female sexual partners during the last twelve months reported by men greatly exceeded the number of male partners reported by women. In 1988, among all male heterosexuals the mean number of partners reported was 1.84, while female heterosexuals reported only 0.98 partners. In 1989 the number of partners reported were 1.48 by men and 0.90 by women. In 1990 the number of partners reported by men was 1.85 and for women it was 0.90. Neither the means for men nor women are statistically different across years. Among heterosexuals, for each female partner that a man has, a woman has a male partner. Thus in a closed population the number of heterosexual partners for women should be equaled by the number of heterosexual partners for men. Instead of parity, we find that the ratio of female partners to male partners is 1.88:1 in 1988; 1.64:1 in 1989; and 2.06:1 in 1990.

First, we consider the possibility that these differences are the result of a few extreme values affecting the mean. Means, of course, can be disproportionately affected by a small proportion of cases with extreme values. Such cases have been shown to distort findings on frequency of sexual intercourse (Jasso, 1985; Kahn and Udry, 1986; Jasso, 1986), and there has been speculation that similar distortion might be occurring in reports of number of sexual partners (Wadsworth et al., 1990). Since the GSS figures are based on grouped ranges (0/1/2/3/4/510/11-20/21-100/101 + ), they already reduce the impact of extreme values. We further minimized their impact by converting all reports in the top two categories (21-100 partners, and more than 100 partners) to 30 partners. This reduced the mean number of female and male partners in 1988 to 1.51 and 0.94 and the ratio to 1.61:1. For 1989 the number of female and male partners decreased to 1.43 and 0.86, but the ratio marginally increased to 1.66:1. For 1990 the truncated mean for men was 1.59 and for women 0.90 (unchanged). This reduced the femaleto-male ratio from 2.06:1 to 1.77:1. Thus, truncation does not eliminate the discrepancies in reported number of sex partners. In addition, since we have no empirical basis to question the extreme cases, we can not accept the truncated values as more accurate than the raw values.
Next, we consider the possibility that differences in the magnitude or pattern of item nonresponse might explain the discrepancies. Nonresponse is always a potential cause of bias and there is some evidence that nonresponse on sexual behavior items is correlated with having a less permissive

sexual orientation in general and fewer sex partners in particular (Catania et al., 1986). For nonresponse to account for the differences observed here, nonrespondents among men would have to have fewer partners than responding men and/or nonrespondents among women would have to have more partners than responding women. Overall, there are similar levels on item nonresponse (including not doing the whole self-completion supplement) for men (1988 = 6.6 per cent; 1989 = 10.4 per cent; 1990= 15.8 per cent) and for women (1988 = 5.9 per cent; 1989 = 9.1 per cent; 1990=14.5 per cent). An analysis of this nonresponse found that "nonresponse does not appear to be related to differences in sexual behavior. Nonresponse differentials appear to be absent among those variables most closely related to sexual behavior. Nonresponse instead is related to general factors such as low political interest and general uncooperativeness that are not highly related to sexual behavior (Smith, 1989)." It therefore appears unlikely that nonresponse explains the discrepancies in number of heterosexual partners.
Finally, we consider whether differences in the gender distribution of the target population can explain the differences. Within a closed population the number of cross-group dyads must have the same mean only if the two groups are equal in size. In a population of two men and eight women, if women reported a mean of one male partner, the men would have a mean of four female partners. Of course within the target population (U.S. residents 18+ living in households), the two genders are in fairly close balance. There is, however, a surplus of women, and when we compare the

206

aggregate number of partners reported for the total populations of men and women, we find that the ratios are reduced. For example, in 1988, multiplying 1.84 female partners by an estimated 81,113,000 heterosexual men gives 149,248,000 female partners in total. For women 0.98 times 90,717,000 gives 88,903,000 male partners. The ratio between the total number of female and male partners is 1.68:1. For 1989 the adjusted ratio if 1.47:1, and for 1990 it is 1.84:1. Thus, the adjustments for the relative share of the two populations does lessen the discrepancy, but does not explain it away.
In 1989 and 1990 it was also possible to compare the number of lifetime adult partners reported by men and women. As with the annual rates reported above, among heterosexuals the number of partners reported by each gender should balance out once out-of-scope partners are accounted for. Because of greater error in recall, the greater likelihood of out-of-scope partners, and much higher item nonresponse, the adult lifetime comparisons of male and female partners are more problematic than the comparisons based on the last year counts of number of partners. These complications would not necessarily have any systematic effect on gender differences in reports on number of partners and would seem to be insufficient to account for the large differences between genders in Table 2. Both with and without adjustments for item nonresponse and extreme values, men report a much higher number of partners than women do (female-to-male ratios of 3-4:1).*
1The greater adult lifetime discrepancy between men and women suggests that the differential in last year reports was not the result of greater telescoping among men than among women.

In brief, there is no evidence that nonresponse explains the discrepancies in number of sex partners. Extreme values explain some of the difference in the annual rates (in 1988 and 1990 if not for 1989) and the adult lifetime rates, but there is no evidence that the extreme values are errant; and differences in population distribution do potentially explain some, but by no means all, of the difference.
UNITED STATES, 1970
The 1970 NORC survey conducted for the Kinsey Institute (Klassen et al., 1989; NORC, 1987; Klassen et al., 1989) found that men had between 7.26-7.44 female partners before their first marriage, while women reported 0.87-0.88 premarital male partners for a ratio of 8.34-8.45:1. Truncating extreme values to 50 reduced the number of female partners reported by men to 6.80-6.97 and lowered the ratio to 7.82-7.92:1. Item nonresponse was higher for men (11.5 per cent) than for women (4.2 per cent), but an extensive analysis of the correlates of non-

response indicated that nonresponse was not particularly related to sexual behavior and the correlates were similar for men and for women. Since the reference period was before marriage for cohorts over the entire century, no age-gender adjustments for the target population were conducted.
UNITED STATES: ALCOHOL STUDY,
1990
The 1990 National Alcohol Survey found that men reported 0.88 female partners in last 30 days. 1.46 in the last year, and 3.2 in the last five years.2 Women reported 0.73 male partners in the last 30 days, 0.88 in the last year, and 1.29 in the last five years. Femaleto-male ratios are 1.21:1 for 30 days, 1.66:1 for 1 year, and 3.20:1 for five years. Truncating to 7 partners for 30 days, 10 partners for the last year, and 50 partners for 5 years slightly reduced the female-to-male ratios. Item nonresponse did not significantly vary by gender.
CANADA
The 1988 Canadian survey (Ornstein, 1989) found that men reported 3.61 female partners over the last five years, while women reported 1.17 male partners for a female-to-male ratio of 3.09:1. We examined the impact of extreme values by truncating values above 50 to that maximum. That lowered the number of female partners reported by men to 3.32. Since no women reported more than 50 partners, their mean remained 1.17 andthe

ratio fell to 2.84:1. Since item nonresponse was nearly equal for both genders (men= 5.4 per cent, women = 5.8 per cent), no adjustment was made for this factor. Since there are slightly more women 18+ than men 18+, the unadjusted ratio for the target population falls to 2.92:1, and the truncated ratio for the target population is 2.69:1.
GREAT BRITAIN
The 1988-89 British survey (Wadsworth et al., 1990)asked about number of sexual partners over the last six months, year, two years, five years, and lifetime. The number of female partners reported for men was respectively 0.99, 1.22, 1.58, 2.59, and9.15, and the number of male partners reported by women was respectively 0.85, 0.95, 1.12, 1.49, and 2.79. The female-to-male ratios were 1.16:1 for six months, 1.29:1 for one year, 1.42:1 for two years, 1.73:1 for five years, and 3.28:1 for one's lifetime. The lifetime number of female and male partners was reported as respectively 11.0 and 2.9 for a ratio of 3.79:1 (Maddox, 1989), but it was later stated that "the mean number of 'lifetime partners'was misreported in the article; our figures show a smaller disparity between means for men and women" (Johnson et al., 1990). Our figures are calculated from data presented in Wadsworth et al., 1990.
Since these figures are calculated from reported means and grouped data, we cannot calculate truncated means, but the available information indicates that truncation would have reduced the ratio in a manner similar to that of other surveys (Wadsworth et al., 1990). Item nonresponse levels ranged from 7.0 to 14.7per cent across

208

time periods for men and from 7.5 to 10.9 per cent for women. No adjustment was made for this nonresponse. We applied adjustments based on the age-gender structure of the target population for the figures for six months to five years. (Lifetime figures were not adjusted since the age-gender structure at any single point in time is not applicable.) Since there are slightly more men than women, the ratios widened: six months = 1.18:1, one year = 1.32:1, two years = 1.44:1, and five years = 1.76:1.
NORWAY
The 1987 Norwegian survey (Sundet et al., 1988; Sundet et al., 1989) indicated that men had 12.52 female partners over their lifetime, while women had 5.21 male partners for a ratio of 2.40:1. When extreme values were truncated to 115, the number of female partners dropped to 11.29, and the ratio to 2.17:1. Item nonresponse did not vary greatly by gender (men=9.7 per cent, women = 8.1 per cent), so no adjustments were made. Since there are slightly more Norwegian men age 18-60 than women, the unadjusted ratio for the target population rose to 2.50:1, and the truncated ratio increased to 2.25:1.

ancies increase as the reference period lengthens, and there may also be crossnational differences in the magnitude of the ratio, but the discrepancies in all cases are in the same direction.
Item nonresponse levels are usually similar for men and women, although marginally higher for men. At least in the five American surveys there is little evidence that item nonresponse is linked to sexual behavior. (The 1990 National Alcohol Study suggests that nonresponse might be higher among the sexually less active, but nonresponse is not related to gender.) In all but one case (1 year rates in the U.S. in 1989), truncation reduces the discrepancies, but the decreases are small and are not necessarily more accurate than the untruncated ratios. Finally, adjusting for the gender distribution of the target population decreases the ratios when the entire adult population is covered (Canada and United States) and increases the ratios when the elderly are excluded (Great Britain and Norway). As the survey-by-survey discussion above indicated, various adjustments of the data for item nonresponse, extreme values, and the agegender structure of the various target population occasionally moderate the differences, but do not explain them.

GENERAL RESULTS
Table 3 indicates that in all surveys men report more female partners than women report male partners. (This is also true in other studies. See May et al., 1989 and Kinsey et al., 1953.) The ratio of female-to-male partners ranges from a low of 1.16:1 among the British over the last six months to 8.45:1 among Americans before their first marriage. It is clear that the discrep-

DISCUSSION
EXPLANATIONS FOR THE DISCREPANCIES
There are three basic possible explanations for the discrepancies in the number of sexual partners: (a) noncoverage, (b) nonresponse, and (c) misreports. Our analysis (reported in Smith, 19916) concludes that intentional misreports are most likely the main source of the discrepancies.

marital, and postmarital. If most sexual partners are accumulated during nonmarital years (and data on both sexual activity by marital status and age and monogamy support this assumption; see Greeley et al., 1990; Smith, 1990) and if men feel compelled to exaggerate their number of sexual partners and/or women feel constrained to underreport their number of partners, then longer term reports, which cover more nonmarital years, would be the most distorted.
If premarital reports are the main source of misreports, then we would expect the discrepancies to be greatest for premarital reports. This appears to be the case since the premarital reports for the 1970 U.S. survey show the largest discrepancy. In addition, in the GSS studies the discrepancy between the sexes on number of partners comes almost entirely from the unmarried. In each year the married respondents did not significantly differ in their reported number of sex partners (1988: men=1.29, women = 1.10; 1989:men = 1.00, women = 0.91; 1990: men = 1.06, women = 1.00). Unmarried men on the other hand reported many more partners than unmarried women (respectively 2.67 vs. 0.86 in 1988, 2.29 vs. 0.89 in 1989, and 2.97 vs. 0.81). Of course the marital status of partners is not known and could vary by gender and the proportion of adults married does differ by gender. Still the numbers indicate that the differences in reports are largely centered among the unmarried. This is also consistent with Kinsey data that show high agreement among the married on frequency of sexual intercourse, but considerable disagreement among the nonmarried (Kinsey et al., 1953).

CONCLUSION
Information on sexual behavior is important for understanding human society in general and in particular such facets as gender relations, sex roles, marriage, fertility and birth control, and social networks. In addition, the spread of AIDS and other STD's makes an accurate knowledge of sexual behavior a pressing public health concern. Yet the discrepancies in the reports of men and women on number of sexual partners raises the question whether reliable and accurate sexual behavior data can be collected. The discrepant reports of men and women on number of sex partners indicate that great care must be taken when working with sexual behavior data and probably any analysis should be conducted under the assumption that either the rates reported by men or those reported by women might be correct. More methodological work is needed to isolate and minimize measurement error so that more reliable and accurate data on sexual behavior can be collected.
