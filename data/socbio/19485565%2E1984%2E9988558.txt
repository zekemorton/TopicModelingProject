ABSTRACT: A comprehensive benefit-cost analysis of the screening program to detect newborns with PKU in Wisconsin is presented. Classic PKU is a genetic disorder which, if undetected and untreated during the first few weeks of life, generally results in mental retardation and a variety of other abnormal conditions. Monetary costs of the detection and treatment program were compared with the projected benefits (avoided costs) that result from the prevention of the mental retardation associated with the disorder. Future costs and benefits were determined using a 4 per cent, 7 per cent, and 10 per cent rate of discount. Net benefits (benefits-costs) for detecting and treating one individual with PKU were $208,000 ($292,000-$84,000) using the 7 per cent rate of discount. Net benefits for detecting four individuals with PKU per year in Wisconsin totaled $832,000, a large rate of return on a relatively small investment. The issue of the potential economic implications of maternal PKU is briefly discussed.

Newborn screening programs directed toward the prevention of selected genetic, metabolic disorders through early detection and treatment have been demonstrated to be good economic investments in preventive health care (Barden et al., 1983; Bush et al., 1973; Conley and Milunsky, 1975; Laberge, 1980; Steiner and Smith, 1973). As the concern over rapidly rising costs of medical care increases, cost-benefit analysis is increasingly accepted as one way of economically evaluating existing and projected health programs. Although only a very small percentage (probably less than five per cent) of current expenditures for health care is directed toward prevention programs, some of these programs have the potential of substantially reducing health costs (Kristein, 1977). The following report analyzes the costs and benefits of screening for phenylketonuria (PKU) in Wisconsin.

(F0lling, 1934). F0lling discovered abnormal quantities of phenylpyruvic and phenylacetic acids in the urine of mentally retarded subjects who exuded a peculiar "mousy" odor. Although phenylketonuria was then thought to be a single abnormality of phenylalanine metabolism, it is now clear that there are different abnormalities involving phenylalanine metabolism. Most of these abnormalities are caused by mutations which reduce the activity of hepatic phenylalanine 4-hydroxylase, the enzyme that converts phenylalanine to tyrosine (Scriver and Clow, 1980). Recently a new group of disorders has been identified in which phenylalanine hydroxylase is normal, but defects are present in the metabolism of the coenzyme tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), which is required for the hydroxylation of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan (Bickel, 1982; Niederwieser et al., 1982).

Phenylketonuria (PKU) was first Phenylalanine is an essential amino identified in 1934 by Asbjorn F0lling acid for man. During early growth, a

portion of the daily intake of phenylalanine (less than 50 per cent) is used for protein synthesis. The remainder is mainly oxidized via the activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase to tyrosine, and, to a lesser extent, with the aid of other enzymes it is changed to other metabolites such as phenylpyruvic acid, phenylacetic acid, phenyllactic acid, and phenylethylamine. When the hydroxylation reaction is impaired, there is an abnormally high accumulation of phenylalanine in fluids of the body and the rate of metabolism of phenylalanine along minor pathways is greatly increased. The accumulation of phenylalanine and of normal metabolites in abnormal quantities results in many of the characteristics associated with phenylalanine disorders. Although the exact mechanism is not clear, biochemical abnormalities associated with the accumulation of phenylalanine and its derivatives is believed to be responsible for the irreversible arrest of differentiation of the central nervous system that results in the characteristic mental retardation associated with PKU (Scriver and Clow, 1980).
Mass screening of newborn infants for hyperphenylalaninemia has led to the realization that there is heterogeneity in mutations of phenylalanine hydroxylase and in other defects of phenylalanine metabolism. In order for treatment to be specific, it is necessary to distinguish classic phenylketonuria (PKU) from hyperphenylalaninemia variants and other conditions associated with elevated blood levels of phenylalanine (Levy and Mitchel, 1982). Individuals with classic PKU are defined as those who have very low ( < 1 per cent) phenylalanine hydroxylase activity in the liver and generally have blood levels of phenylalanine greater than 20 mg/100

ml (normal < 4mg/100ml) on a regular diet. Persistent nonphenylketonuric hyperphenylalaninemia (PKU variants) is a group of disorders manifested by less marked decreased activity of phenylalanine hydroxylase and levels of phenylalanine in the blood which range from 4-20 mg/100 ml while on a regular diet. Transient hyperphenylalaninemia is rare and is characterized by elevated phenylalanine levels in the newborn period which progressively decline toward normal. This transient type may be the result of a maturational delay in the hydroxylase enzyme (Tourian and Sidbury, 1978). PKU variants, depending on phenylalanine level, generally do not require long-term dietary treatment, although initial treatment may be necessary until the variants can be distinguished from the classic type. Treatment is initiated by most clinics when blood phenylalanine levels in the newborn period exceed 15 mg/100 ml (Schuett etal., 1983).
Classic untreated PKU is clinically associated with mental retardation and a variety of other abnormal conditions including: eczema, progressive diminution of pigment, delayed psychomotor development, seizures, hyperactivity and other behavioral manifestations, enamel hypoplasia, decalcification of the long bones, and growth retardation. (Knox, 1972; Paine, 1957; Partington, 1961). In one report the mean IQ level of untreated individuals with classic PKU was 40.2, with less than 4 per cent with IQ values above 60 (Bondy and Rosenberg, 1982). Tourian and Sidbury (1970) estimated that ultimately 96 to 98 per cent of PKU subjects would have an IQ less than 50, and the great majority would require custodial care. Bush et al. (1973) reported estimates of levels of retardation that were somewhat less se-

vere, i.e., 64 per cent of subjects had severe or profound mental retardation.
Although treatment with a low phenylalanine diet may, when initiated after the neonatal period, result in improvements in some of the signs and symptoms of PKU in a minority of patients, treatment with low phenylalanine diets must commence very early in postnatal development to prevent mental retardation (Baumeister, 1967; Knox, 1960,1972). For treatment to be most effective, it should be begun before three weeks of age. Unfortunately, before mass screening efforts, individuals were not identified until the deleterious effects on the brain were irreversible. During the first year of life, there were few specific clues that could be used to alert physicians to the presence of a PKU child.
Because of the severity of the mental retardation, most untreated PKU individuals require custodial care throughout their lifetimes and most are institutionalized. The life expectancy of the classic PKU individual is reduced, presumably in part because of the greatly increased risk of infectious disease in the institutional setting. Bondy and Rosenberg (1980) reported that 75 per cent of patients die before age 30. Fisch et al. (1976) studied 1,600 PKU individuals in 206 institutions in the United States and reported that from 1950-76 50 per cent died before 27 years of age. These death by age data provided by Fisch et al., have been used throughout the present cost-benefit analysis. Mass screening of newborns throughout the United States and successful dietary treatment of detected children has made mental retardation caused by PKU a rare occurrence. If untreated PKU were a problem today, the life expectancy of young retarded individuals with PKU would

probably be longer than that reported by Fisch et al., 1976). An increased lifespan would increase the benefit (avoided cost) side of the benefit-cost equation.
Most types of hyperphenylalaninemias, including classic PKU, are presumably the result of an autosomal recessive genetic defect. However, the presence of two different mutant alleles at the same locus or at two loci involved in the hydroxylase reaction is nearly certainly the cause for one or more hyperphenylalaninemia variants (Bondy and Rosneberg, 1980).
The incidence of classic PKU in the United States is approximately 1/17,000 live births (Schuett et al., 1983). The reported incidence in other countries ranges from 1/6,000 in Belgium and West Germany to 1/19,000 in Israel. The mean for nineteen countries was approximately 1/11,800 live births (Tourian and Sidbury, 1978). PKU is common among Irish and Polish people, but is rare among American blacks and Ashkenazic Jews (Levy and Mitchell, 1982). Heterozygosity for phenylketonuria does not appear to dispose individuals to a greater frequency of mental retardation (Perry, 1965). Woolf et al., (1975) proposed that female heterozygote carriers of the gene may have enhanced fertility.
The law mandating expanded newborn screening in Wisconsin was enacted in 1977. PKU screening in Wisconsin began in 1966. Since the mandated testing program was initiated on May 16, 1978, over 300,000 infants have been tested for phenylketonuria (PKU) and three other disorders (galactosemia, maple syrup urine disease, and neonatal hypothyroidism). In most cases blood is drawn in the hospital prior to discharge. Blood is drawn by heel

prick and placed infivespots on a standard form and sent to the State Laboratory of Hygiene for analysis.
An automated fluorometric analysis described by Hill et al. (1965) is used to test the concentration of phenylalanine. If levels are greater than 4 mg/100 ml a repeat sample is obtained and analyzed. Studies have shown that although concentrations of blood phenylalanine are not elevated at birth, newborn infants show elevated levels within 24-48 hours (Levy and Mitchell, 1982) and show consistent increases in phenylalanine concentrations over the first fourteen days of age. Thus, the reliability of the PKU screen is dramatically improved with increasing age (McCabe et al., 1983). Individuals with elevated levels are referred to one of three metabolic disease centers (Waisman Center, Madison; Milwaukee Children's Hospital, Milwaukee; Marshfield Clinic, Marshfield) for further analysis and, if necessary, long-term dietary treatment. In cases where the initial blood phenylalanine level is sufficiently elevated, the infant is immediately placed in the care of a metabolic disease center and the second repeat sample is obtained and analyzed there.
The following is an effort to outline the costs and benefits of screening for classic phenylketonuria in Wisconsin. The ability afforded by the screening program of also detecting individuals with hyperphenylalaninemia variants and other conditions associated with elevated levels of phenylalanine is an additional, undetermined benefit of the screening program. Although individuals with PKU variants generally do not require long-term treatment and are not mentally retarded, the identification of females with a PKU variant condition is important in regard to prevention of fu-

ture problems associated with maternal PKU (see below).
COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS
Cost-benefit analysis provides an estimate of the potential economic value of a particular program, in this case PKU screening and treatment. Monetary costs of running the detection and treatment program are compared with expected benefits which accrue from early detection, treatment, and prevention of the untreated PKU. In the present analysis, costs and benefits are presented to determine a net benefit value. Net benefits are derived by subtracting the costs of detecting and treating individuals with PKU from the benefits (net benefits = benefits -costs). Costs and benefits are presented to reflect the cost per sample and cost per detection of PKU; benefits represent the avoided costs that accrue from preventing the harmful characteristics of PKU for each detected individual. All values are expressed in 1982 dollars. Where 1982 figures were not available, the most recent figures were inflated to 1982 levels by using the gross national product deflator for each intervening year (Statistical Abstracts of the United States, 1981).
Because the costs of a health program which occur in the present must be evaluated against the benefits of preventing or avoiding the costs of impairments of health that occur in the future, cost-benefit analyses must incorporate an appropriate discount rate to achieve comparability between the present and future costs. The discounting process provides a link between present costs and expected future benefits (Sorkin, 1975). Discounting is necessary because a given amount of money today is worth

more than that same amount at some time in the future. The difference between the present amount and the value of that money in the future represents the lost opportunity value of the money involved. Assuming a 7 per cent discount rate, a $1,000 benefit that occurs in one year's time is worth only $935 in terms of present value; a $935 investment today would be worth $1,000 in one year's time. Similarly, a $1,000 benefit that will occur in 10 years is worth only $508 in terms of present value. The present value of %Y accruing in n years in the future at a discount rate of 7 per cent is calculated as $Y/(1.07)n (Hartunian et al., 1981). Because of discounting, costs and benefits that occur in the distant future are relatively less significant in terms of present value than costs and benefits that occur in the present or near future (see Estaugh, 1981, for a discussion of discount rates.)
The appropriate discount rate to use in cost-benefit analysis is a matter of considerable concern. High discount rates give more weight to present costs than to future benefits (avoided costs). Low discount rates give more weight to costs that must be borne by future generations. A high discount rate will cause programs with high present costs and with benefits that occur in the future to be less attractive economically than programs with both costs and benefits occurring in the present or near future. Some investigators feel that the discount rate should reflect the average rate of growth of the gross national product, i.e., 3--4 per cent (Andreano and McCollum, 1983; Gramlich, 1981). Others suggest that the discount rate should more closely reflect the rate of inflation or rate of interest that could be obtained from a high quality bond or other private sector investment, i.e., 7-10 per

cent. In some cost-benefit analyses several discount rates may be used and the decision concerning which rate is appropriate for evaluation of a particular program is left to the policymaker. In the present study, discount rates of 4 per cent, 7 per cent, and 10 per cent were calculated. Tables and narrative use the 7 per cent rate. Notations of values associated with the other discount rates appear as footnotes of the relevant tables.
An important issue concerning costs and benefits of preventing a genetic disorder is that of reproductive "compensation" or "replacement." In the case of genetic disorders that are prevented by termination of pregnancy, the projected lifetime costs of an individual with a disorder such as Down's syndrome can be viewed to be influenced by whether or not the affected fetus is "replaced" by an infant with a normal genotype (Hook, 1979). Andreano and McCollum (1983) concluded that the replacement case was not a relevant consideration when determining the gross benefits of an amniocentesis program. However, in calculations concerning PKU, the abnormal PKU child is essentially "replaced" by a normal one as a result of early detection and successful dietary treatment. Therefore, in calculating benefits (avoided costs) of PKU screening the costs of care and education of a normal person were subtracted from the costs of care and special education of the untreated PKU individual. Special education costs were calculated as additional costs beyond the normal costs of education. Normal consumption costs were subtracted from the special costs of residential care and services required by a mentally retarded individual. Similarly, the difference between the earnings of an average normal individual and the expected earnings of an

individual with untreated PKU constitutes lost productivity and is included as a benefit when the "replacement" situation applies (Hook, 1979). Lost productivity amounted to a significant portion of the total benefits that resulted from the PKU screening program.
PROGRAM COSTS
The costs of a program designed to prevent the overt manifestations of phenylketonuria included the cost of screening and detection and the subsequent costs of long-term treatment of those detected. Screening and detection costs included the costs related to the collection of the blood specimen and the costs incurred for laboratory testing. Because the specimen was collected while the mother and baby were in the hospital following birth, no additional costs related to transportation to the hospital, foregone earnings of the mother, and child care were included (Stoddart, 1982). Treatment costs for individuals with PKU included the cost for the required low phenylalanine dietary supplement and costs related to frequent blood tests, physician fees, and nutritional consultations.
COLLECTION COSTS

cause this one collection provided blood specimens for four screening tests, the cost for the PKU portion was $1.15 ($4.60/4).
LABORATORY COSTS
Laboratory costs for testing for PKU were estimated to be $1.34 per sample (Table 1). This cost included personnel salaries, supplies and expenses, and overhead. The laboratory costs have been divided among the four test procedures according to the personnel commitment of time (FTE) and cost of supplies associated with each particular test.
When an initial test for phenylalanine is elevated, a recall test must be done to verify the initial finding. The cost per recall was estimated to be $40.00, and included a $10.00 charge for the PKU test, $10.00 for travel expenses, and a $20.00 clinic charge. The recall rate in Wisconsin was estimated to be less than 0.1% (170/300,000 investigated samples). The recall cost per initial sample tested was thus $0.04 (0.001 x $40.00).
The sum of the collecting and testing costs was the cost of processing each sample. This cost was estimated to be $2.53 ($1.15 + $1.34 + $0.04) for the period July 1, 1981 through June 30,

The actual costs involved in collecting the specimen in the hospital were estimated to be approximately $4.60 per collection. This cost was determined by a time study at three Madison, Wisconsin, hospitals. Costs included estimated costs for drawing blood, administration costs, medical record costs, supplies, billing costs, and overhead. Estimates for the three hospitals were $4.11, $4.54, and $4.60. Similar estimates from other Wisconsin hospitals could be more, or less, than those above. Be-

1982. The cost of detecting a case of PKU is related to the incidence of PKU in Wisconsin. The average incidence of PKU (classic type) for the years 1978-82 was approximately 1/17,000 (Table 2). The cost for detecting each case of PKU was thus approximately $43,000 (17,000 x $2.53) (Table 10).
TREATMENT COSTS

Treatment costs included a number of expenses related to the long-term care of individuals with PKU. The most significant expense was the low phenylalanine dietary supplement that must be used. The diet must be carefully regulated to maintain blood levels of phenylalanine within the 3 mg to 10 mg/100 ml range. Levels below 3 mg/100 ml have been associated with poor growth and development, neurologic symptoms, enlargement of the liver, and frequent infections (Dodge et al., 1975). For the purposes of this analysis, twenty yearsof maintenance on the diet was calculated. In many cases, the low phenylalanine di-

During the period 1978 through 1982 approximately 295,000 individuals were tested. The incidence of classic PKU = 1/17,000. The incidence of hyperphenylalanemia variants = 1/15,500. The incidence of all individuals with hyperphenylalanemia = 1/8000.

etary supplement would be discontinued before twenty years. However, because of the present uncertainty concerning how long the dietary supplements should be continued to maintain optimal development, a lengthy, conservative time span was utilized. A recent survey indicated that 64 per cent of ninety United States clinics recommended an indefinite diet for males; 72 per cent of these same clinics recommended an indefinite diet for females (Schuettetal.,1983).
Treatment costs for a twenty-year period, discounted at 7 per cent, were estimated to be approximately $40,830 (Table 3). Treatment costs included expenditures for the low phenylalanine dietary supplements and additional expenses related to the need for frequent blood analyses, travel expenses related to periodic evaluation, and fees for physicians, nutritionists, and genetic counselors. These treatment costs were assessed at a university-affiliated research facility (Waisman Center, Madison) and may be somewhat higher than those incurred at other treatment centers. The combined costs for the detection and treatment for each individual with classic PKU was estimated to be approximately $84,000 (Table 10).
BENEFITS
The benefits that result from the detection and successful treatment of an individual with PKU are represented by the total cost of the disease (untreated PKU). These costs generally comprise three elements: (1) expenditures related to the lifelong care of an individual with untreated PKU; (2) loss of productivity resulting from premature death or disability; (3) the pain, suffering, and emotional deprivation associated with the

disease (Sorkin, 1975). This latter costis difficult to express in monetary terms, but itssocial value should notbe forgotten when evaluating any prevention program. Large unmeasured social benefits should beasimportant ascost savingsin the determination of the fate of a proposed program. Benefits which can more readily be expressed in monetary terms include: cost of institutional care, cost of foster care, cost of adult residential care andservices, cost of specialeducation, lost productivity of the affected individual, and lost productivity ofthe mother.
The avoided costs ofinstitutional and residential care andservices for anindividual with PKU represent a major component of the benefits associated with a successful PKU detection program. In order to accurately estimate these costs over the lifetime of an individual, one must take into account the relatively high mortality experienced by individuals with PKU inthe institutional setting. Unfortunately, good life tables for PKU individuals are not available. For the purpose of this report, survival rates were derived from a study ofthe age at death for institutionalized PKU individuals (Fisch et al., 1976). These figures reflect past mortality rates and

probably do not reflect the improved life expectancy that might beexpected from improvements in medical knowledge at the present time and in the future. Improvements in lifespan would increase the benefits ina cost benefit analysis.
Estimated level ofmental retardation must also beconsidered when determining benefits (avoided costs). For the present analysis, theestimated percentage ofindividuals with PKU with severe or profound mental retardation was 64 per cent; 36 per cent ofPKU individuals were placed inthemoderately tomildly mentally retarded category. These estimates follow the judgement of nationally recognized PKUauthorities (Bush et al., 1973). Other investigators have placed theestimate of the percentageof individuals with severe or profound mental retardation at considerably higher levels (Bondy and Rosenberg, 1980). The levels used in the present study should be considered conservative. The level ofretardation expected is important when estimating the percentage of PKU individuals whowould require institutional care, foster care,and ultimately adult residential care and services. Special education costs also vary according to thelevel of mentalretardation.

"Lifetime productivity figures were derived from Conley, (1973) andbrought to 1982 levels byapplying the annual percent changes inwage rates forthe period from 1971-81 (Statistical Abstracts ofthe United States,1981). Conley'sfigureswere basedon the following assumptions:
(a) Earnings of mildly retarded were comparable to the earnings of the general population to age 25. Thereafter, earnings decline to86 per cent of normal formales and 87 per cent of normal for females.
(b) Earnings of moderately retarded workers were 20 per cent of normal. (c)Employment rates formildly retarded workers were the same as forthe general population up to the age of25. Thereafter they were 4per cent below average formales and 12 per cent below average for females. (d) Employment rates among moderately retarded workers were 45 per cent of normal for males and 12 percent of normal rates for females. (e) Mortality rates were 25 per cent above normal for mildly retarded subjects and 75 per cent above normal for moderately retarded subjects; (f) The value of unpaid work was 25 per cent of gross earnings for men and 37.5 percent of gross earnings for women. The unpaid productivity forwomen mainly represented homemaking services.
^Lifetime productivity figures were additionally discounted at 7 percent rate for the years 1982-2000, the 18 years before
productivity begins. Lost produaivityfiguresfor4 percent ($91,700) and 10per cent ($41,710) were estimates based on extrapola-
tion from 7per cent figures of Conley (1973).

preventing the disabling effects of PKU. The value of the estimated lifetime productivity of workers was derived from Conley (1973). 1982 values were determined by applying annual per cent changes in wage rates for the period from 1971 through 1981 (Statistical Abstracts of the United States, 1981). The productivity figures were based on a number of assumptions that are listed in Table 8. Lost lifetime productivity values were determined by subtracting the lifetime productivity estimates of the retarded subject from productivity figures

for the general population. For exampie, the discounted lifetime productivity of a normal male was estimated to be $117,100, compared to $11,390 for the productivity of a moderately retarded worker. In this case the lost lifetime productivity was estimated to be $105,710. For females the comparable figure was $33,230. Using the estimate that 82 per cent of PKU individuals would be moderately to profoundly mentally retarded and that 18 per cent would be mildly retarded, the lost lifetime earnings amounted to $60,000 (Table 9).

SUMMARY OF BENEFITS - COSTS
The net (benefits - costs) of detecting and successfully treating one case of PKU are presented in Table 10. Under Option I the net benefits amounted to $208,610; net benefits under Option II amounted to $140,170. In Wisconsin the annual savings that result from detecting four individuals with PKU were $832,000 under Option I and approximately $560,000 under the assumptions of Option II. Therefore, in regard to the PKU prevention program, relatively modest program costs were greatly offset by the estimated benefits of avoiding the serious consequences of the failure to detect and treat this genetic disorder. However, in order to fully benefit from the investment in a

successful PKU detection and treatment program, problems associated with reproduction by women with treated PKU and with untreated hyperphenylalaninemia must be understood.
MATERNAL PKU
Maternal phenylketonuria (mPKU) is a problem that could, in the future, significantly alter the favorable benefitcost figures outlined above. Maternal phenylketonuria is a condition which generally results in significant mortality and morbidity in the offspring of mothers with PKU/hyperphenylalaninemia who were not on a phenylalanine restricted diet prior to and during pregnancy. Microcephaly, mental retardation, cardiac anomalies, and intrauterine growth retardation are

among the most frequently reported of a variety of congenital anomalies which almost invariably occur in nonphenylketonuric offspring of mothers with elevated blood levels of phenylalanine. Heterozygous mothers have only minimal elevations of blood phenylalanine and generally have normal offspring (Howell and Stevenson, 1971; Lenke and Levy, 1980; Mabry et al., 1966). Although some phenylketonuric mothers who had a restricted intake of phenylalanine commencing either before or during early pregnancy have had apparently normal offspring; others have been less successful (Davidson et al., 1981; Komrower et al., 1979; Lenke and Levy, 1982; Nielsen et al., 1979). Not enough data are available to indicate whether the developing fetus can be totally protected by maternal dietary therapy. What is clear is that the added cost of dietary treatment and care of the

woman with PKU during pregnancy would be relatively small when compared to the long-term costs related to the care of a defective child. Close followup and genetic counseling of women with hyperphenylalaninemia should be a major priority of programs which have so successfully detected and treated individuals with PKU.
