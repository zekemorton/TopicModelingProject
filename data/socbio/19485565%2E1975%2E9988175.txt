Although there have been numerous investigations of the relationships between sibling constellation variables and intelligence, we still do not have a very clear understanding of how birth order and family size are related to intellectual performance. Our lack of understanding is primarily due to the serious methodological and statistical shortcomings of much of the research that has been undertaken so far.
When examining relationships between birth order and intelligence, investigators have generally restricted their samples to include two categories, first-borns and later-borns. Birth order research has also seldom taken into account other relevant variables, such as family size, social class, family density, and maternal age. Another limitation of sibling research has been the use of inadequate samples. Often the samples have been too small to allow sufficient numbers of families of different sizes to be included and too small to achieve sufficient numbers of individuals from different birth-order positions. Also, there have been few studies which have examined completed or nearly completed families.
However, inconsistent and inconclusive

results have been produced even from those few studies that have attempted to overcome some of the mentioned methodological limitations. Using data on approximately 43,000 American high-school students from the Project Talent study, Burton (1968) found that there were no consistent birth-order differences in intelligence test scores among socioeconomic categories and among family-size groupings. In a sample of 500 11-year-old Irish children, Kellaghan and Macnamarra (1972) found that social status, family size, and birth order all made significant contributions to differences in verbal reasoning scores, while in a survey of 700 15-year-old English students Murray (1971) discovered that after controlling for the effects of family size and social status, there were no significant differences between first-borns and later-borns on verbal and nonverbal tests.
In one of the most extensive sibling constellation studies yet undertaken, Belmont and Marolla (1973), using a conservative statistical analysis, found that in a sample of nearly 400,000 19-year-old Dutch males, birth order and family size had independent relationships with intellectual performance. The relationships be-

tween family size and intelligence were not found to be present in all social classes, but the relationships between birth order and intelligence were constant across social classes.
The findings from the above studies remain equivocal primarily because they have relied on the use of restricted statistical techniques. They have used productmoment correlations which reveal only bivariate relations and analysis of variance which requires the grouping of variables into levels. Simple additive multiple regression models have been used to examine how much extra variance in intelligence test scores is associated with the addition of sibling variables to the regression equations. However, the results generated from these regression equations rely on the order in which the sibling variables have been added to the equations. Thus, all of these statistical techniques have prevented the full character of the relationships of sibling variables, social class, and intelligence from being revealed.
One of the few pieces of sibling research to use complex statistical models found that hyperbolic regression equations including father's occupation, the inverse of the size of the family, and the product of these two variables accounted for as much significant variance in verbal and number ability scores as complex many-termed equations containing other sibling and social status variables, their quadratics (to test for nonlinearity), and their products (to test for interactions). However, the latter research was restricted by the use of a small sample and, in part, by the order in which the variables were entered into the regression models (Marjoribanks and Walberg, 1975a, 19756).
In the present study, an attempt is
made to overcome both the methodological

and statistical shortcomings of previous sibling research. Complex multiple regression models are used to examine the relationships among the birth order, family size, social class, and the intelligence test scores of the Dutch males investigated in the Belmont and Marolla (1973) research. The nature and the size of the sample, approximately 400,000 19-year-olds, allows many of the methodological restrictions of previous research to be eliminated, while many of the statistical limitations are overcome by constructing regression surfaces from regression models which include terms to account for the possible interaction and curvilinear relationships among intelligence, family size, birth order, and social class.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
As reported in the Belmont and Marolla study, the sample consisted of approximately 400,000 19-year-old men. They represented nearly all male survivors of children born in the Netherlands from 1944 to 1947, who were still living in the Netherlands at the time they reached 19 years of age. It is reasonable to assume that virtually all of their respective families were complete at that time.
When they reached the age of 19, the men were required to complete a battery of tests as part of an examination to determine their fitness for military training. In the present study, the scores from the Raven Progressive Matrices (Dutch modification with 40 items) are used. The raw scores from the test were grouped by the Dutch military into six classifications. In the present analysis, the scores range from a low of 1 to a high score of 6.
Social class data are based on father's occupation at the time of the military examination and have been classified into three social groups: nonmanual (professionals and white-collar workers); man-

ual (skilled, semiskilled, and unskilled workers); and farm (farmers and farm laborers).
Family size is classified into nine categories. Category one represents a onechild family, category two indicates a family with two children, and so on, to category eight which represents a family of eight children. Category nine indicates a family with nine or more children. Birth order is also classified into nine categories, with category one representing a first-born child, and so on, with category eight indicating that the subject was the eighth child born into the family. Category nine indicates that the subject's birth order in the family was either ninth or greater than ninth. The final sample included 386,114 19-year-old males who had data on birth order, family size, social class, and scores on the intelligence test.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION One of the oldest theories in sibling research claims that an only child in a family is different from all children with siblings. In some sense, only children can as justifiably be classified youngest as oldest. Because of the difficulty of classification, many investigators have excluded only children from their analyses while others have treated them as first-borns. In preliminary analyses of the Dutch data, we found that when singletons were included, mental ability scores could not be very well fitted to family size. However, when the singletons were excluded from the analysis, there was a quadratic fit between ability scores and family size. We found that the scores for the singletons were much lower than we would have predicted. The results suggest a cautious and tentative speculation, that a number of the single-borns may have been mentally deficient at birth, which influenced the parents not to have further children.

Because we found the singletons to be an exceptional case, we removed them from the remainder of the analysis.
In the first analysis (excluding singletons), multiple regression models are used which include the intelligence scores as the criterion variable with the predictors being social class, family size, birth order, the squares of the sibling variables, and the products of the predictors. The relationships between the predictor variables and the intelligence scores are examined in terms of the significance of raw regression weights rather than the significance of standardized regression weights (see Table 1). As Schoenberg (1972, p. 4) suggests, when different subsamples are being compared, as in the present study, then: "It is simply not legitimate to compare standardized measures across different samples since any difference in such measures may just as likely be attributable to differences in variances as to differences in effects."
The significance of the relations between the predictors and the intelligence scores is determined by evaluating the absolute value, \t\, of the ratio of the raw regression weight (b), to its standard error (e). In the present study, the S per cent critical value for \t\ is 1.960 while the 1 per cent critical value is 2.576 (see Draper and Smith, 1966).
The results shown in Table 1 indicate significant relationships between social class and intelligence test scores and also significant linear and quadratic relationships among family size, birth order, and intelligence. Also, the intelligence scores are related to family-size and birth-order interactions with social class. The significant interaction terms in Table 1 show that the slopes of the mental ability scores on family size and birth order differ in the three social class groups. Therefore, we

examined separately the relationships of intelligence scores, family size, and birth order ·within each of the three social class groups.
For the separate analysis in each social class, group regression models were used which included as predictors: family size, birth order, and the product and squares of the two sibling variables. The findings in Table 2 show that between the social class groups, family size and birth order have differential relationships with the intelligence test scores. For example, in the nonmanual and manual social groups, family size and birth order are related to intelligence, while in the farm social group, family size is not related to intelligence. Intelligence is related to the square of birth order in the manual and farm groups and related to the square of family size in the nonmanual social class group. The interaction between family size and birth order was not related to the intelligence scores in any of the social class groups.
From the results presented in Table 2, a set of regression surfaces were constructed to show the linear and quadratic relationships of family size, birth order, and intelligence within each social class group (see Figures 1, 2, and 3). The

curvature of each surface indicates that, within each social class group, as birth order increases there is a gradual decline in the intelligence test scores. However, in the manual (Fig. 2) and farm (Fig. 3) social groups, the curvilinear relationship between birth order and intelligence is such that the successive decrements in test scores become smaller as birth order increases, while in the nonmanual (Fig. 1) group the successive decrements in intelligence become greater as birth order increases.
The relationships between family size and intelligence for the nonmanual and manual social class groups, shown in Figures 1 and 2, support previous research (e.g., Anastasi, 1956; Cicirelli, 1967; Nisbet and Entwistle, 1967; Record et al., 1969; Douglas, 1968; Kennett and Cropley, 1970) which has shown that the relationship between family size and intellectual performance is attenuated as the socioeconomic status of families increases. For example, the present results indicate that the intelligence test scores of children from quite small families within the manual social class group are lower than test scores of children from large families within the nonmanual social class group. Such a finding provides the possible basis

for a partial explanation of the results of an investigation of British university graduates by Poole and Kuhn (1973). They found that for university graduates with a middle class background a relatively large family does not constitute a barrier to educational achievement, whereas for the son or daughter of a manual worker a small family of one or two children is virtually a precondition of educational success in the form of a university degree.
The results of the present study emphasize the complexity of the interrelationships of social class, birth order, fam-

ily size, and intelligence. Previous sibling research has tended to concentrate on the investigation of either birth order or family size rather than both together, and much of the research has failed to consider the influence of these two variables within different social class groups. By using complex multiple regression models to construct regression surfaces, the present study has been able to overcome many of the limitations of prior investigations and has led to a greater understanding of the relations between sibling variables and intelligence.

models have been used, the findings have depended on the order in which measures of family size, birth order, and social class have been added to the equations. By using raw regression weights as the basis of analysis, the present study has allowed the full nature of the interrelations of family size, birth order, and intelligence in different social class groups to be examined. Whereas many previous studies have concluded that sibling variables have low to moderate linear relationships with intelligence, the present results suggest that when curvilinear, interaction, and linear relationships are analyzed, then both family size and birth order have sizable differential relationships with intelligence in different social class groups.

SUMMARY
Serious methodological and statistical limitations of sibling research have impeded previous research on how sibling characteristics are related to intelligence. A study by Belmont'and Marolla (1973) overcame many of the methodological shortcomings of prior research, but the study relied on a conservative statistical analysis which prevented the character of the relationships between the variables from being revealed. By using complex multiple regression models to construct regression surfaces, the present study shows that family size and birth order have differential linear and quadratic relationships with intelligence in different social class groups.
