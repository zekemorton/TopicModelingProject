ABSTRACT: Associations of measures of grandparental status, parental status, cognitive abilities, and personality, and own cognitive abilities and personality with educational and occupational attainment are reported for 249 offspring, now 25 years or older, from the Hawaii Family Study of Cognition (HFSC). In general, across two ethnic groups (Americans of European ancestry (AEA) and Americans of Japanese ancestry (AJA)), the data suggest that family background had a relatively trivial influence, own cognitive abilities (particularly verbal ability and general intelligence) substantial influence, and own personality some influence on the educational and occupational attainment of males, while family background had a far more substantial influence than own ability on the attainment of females. Educational attainment was generally found to be substantially predictive of occupational attainment. Hierarchal multiple regression analyses were conducted to assess the influence of parents' abilities over and above grandparental status and the influence of offsprings' abilities over and above parental status and abilities on their respective educational and occupational attainments. These analyses also indicated that family background was a much greater influence than own ability on the attainment of AEA female parents and both AEA and AJA female offspring. These findings for female offspring were further confirmed by analyses of parent-offspring and within-sibship differences in attainment.

A major practical question to be answered in studies of individual differences in educational and occupational attainment is to establish the extent to which one's own abilities over and above one's family background are predictive of occupational success, i.e., the extent to which one's society permits social mobility based on merit. Related to this question is the extent to which the educational opportunities provided by one's society are predictive of occupational success over and above one's family background and own abilities. The few reported large-scale studies of factors influencing occupational attainment have been supportive of a moder-

ate but not high degree of social mobility through merit in the United States. Studies by Jencks et al. (1972) and Jencks (1979) using census and sibling data for males only, Bachman et al. (1978) using a longitudinal design (males only), Behrman et al. (1980) using male twin pairs, and Hauser et al. (1982) using same- and opposite-sex sibling pairs have found that at least half of the explained variation in attainment was attributable to family background (genetic or shared family environment factors), although most of these studies also found significant influences of own cognitive abilities and education over and above family background on occu-

pational attainment. A considerable amount of the variation in attainment is not accounted for by these factors, and Jencks et al. (1972) have suggested that "luck" may be an important factor.
In a previous report (Johnson et al., 1983) we assessed the influence of family background, own cognitive abilities, and own personality on the educational and occupational attainments of the parents in the Hawaii Family Study of Cognition (HFSC). The HFSC involved the testing of 6,581 individuals from 1,816 families (both parents and one or more biological offspring at least 13 years of age) on a battery of 15 tests of cognitive ability (see DeFries et al., 1979, and Wilson et al., 1975, for further descriptions of the HFSC). All subjects also completed a questionnaire on the home environment, and well over half of them were administered a standardized measure of personality, the Adjective Check List (ACL) (Gough and Heilbrun, 1965). In the report on HFSC parental attainment we concluded that family background (the parents' father's education and occupation and mother's education) had a relatively trivial influence, own cognitive abilities a substantial influence, and own personality some influence on educational and occupational attainment. Results were generally consistent across sexes and ethnic groups (Americans of European ancestry (AEA) vs. Americans of Japanese ancestry (AJA)), although own cognitive ability had considerably less influence on the attainment of AEA women (many of whom did not work outside the home, suggesting the presence of restrictions on social mobility based on merit for this group). In all cases, the majority of the variance in attainment was not accounted for by the variables used.

The HFSC families were tested during the years 1973-76, and all of the offspring are now young adults. The present report presents analyses of data obtained in a 1983 mail-out questionnaire to a significant portion of the original HFSC families on the educational and occupational attainment of tested offspring. As will be described below, analyses were limited to those offspring who were 25 years of age or older in 1983. Even with this restriction, however, it is likely that most of the offspring had not reached their final occupational level, although most had reached their final educational level, and their results are not entirely comparable to those of their middle-aged parents. Given this caveat, we've used this offspring attainment data, as well as further analyzed the parent attainment data, to address the following questions.
1. To what extent do parental cognitive abilities and personality influence offspring educational and occupational attainment? As has been found in several studies, including Johnson et al. (1983), one's own cognitive abilities and personality are significantly related to one's attainment, so it is to be expected that parental ability and personality are important components of the genetic and environmental familial endowment that would have a "conservative" effect on offspring attainment and social mobility. Few previous studies have considered these parental variables in their assessments of the relative influence of family background on attainment.
2. To what extent have the relative and absolute influence of family background vs. one's own cognitive abilities and personality on educational and occupational attainment changed across generations? Although this comparison is confounded by age differences be-

tween the parent and offspring samples, these results would still be suggestive of the extent to which degree of meritocracy has changed in American society (as represented by Hawaii) during the decades between the time the HFSC parents were entering the job market and the present.
3. To what extent are the relative and absolute influence of family background vs. one's own cognitive abilities and personality on educational and occupational attainment comparable across sexes and the two major racial/ethnic groups in Hawaii, Americans of European ancestry and Americans of Japanese ancestry? As noted above, in the analyses of HFSC parental attainment (Johnson et al., 1983), there was some evidence for greater restrictions on social mobility based on merit for AEA women. Historical changes, such as the Women's Liberation movement, might be expected to have lessened or eliminated this sex difference in the influences on attainment of HFSC offspring. Johnson et al. (1983,1985) have described how historical changes in social status in Hawaii during the past forty years have been much greater for the AJA than for the AEA group. The parents of the HFSC parents of Japanese ancestry were of considerably lower educational and occupational attainment than the parents of the HFSC parents of Caucasian ancestry, but the two HFSC parent groups were very similar in their mean attainment. Notably, this greater upward social mobility for the AJA group was reflected in a somewhat greater influence of own ability on AJA than on AEA attainment. Since AEA and AJA HFSC offspring were reared in families of comparable social status, it would be expected that the relative influence of family background vs.

own ability and personality on attainment should be similar for the two offspring groups.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
SUBJECTS
We have the current addresses of approximately 1,200 of the 1,816 original HFSC families. About half of the lost families are military families, almost all Caucasian, tested during the first year of testing (a five-year residency requirement was added after this first year). Short questionnaires concerning the educational and occupational attainments of offspring were mailed to 437 families for whom we had current addresses. Families were chosen on two, largely overlapping bases: (1) having taken part in a 1976 summer retest session (additional data were available for these subjects) and (2) date of testing (we began seeking subjects tested at the beginning of the second year of testing and contacted subjects from that point until postage monies were expended). Fourteen questionnaires were not deliverable because of incorrect addresses, with 309 of the remaining 423 families completing and returning their questionnaires. Reminder letters were sent to the 114 families that did not respond. Forty-four more families completed and returned their questionnaires following this reminder for a total of 353 families responding (83.5 per cent of those families contacted).
These families had a total of 561 offspring who took part in the HFSC, with 213 of these offspring 24 years of age or younger. Preliminary analyses (which will be briefly reported below) indicated a cutting point seemed to be present at age 25. At 24 or younger most of the subjects were probably still influx--ifin

college, still undergraduates, or if employed, employed at what were likely to be temporary types of jobs. No magic change occurs at age 25, but we found far stronger evidence of permanence with regard to educational attainment and occupational stability among subjects 25 years of age or older. Though this is admittedly a somewhat arbitrary cut, we felt that enough of a qualitative difference existed between persons 25 years of age or older, as opposed to 24 years of age or younger, that we have limited our analyses to the 249 subjects 25 years of age or older from the two major ethnic groups in the HFSC, Americans of European and Japanese ancestries. The ages, sexes, and racial/ ethnic backgrounds of these subjects are presented in Table 1. Data are also reported separately for unmarried vs. married subjects.

MEASURES
We had comparatively few measures of the HFSC parents' family background. These were the reported years of education of these parents' mothers and fathers and the reported occupational attainment of their fathers, i.e., the reported attainments of the grandparents of the HFSC offspring. Much more information is available regarding the family background of the offspring. All parents provided information regarding their own educational and occupational attainments, all parents were tested on the battery of cognitive measures described below, and the majority of parents provided personality data as well (also described below). Educational level of the offspring was coded using the following scale: (1) some high school, (2) high school graduate, (3)

some college, (4) college graduate, (5) some post-graduate education, and (6) post-graduate degree. These codes were then converted into years of education for comparability with the parent data. Occupational level was scored through National Opinion Research Council (NORC) ratings (Reiss et al., 1961) for the grandfathers, the parents, and the offspring. The mean years of education and NORC ratings of the HFSC offspring used in the present analyses are also reported in Table 1.
The measures of cognition consisted of 15 cognitive tests (see DeFries et al., 1979; Wilson et al., 1975, for a description of these measures). These tests loaded on four factors--Verbal Ability, Spatial Ability, Perceptual Speed and Accuracy, and Visual Memory Ability (DeFries et al., 1979; Wilson et al., 1975). The unrotated first principal component correlated 0.73 with full scale Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale scores and may be regarded as a measure of general intelligence (Kuse, 1977). All cognition factor scores were age-corrected by standardizing scores within age bands.
The personality data consist of factor scores derived from the Adjective Check List (ACL) (Gough and Heilbrun, 1965). The ACL was routinely administered during several years of testing to a total of 3,411 subjects. The ACL is a 300-adjective checklist originally scored by Gough and Heilbrun to yield 24 scale scores. Because of criticisms with regard to the lack of independence and poor psychometric properties of these scales (Masterson, 1975), it was decided to rescore the 300 items of the ACL, using the results of an item factor analysis by Parker and Veldman (1969). Parker and Veldman's analyses yielded the follow-

ing seven factors, for which alpha reliability coefficients calculated on the 3,411 HFSC individuals who took the ACL, the number of adjectives loading on the factor, and some representative adjectives are given in parentheses: Social Desirability (0.90; 28 items; pleasant, kind, warm); Interpersonal Abrasiveness (0.65; 9 items; rude, lazy, foolish); Ego Organization (0.87; 20 items; industrious, thorough, efficient); Introversion-Extraversion (0.66; 8 items; quiet, silent vs. talkative, outgoing); Internal Discomfort (0.79; 14 items; emotional, nervous, worrying); Intraception (0.71; 9 items; reflective, unconventional, idealistic); and Social Attractiveness (0.76; 10 items; polished, clever, charming). The seven scale scores were empirically corrected for the total number of adjectives checked by obtaining the linear and quadratic regression coefficients of each raw scale score on the number of adjectives checked for the entire sample and computing the residuals for each scale. Since all seven of the scales were significantly correlated with age, even after the correction for number of adjectives checked, the scale scores were also age-corrected by removing, via regression, the linear and quadratic components due to age. All scale scores were then converted to standard scores, and the analyses presented herein are based on these standard scores.
RESULTS
The correlations of grandparent education and occupation, parent cognitive abilities, ACL factors, education, and occupation, and own cognitive abilities and ACL factors on offspring educational and occupational attainment (plus the correlation of own education

with occupation) are presented separately by sex and ethnicity (AEA vs. AJA) in Table 2. Variables equivalent to those used in Johnson et al. (1983) to predict HFSC parents' educational and occupational attainment have been underlined for comparison purposes. In general these correlations are similar to those found by Johnson et al. (1983) with regard to parent attainment, indicating a small but fairly consistent influenceof family background, a substantial influence of own verbal ability and general intelligence, and some influence of own personality on offspring attainment. As noted above, we were concerned about the effect of age on these correlations. To test for this, the above correlations were run separately on the entire offspring sample for males and females 20 to 24 years of age, 25 and 26 years of age, and 27 to 40 years of age. The overall findings from these analyses were that the 20 to 24 year groups had more significant correlations of parental attributes with achievement (18 out of 104 vs. 15 out of 104 for the 25 and 26 year groups and 10 out of 104 for the 27 + year groups) and fewer significant correlations of own attributes with achievement (7 out of 50 vs. 12 out of 50

for the 25 and 26 year groups and 16 out of 50 for the 27 + year groups) than did older subjects. These findings seem to support the reasons cited above for limiting our analyses to subjects 25 years of age and older.
One advantage of using the present age range of subjects is that a significant proportion of them had not yet married, allowing for analyses of the effect of early vs. late (or non-) marriage on educational and occupational attainment. The small sample number does not permit analyses of the influence of marital status on attainment separately by ethnic groups, but the proportions of unmarried vs. married persons were similar across the AEA and AJA groups. As can be discerned in Table 1, however, substantially more females than males have married, and sex differences in mean educational and occupational attainment differ across marital status. Analyses of variance of offspring educational and occupational attainment by sex and marital status revealed no significant main effects, but did produce significant interactions for both educational ( F = 15.42, d f = l , 208, p <0.001) and occupational (F=4.49, df = 1, 208, p <0.05) attainment, such

that married males had more education and were higher in occupational attainment than unmarried males, while the reverse was true for females. This may mean that males still are viewed as the primary providers in a marriage and are more often expected to postpone marriage until they can fulfill this role. The correlations of grandparent attainment, parent attainment, cognitive abilities, and personality, and own cognitive abilities and personality with offspring educational and occupational attainment are presented separately by sex and marital status in Table 3. In general, both family background and own ability appeared to have a greater influence on the attainment of unmarried as opposed to married males, while the reverse was true for females. As was also the case in Table 2, mother's education and occupation were substantially correlated with the attainment of female offspring.
Since a major focus of the present analyses was to assess the extent to which own cognitive ability and personality was predictive of offspring educational and occupational attainment over and above the influence of family back-

ground, hierarchical multiple regression analyses similar to those used in the Johnson et al. (1983) report on parent attainment were also performed on the offspring data. In the regressions used in the Johnson et al. report parent educational attainment was regressed on grandfather education and NORC code and grandmother education entered as a block in the first step, parent first principal component (general intelligence) was entered as the second step, and parent personality scales were entered as a block in stepwise order in the third step, retaining only those scales that accounted for a significant (p <0.05) amount of additional explained variance. The regressions on parent occupational attainment were similar, except that parents' own education was entered as the third step before entering personality. These regressions were done separately by sex and ethnic group (AEA vs. AJA). For comparison purposes, Tables 4 and 5reproduce the Johnson et al. multiple regression results for the sample of HFSC parents administered the ACL.

ment on family background (parentvariables) and own cognitive ability and personality were similar to those used in Johnson et al. (1983), except that midparent first principal component scores were entered as the first step before entering theother family background variables, father education and NORC and mother education. Mother NORC was again not used, since many mothers, particularly in the AEA group, did not work outside of the home. The results of these regression analyses on offspring attainment are presented in Tables 6

and 7. Some caution should be exercised in comparing the parent and offspring results, both because of the age confound mentioned earlier and because the numbers are considerably smaller for the offspring sample. The magnitudes of the influence of family background vs. own cognitive ability on attainment aresimilar between the parent and offspring generations. However, in contrast to theparent results, theeducational and occupational attainment of both AEA and AJA female offspring seem to be more influenced by family

background and less so by own ability than was the case with male offspring. Few ACL scales accounted for a significant amount of additional explained variance in predicting offspring attainment, but this may have been due to the small sample sizes. The total amount of variance accounted for by the variables fluctuates more for the offspring than for the parent regressions, which is probably another function of the sample size, but in no case is a majority of the

variance in attainment accounted for and in general the magnitudes are similar across generations.
Two further tests of the finding that the attainment of female offspring was less influenced by their own ability than wasthe case for male offspring were also conducted. The first test involved assessing the correlation between parentoffspring differences in intelligence vs. parent-offspring differences in educational and occupational attainment.

This is a replication of theanalyses done by Waller (1971) andMascie-Taylorand Gibson (1978), using father-son pairs, which found significant positive correlations between father-son differences in IQ scores and father-son differences in occupational attainment. Midparentoffspring differences in first principal component scores, years of education, and NORC code were computed forthe present sample andcorrelated with each other separately for AEA and AJA males and females. The correlation be-

tween midparent-offspring first principal component differences and midparent-offspring educational attainment differences was found tobe0.30(p < 0.05) for AEA males, 0.07 (n.s.) for AEA females, 0.60(p< 0.001) for AJA males, and 0.33 (p < 0.05) for AJAfemales.

The second test involved obtaining difference scores for first principal component scores, years of education, and NORC code within brother-brother, sister-sister, and brother-sister pairs, using the small subset of families where data was available on more than one offspring. For these analyses education and

NORC were also age-corrected using regression procedures. Table 8 presents the results of correlating within-pair differences in ability with within-pair differences in attainment separately for brother-brother, sister-sister, and brother-sister pairs. Consistent with the above results, within-pair differences in ability were strongly related to withinpair differences in attainment for males

DISCUSSION
In contrast to the results of the studies cited in the Introduction, analysesof both HFSC parent and offspring attainment indicate that family background generally had a relatively small influence on attainment, whereas own cognitive ability (particularly verbal ability and general intelligence) had a substantial influence over andabove the influence of family background for all groups of males and for AJA mothers. Family background did have a far greater influence relative to own abilities on the attainment of AEA mothers and both AEA and AJA female offspring. The families recruited for the HFSC were of somewhat higher mean

socioeconomic status than the population average, although a wide range of statuses was represented, so restriction of range could account for some of the lack of a stronger influence of family background on attainment. Also of note is that the relative influence of family background vs. own ability on attainment was generally consistent across generations, in spite of the age difference between the parent and offspring samples. This may be cautiously interpreted asindicating that degree of social mobility through ability, as well as the sex difference in degree of mobilitydiscussed below, hasnotchanged in American society over the past twenty or so years. Parental cognitive ability and personality were found to have some if inconsistent effects on offspring attainment and are probably important factors to consider in defining those aspects of family background that dohave an influence on attainment.
As was the case with the Johnson et al. (1983) report on HFSC parent attainment, own personality, particularly the ACL factors Ego Organization (ego strength) and Intraception (independence), had inconsistent but at times substantial influence on offspring attainment. There is clearly a need, however, to use more refined personality measures to get at those aspects of personality most relevant to educational and occupational attainment, e.g., Machiavellianism (Turner andMartinez, 1977).
Cross-generational comparisons of the multiple regression results indicate that differences in theparent generation between the AEA and AJA ethnic groups in therelative influence of family background vs. own ability on attainment have largely disappeared in the offspring generation. It could be argued that the greater social mobility available

Vol. 33, No. 1-2

to the AJA parents as compared to the AEA parents was sufficient to overcome the restrictions, which seemed to be present for AEA female parents, on the attainment of women through merit. These restrictions, whether the result of sex discrimination and/or societal expectations regarding marriage and family, are apparently still present in American society, as the results on the attainment of both AEA and AJA female offspring indicate.
Finally, it should again be noted that most of the variance in attainment was not accounted for by the variables used in any of our analyses. While some of this is undoubtedly due to unreliability

of the measures, as was also stated in Johnson et al. (1983), "chance" may in fact play a large role in educational and occupational attainment.
