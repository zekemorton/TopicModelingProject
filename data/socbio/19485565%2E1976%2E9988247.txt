ABSTRACT: The conceptual model presented allows for the identification and organization of different kinds of fertility policies and programs, as they affect fertility, and the relevant elements of the sociocultural variables, dichotomized into "structural" and "cultural" components, that can be associated with fertility. Support for the model was obtained by "fitting" Puerto Rican fertility policies and programs, and structural and cultural components, to the model. Seventeen regression equations using polynomials to the third degree are used for the statistical interpretation of the Puerto Rican data. The results indicate that the use and interpretation of the model and some of the polynomial regression analyses are successful.

The important question "What are the ments of the sociocultural variables that

factors affecting fertility?" has been tack- can be associated with fertility. The rela-

rarely been attempted. As a result, and also because of insufficient sociological research, two problems arise.
One is a lack of knowledge concerning the effect that different kinds of fertility policies and programs have on fertility. The second is that little has been done to determine the sociocultural factors amenable to government intervention through which change in fertility can occur. The importance of identifying such variables becomes clearer when one considers that governments have long been enacting fertility programs without adequate benefit of a sociological perspective.
These two problems have prompted the author to develop a conceptual model that can identify different kinds of fertility policies and programs as they affect fertility and also identifies the relevant ele-

The model that is briefly presented seems relatively comprehensive and suited to empirical analysis. It can be used to uncover the effect fertility policies and programs have on fertility.
If the structural and cultural elements of the model can be identified in a country, and a change in them can be attributed to specific fertility policies and programs, then such a change can be identified and measured. This is the general proposition that represents this exploratory study's methodological approach.
A test of the model can be accomplished by "fitting" a country to the model. This involves three steps. First, the relevant literature is reviewed and fertility policies and programs and sociocultural elements are identified. An interpretation is then made of the influence of fertility policies

and programs on the sociocultural variables, and the sociocultural variables on fertility. The number and types of sociocultural variables used may differ, depending upon the country.
The second step involves the statistical analysis. Because the interest in these data lies in their trend over a specified period of time, a type of trend analysis using polynomial regression is used to "test" the trend of birth or fertility rates.
The third step integrates the conclusions of an extensive literature review and the statistical analysis.
DEVELOPMENT OF THE MODEL
FERTILITY POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
Fertility is being increasingly identified as one of the most important problematic factors in population growth. Drawing from discussions on population policy by Eldridge (1968, p. 381; 1954, p. 5), Lorimer (1969), Nortman (1964), National Academy of Sciences (1971), and Taylor (1968), we may define a fertility policy as the method or course of action that has been adopted by a government and is designed to influence and to determine decisions regarding the fertility of a country. There are two kinds of fertility policies, explicit and implicit.
An explicit fertility policy is one that is expressed by the government as a fertility policy. An explicit fertility policy is either "restrictive," i.e., designed to provide principles for limiting further growth or change (Spengler and Duncan, 1956, p. 441) or "expansionist," i.e., advocating an increase in population or the rate of growth (Cook, 1951; Glass, 1936; and Wright, 1939).
The procedural action of the fertility policy is the fertility program. It is an organized list of procedures--a schedule arranged to produce an intended observable effect following the principles set forth by

the fertility policy (Eldridge, 1954; Kirk, 1970, p. 87). Fertility programs are either "responsive" to population change, i.e., "they are enacted to ameliorate or overcome the effects of rapid population growth" (American Universities Field Staff, 1972, p. 289) (emphasis mine), or they are "influencing" population change (American Universities Field Staff, 1972, p. 289; National Academy of Sciences, 1971, pp. 70-72, 77-95), i.e., pro-natalist or anti-natalist (Thomlinson, 1965; Peterson, 1969). While fertility programs are enacted under guidance of a policy perspective and are designed with "intended" structural and cultural effects, they may, in fact, have "unintended" effects.
At the same level as explicit fertility policies are implicit policies. Implicit fertility policies do not reflect the avowed purposes of the government and are not expressed as fertility policies.
The last variable, time, is perhaps the one important variable which can be used to measure change in fertility. Time is divided into "short-term" and "long-term" effects (Spengler, 1955). This distinction is important because the greater the period of time, the greater the possibility that other fertility and nonfertility programs will intervene and confound the effects of the fertility programs being studied.
SOCIOCULTURAL VARIABLES:
STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS
Structural components refer to the characteristics of patterned social order (Olsen, 1968, pp. 44-50). The first three structural factors are discussed in depth by Davis and Blake (1956). They include factors affecting exposure to intercourse, exposure to conception, and gestation and successful parturition. An up-date and general expansion to include more fully the industrialized countries can be found in Davis (1967), Deyrup (1962), Gold-

scheider (1971), Hartley (1972), Pendleton (1974a), and Thomlinson (1965).
The fourth variable affecting fertility is the social organization of the society; the coordination of social relationships among individuals and groups. The patterned regularities of behavior that represent stable organization promote conformity to traditional practices which may be supporting a high or low fertility rate. Degrees of disorganization, usually stimulated by very rapid social change, may affect fertility by reducing conformity to traditional fertility behavior or by contributing to the spread of sterility-inducing diseases, pestilence, famine, and sacrifice (Freedman, 1961, pp. 64, 66; Lorimer, 1969, pp. 248, 251; Peterson, 1969, pp. 391-392).
The fifth variable is education and socialization. Education involves the systematic transfer of skills or specific knowledge (Davis, 1949, pp. 218-220). In reference to fertility, education can be divided into two types of influence (Nam, 1968, p. 515). The first is education's influence on the standard and style of living. Most prominent here is the inverse relationship between education (or social class) and fertility (American Universities Field Staff, 1972, p. 20; Banks, 1968, p. 515; Beshers, 1967, pp. 499-500; Bogue, 1969, pp. 676-677; Liu, 1970, pp. 473-484; National Academy of Sciences, 1971, pp. 53-54; Peterson, 1969, pp. 117, 501-503; and Thomlinson, 1965, pp. 180-183). The second influence of education involves the dissemination of available contraceptive knowledge. Education provides the individual with knowledge needed to regulate fertility behavior (Nam, 1968, p. 515; also see the Commission on Population Growth and the American Future, 1972, pp. 123-- 124).
The sixth and last variable, health and welfare, is divided into physical health, mental health, and welfare. An increase in physical health for any country can "in-

crease fertility rates, partly by permitting more people to survive to the reproductive ages and partly by reducing diseases and physical disabilities that cause sterility" (Ford and Dejong, 1970, p. 400; also see Corsa and Oakley, 1971; Hartley, 1972, pp. 214-215; National Academy of Sciences, 1971, p. 3; and Peterson, 1969, p. 230). The influence of mental health on fertility deals with a greater sense of group belongingness, fulfillment of various psychic rewards, and greater employment opportunities (for women) resulting in women wanting smaller families (Population Reference Bureau, 1970, p. 26). The impact of welfare on fertility is very unclear. Inducements (e.g., monetary rewards) to limit or increase fertility have been used, but the actual effect seems to be minimal or linked to other variables in a complex fashion (Carr-Saunders, 1968, pp. 143-153; Ford and Dejong, 1970, pp. 400, 402; Pendleton, 19746; Schorr, 1970, pp. 441-453).
SOCIOCULTURAL VARIABLES:
CULTURAL COMPONENTS
Cultural factors consist of "all shared beliefs and knowledge, the norms or expectations" of behavior "and the. values or ideas of what is most desirable, as well as the evaluations of actual behavior in light of the shared beliefs, expectations and values" (Hartley, 1972, p. 198). Three components of culture are distinguished for the purposes of this paper: knowledge and beliefs, values, and norms and mores.
The knowledge and beliefs of a society are similar and tend to be distinguished as a matter of degree. Beliefs are a matter of faith and emotion as opposed to the scientific "truth" or "reality" of knowledge, but both are regarded as real and true. Beliefs or knowledge about male virility, biblical requirements for progeny (Davis, 1949, pp. 561-562), being a "complete" woman (Thomlinson, 1965, pp. 155-156), con-

ception, contraception, or the advantages of raising small or large families (Bogue, 1969, p. 678; Hartley, 1972, pp. 46-48) all serve to influence fertility.
Values are often regarded as cherished ideas or ideals. They carry with them the emotionally charged feeling of right and wrong and tend to determine what is considered desirable, worthwhile, and important; they can also explain and justify behavior. Values, as they are related to fertility, can be tangible, i.e., monetary and nonmonetary (Meadows, 1956, p. 441; Hartley, 1972, p. 257), or intangible. Intangible values include immaterial assets (Hartley, 1972, p. 257), spiritual inducements to enter marriage and produce children (Thomlinson, 1965, p. 560), perpetuation of the family lines (Lorimer, 1969, p. 247), sex preference of offspring (Population Reference Bureau, 1970, p. 25), and the development of attitudes toward pregnancy and parenthood (Davis, 1967, p. 737; Lorimer, 1969, pp. 249-250).
The third cultural component includes norms and mores. Norms define the legitimate objectives worth striving for (Merton, 1949, p. 126), while mores are obligatory norms supported by core values of the culture. In a demographic sense, social norms and mores are those dealing primarily with reproductive processes, or those regarded as "normal" in relation to marriage and reproduction. Examples include the interpersonal communication involved in family planning decisions (Freedman, 1961; Stycos, 1968a, p. 438) and sanctions employed to promote certain kinds of fertility behavior (Davis, 1949, pp. 557-561; 1963, pp. 362-365).
APPLICATION OF THE MODEL: THE CASE OF PUERTO RICO
The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico was chosen as an empirical example to fit the model because of three factors: (a) as a

Commonwealth of the United States since 1952, and before that a Territory, it is assumed that special attention was given to the collection and reporting of demographic data; (b) "no soundings of public or private opinion prior to the 1960's with respect to family planning were taken in Latin America, other than in Puerto Rico" (Stycos, 1971, p. 76); and (c) a preliminary review of the literature showed a fairly large body of social demographic information available for Puerto Rico.
FERTILITY POLICIES AND PROGRAMS
Puerto Rico made what are possibly the earliest attempts of fertility control among Latin American nations (Nortman, 1964, p. 18). Since the early 1930's, Puerto Rico has officially had a policy of "restriction" with respect to population growth. While this policy has been somewhat overshadowed by religious pressure and World War II, it has manifested itself with both fertility programs and a slow but constant change of attitude toward acceptance of birth control by the population.
For Puerto Rico, programs reported most often and in the greatest detail are the family planning programs. These programs, since 1940, are listed below in chronological order.
In 1946, a voluntary organization called the Association of Population Studies was formed for the purposes of contraceptive education and dissemination, research, and financial aid for sterilization and fertility services (Curt, 1966, p. 230). Funding for the Association initially came from the Planned Parenthood Association of America. Soon afterwards, other private sources began granting money to the Association because funds could not be obtained from the Puerto Rican government (Back et al., I960, p. 565; United Nations, 1972, pp. 69-70).
In 1959 the name was changed to the Family Planning Association. This new

Association "started a unique campaign of utilizing lay voluntary leaders to distribute a vaginal contraceptive cream on an island-wide basis" (Curt, 1966, p. 231). But because of the lack of funding, the programs supported by the Family Planning Association had all but disappeared by 1965 (Kelly, 1972, pp. 49-50).
Then, in mid-1964, the University of Puerto Rico's Medical School began a program for an area that included San Juan, Puerto Rico's largest city. The program was most active between 1964 and 1968 (Torres, 1969, p. 115).
In 1966, the United States Office of Economic Opportunity gave a sizable grant to the almost defunct Family Planning Association of Puerto Rico (Torres, 1969, pp. 121-122; Kelly, 1972, p. 50).
Since 1967, the Puerto Rican government has reportedly taken steps to support more actively the organizations already in existence and to support research and educational activities directed toward fertility control (Torres, 1969, pp. 118-121).
SOCIOCULTURAL VARIABLES
A general survey of the relevant literature on Puerto Rico produced sociocultural information that was classified according to the listing of the sociocultural variables presented earlier (Pendleton, 1974a). The eight variables discussed below were determined as influencing fertility.
Age at first marriage is extremely low. During the early 195O's, about 50 per cent of women were married by the time they were 16 years of age, and by age 21, nearly 90 per cent of women were married. Information from the United Nations (summarized by Pendleton, 1974a) indicates that there was also a fairly low age of entry into a consensual union and that this low age of entry continued into the late 196O's.
Theoretically, a low age of entry into a sexual union does not necessarily mean a

low age for first birth. However, the United Nation's data for Puerto Rico show that between 1949 and 1966, 70 to 80 per cent of all first births occurred to women under 24 years of age (Pendleton, 1974a, p. 73). Women under the age of 19 alone accounted for 40 per cent of the total first births. Thus, there has been a consistently low age both for entry into a sexual union and for first birth.
Puerto Rico was small enough for mass emigration1 to act as an effective safety valve in halting what would have been extremely rapid population growth (Thomlinson, 1965, p. 342). Occurring between 1946 and 1959, the mass emigration largely involved the age group 15-44 years old (Friedlander, 1965). What effect emigration had on lowering fertility is discussed later.
On the surface, figures for sterilization (voluntary infecundity) are impressive. Approximately 17 per cent of the female population was sterilized in the early 195O's (Back et al., 1960, p. 572), and by 1965 this figure had increased to about 34 per cent (United Nations, 1972, p. 100). But the majority of the women were sterilized after their fourth pregnancy, and because of the popularity of the operation, many women were motivated to have their children earlier (Hill et al., 1969, pp. 176-177; Hatt, 1952, p. 447). The latter influence would tend to support an increase in fertility.
Before the introduction of the "pill" and the IUD, birth control use was irregular and probably had little influence. The IUD, and the pill as well, seemed to have the "once and for all" appeal that made sterilization so popular. The effect of the contemporary methods is unclear, although by 1965 50 per cent of the females
1 Mass emigration is classified as involuntary abstinence because of the separation of a couple when one spouse leaves Puerto Rico to find a new or better job and to establish a financial base before sending for the remaining spouse.

of reproductive age were estimated to be using birth control, of which 28 per cent were using the pill or IUD (Vazquez, 1968; Satterthwaite, 1966).
Overt religious disapproval of birth control did little to halt its use. What effect the anti-birth-control campaign had was reflected in the government, which ended up adopting a fairly neutral public position in the birth control debate (Back et al., 1969, p. S68). Church denunciation did have some apparent pro-birth-control impact. The publicity intended to be against contraception actually served to disseminate information about contraceptives all over the island, which actually may have served to promote their use (see Stycos, 19686, pp. 98-115).
A lack of communication between spouses has served to impede the progress of birth control use (Stycos, 1962, pp. 311-312; Hill et al., 1959, pp. 147-162). Without communication between partners in the area of sex and birth control, the success of a birth control program diminishes (Stycos, 19686, pp. 140-141).
Education has served as a building block for furthering the spread of birth control knowledge and decreasing the traditional attitude of viewing children as economic benefits. The more educated, especially the rural educated, used birth control more often and knew where to go for contraceptive services and information (Back et al., 1960).
Health conditions have improved correspondingly with a decrease in infant and maternal mortality rates. The result is not only longer life expectancy but an increase in potential reproduction (Curt, 1966, p. 229, Vazquez, 1968, p. 862).
While knowledge of birth control is very high, many women do not obtain this knowledge until after their third child. The remaining women also run into problems with irregular use of birth control and lack of communication with their

spouses (Hill et al., 1959; Back et al., I960).2
METHODOLOGY
Trend analysis using polynomial regression is used for the data analysis covering several periods of time. The crude birth rate and fertility rate are used as dependent variables representing "fertility." Emigration is included because of its reported importance in affecting Puerto Rico's fertility.
Polynomial regression uses regression equations of varying degrees to fit the data (Draper and Smith, 1966; Winer, 1962, pp. 70-71, 218-220). If the trend of the data is a straight line, a linear equation is used to provide the best explanation. A second degree (quadratic) equation, or that which determines the data as having either a change from an upward to downward movement or the reverse, may provide a better explanation than the linear trend. A third degree equation, using the cube of the predictor variable found in the linear and second degree equations, may provide still another, possibly better, explanation for the trend of the data. The third degree equation describes two changes in the direction of the data (Cooley and Lohnes, 1971, pp. 76-95; Kelly and Beggs, 1969; Ward and Jennings, 1973; Williams, 1974, pp. 124-143).
The format of the analysis of variance table which is used for each set of regression equations is presented in Cooley and Lohnes (1971, p. 80). The sum of squares is represented as the multiple correlation squared (i?2), indicating the overall effectiveness of the multiple regression.
An initial F value is calculated for all

However, while other socioeconomic indicators may be important, we remain with the socially oriented variables in this study.

A second F value is calculated for the reduction (of the residual) due to the addition of either the quadratic or cubic trend. This F value indicates if the addition of the quadratic equation significantly increases the amount of variance explained beyond that for the linear trend, and if the addition of the cubic equation significantly increases the amount of variance explained beyond that for the quadratic

The first set of regression equations, covering the years 1947 to 1962, attempts to identify the influence of Puerto Rico's out-migration on fertility. We are now able to "test" the opinion of some authors that emigration was a primary reason for the decline in Puerto Rico's fertility rate. Our measure of fertility excludes the very young and very old, but includes males ages 15 to 44 who, because of possible sex selection in emigration, could contribute to fertility changes.

The important figure is the 1.9 per cent variance accounted for by emigration after the linear trend. This interpretation of the effect of emigration on fertility is in conflict with the explanations given by Friedlander (196S), and Hill et al., (1959, pp. 14-15) and implied by Thomlinson (1965, p. 494).

equations to the amount of variance explained is not significant. Following the rule of parsimony, the linear equation is most important. The significant F of 19.8 indicates that the monotonic equation best explains the trend of the birth rate. But notice that only 47.4 per cent of the variance in the birth rate is accounted for. This figure is the lowest/?2 encountered yet. Almost 53 per cent of the variance is unaccounted for, strongly indicating that any sharp variations in the fertility rate may be due to the influence of fertility programs.
After 1947 both the birth and fertility rates begin very sharp declines. The fertility rate drops sharply between 1947 and 1954 with the exception of 1949 to 1950. This sharp decrease begins about a year after the Association of Population Studies began its operations. The birth rate increases slightly between 1943 and 1947, due to the ending of World War II and the returning servicemen.
There was an extremely low age of entry into a sexual union and age at first birth. The reported popularity of sterilization may have acted as an important variable with the low age of entry and first birth. If looking ahead to sterilization did motivate women to complete their families at an earlier age, this motivation may be reflected by the early ages at first birth. Lack of communication between partners and the increasing health of the population would serve to promote an increase in fertility rather than the observed decrease. A knowledge of birth control, and that it could be used to limit unwanted births in the future, would also be a slight stimulant for fertility.
Operating against those factors promoting an increase in fertility were increasing education, the unwitting advertising of birth control by the church, and the use of contraceptives. Many Puerto Ricans had already heard of contraceptives (since the

late 1930's), and the illiterate population had been rapidly decreasing. There was also an increased availability of contraceptives, presumably encouraging greater use. Although the Association of Population Studies may have been the primary agent for the fantastic decrease in fertility, there is a great probability that the fertility rate would have decreased anyway. The stage was set, or had been in the making, for a number of years before 1947. The Association simply acted as a "trigger" for the decrease.
Between 1954 and 1956, the fertility rate rose sharply. It is possible that the drastic reduction in emigration between 1953 and 1954 could explain some proportion of the increase. It also may be part of the "baby boom." Adding to this increase would be the decreasing influence of the Association of Population Studies, which by the middle 1950's had begun to stagnate. The fertility rate then decreased between 1956 and 1960 which may have been a continuation of the decline given impetus in the late 1940's and early 1950's.
The fertility rate declined very quickly after 1960, from 80 to 59. In 1959, the Association of Population Studies was given new life through sizable monetary grants and new organization. Then called the Family Planning Association of Puerto Rico, it started campaigns that apparently were more effective than those before. The majority of the fertility rate decline between 1960 and 1963 must be attributed to the Family Planning Association of Puerto Rico. After about 1962, the Association began to become ineffective. A slowing of the fertility rate decline between 1963 and 1965 reflects this. The age of first entry into a sexual union and first birth were still low in the 1960's, and sterilization had risen to 34 per cent by 1965. But, the introduction of the pill, and the dissatisfaction of the church, unintendingly popularizing birth control, served to pro-

vide the influence needed to further lower the fertility rate. With the increased level of education, the lack of communication between spouses and late accumulation of birth control knowledge may have decreased in importance as stimulants for fertility. The new program begun by the University of Puerto Rico's Medical School (in 1964) in the Commonwealth's most populated area, the northeast region, seemed to revive a decrease in the fertility rate after 1965. The Family Planning Association of Puerto Rico was given sizable amounts of money in 1966. The effect, along with the university's program, was to continue the rate of decrease at a slightly faster pace than before.
Generally, the Association of Population Studies, the earliest organization, had the most questionable impact upon fertility. But when included with the other three programs over the 24 years, the total effect of all four programs appears to be quite important in explaining the fertility rate decreases.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
With the first two sets of regression equations, we find that the effects of emigration between 1940 and 1962 are minimal. The computed percentages of the total variance accounted for by emigration was found to be quite small; and, after the effect of emigration was partialed out of both the fertility and birth rate, there were still significant variations from the expected trends.
There are a number of possible explanations for the lack of influence by emigration. First, a majority of the emigrants may have been past their reproductive ages or males aged 15-44. The effect on Puerto Rican fertility would be minimal if the males who left did not significantly reduce the number of males who could be regarded as eligible mates. This explana-

tion may by supported by Vazquez (1968, p. 858) who reports that in 1950 the proportion of women 15 to 44 years of age to the total female population was 43 per cent. This percentage declined to 40 per cent in 1960 due to the age selectivity of emigration. By 1967, this percentage was up to 43 per cent again. This 3 per cent variation does not seem to be enough to affect fertility.
A second explanation is that emigration did significantly affect fertility, but the effect was not to reduce fertility but rather to keep it from increasing. If, after 1947, the Puerto Rican fertility rate was destined to increase, then emigration may have played an important role in containing that increase.
The third explanation for a lack of influence by emigration is given by Stycos (19686) when he says that "women migrants have consistently lower fertility than non-migrants, even when residence, age, marital status, education and employment status are controlled" (p. 282).
The third set of regression equations were used for the years 1947 to 1970, without regard to emigration. This analysis showed that there were very significant variations from both the linear and quadratic trends. The first program, in 1946, contributed to a sharp decline in both the fertility rate and the birth rate. It acted as a "trigger," but was not the underlying cause of the fertility decrease after 1947. The other three programs, begun in 1959, 1964, and 1966, served to lower the fertility faster than before. Their effect is not as unclear as that of the 1946 program.
The interpretation of which structural and cultural components played a more important role is difficult. The low age at first entry into a sexual union and first birth is the one confounding factor. Both ages have remained extremely low since 1949, definitely providing a stimulus for
