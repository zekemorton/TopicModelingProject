ABSTRACT: Two samples of unplanned and planned children, matched for education, were compared for emotional disturbance on three different instruments. Unplanned children scored consistently higher, in some cases significantly so, particularly among the lower classes. In the second sample, mothers were also compared for neuroticism and for parental attitudes. Mothers of unplanned children scored higher, but not significantly so. No differences in maternal attitudes of rejection and protection were found. In the second study, unplanned children came from significantly larger families than did planned children. It is postulated that the greater the adversity of circumstance of the family, the more negative the effects of unplanned status will be on emotional adjustment.

The arrival of an unwanted child may create serious psychological consequences for all concerned. Redman and Lieberman (1973) have asserted that "unwanted pregnancy at any age is inimical to physical, mental and social well-being for parents and children."
Although a number of authors have argued that unwanted children suffer adverse psychological consequences (e.g., Blau, 1964; Soddy, 1964), much of this discussion has been speculative. Proper empirical studies are either absent or methodologically poor. After a thorough review of the literature, Pohlman (1969) discovered little evidence to support the notion that unwanted conceptions have undesirable effects, but he pointed out that "on the whole, this is a matter of lack of research and a lack of either positive or negative findings rather than an accumulation of negative results" (p. 329). On a more theoretical level, similar views were expressed by David (1971).
After examining 120 Swedes at the age of 21, who were born after their mothers had been refused abortions, Forssman and

Thuwe (1966) concluded that they were "worse off in every respect" compared to a control series of wanted children. This study, however, represents an extreme case.
Our aim is to investigate the emotional adjustment of unplanned versus planned children and that of their mothers. The psychological well-being of the mother is extremely important in this respect because of the close emotional interaction between mother and child. Furthermore, the mother's psychological state might be a factor in her having had unplanned children. It could in addition be argued that mothers might be less accepting of unplanned children. We also wish to determine whether there are differences in the family size of planned and unplanned children.
Our hypotheses are: (1) Unplanned children will be significantly more emotionally disturbed than planned children. (2) The mothers of unplanned children will be significantly more neurotic and rejecting than the mothers of planned children. (3) Unplanned children will belong to sig-

nificantly larger families than will planned children.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Two separate studies were carried out. The first investigated only the childrens' emotional adjustment, whereas the second also looked at the mothers' personalities and the family size. The first study was done earlier, and no questions were asked about family size or about neuroticism or attitudes among mothers.
SAMPLES
The first sample consisted of 58 planned and 39 unplanned white children who were ten- and eleven-year-old Std. 3 pupils (fifth year at school) in four schools. Fifty-three children were from three private schools, catering to a middle class population, while 44 were from a government school serving a low social class area.
In the middle class, there were 36 planned and 17 unplanned children; and in the lower class, 22 planned and 22 unplanned children.
The second sample consisted of 53 planned and 35 unplanned children who were living with both natural parents at the time of the study. The children were all Std. 6 pupils (eighth year at school) at two coeducational Cape Town schools. The mean ages of the two groups of children were 13.45 and 13.27 years. The social class scale of the University of Cape Town Child Guidance Clinic was used. "Middle class" subjects refer to those children represented by Categories II and HI on the social class scale given below; "lower class" subjects, to children represented by Categories IV and V. Social classes I and VI were unrepresented. In the middle class, there were 43 planned and 17 unplanned children; and in the lower class, 10 planned and 18 unplanned children.

The social class of the children was determined by father's occupation as follows: Class II, professionals, salaried executives, businessmen; Class HI small businessmen, small farmers, clerical workers, white-collar workers, semiprofessionals; Class IV, skilled workers, qualified tradesmen, apprentices; Class V, semi-skilled workers.
ASSESSMENT TOOLS
The neuroticism scale of the Junior Eysenck Personality Inventory (J.E.P.I.) and the Rutter Parents' and Teachers' Questionnaires (scales A2 and B2 respectively) were used to assess the emotional adjustment of the children.
Split-half reliabilities for the J.E.P.I., which average between 0.7 and 0.8, as well as satisfactory test-retest reliabilities have been obtained for all age groups on all three scales of the Inventory (Eysenck, 1965). While little is known about the validity of the J.E.P.I., Eysenck (1965) has reported the use of the Inventory with 229 English child guidance clinic subjects who, as a group, have been found to be significantly above the standardized sample with respect to neuroticism.
The Rutter Parents' Questionnaire was devised to fill a need for a reliable and valid test suitable for use with children in the middle age range and capable of identifying emotionally disturbed children (Rutter et al., 1972). While satisfactory retest and inter-rater reliability coefficients have been obtained for the older forms of the Parents' and Teachers' Questionnaires, these are still unavailable for the latest improved versions of the tests, but would be expected to be at least as good.
Since school teachers have the opportunity both to observe and to compare large groups of children, and because of the practical significance of the child's behavior at school, the Rutter Teachers' Questionnaire was also used.
