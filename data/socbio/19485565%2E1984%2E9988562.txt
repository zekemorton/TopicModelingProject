ABSTRACT:This paper studies the relationship between three aspects of female status (education, work experience, and age at marriage) and the use of contraception and fertility in Bangladesh. Education is found to be the variable most strongly correlated with use of contraception and is also one of the significant variables explaining fertility behavior. The most important factor explaining fertility behavior is age at marriage. The higher the age at marriage, the lower the fertility, when all other factors are held constant. Work experience has very little or no effect on current use of contraception and fertility.

The purpose of this paper has been to data collected by the Bangladesh Fertil-

study the nature of the relation between ity Survey (BFS) of 1975.

lations may have for future fertility reduction in a developing country like Bangladesh. Relationships among these variables have been well explored in the developed countries, but in Bangladesh almost nothing is known about this topic. In this study a modest attempt is made to fill this gap. It has been hypothesized that female education, work experience, and age at marriage will be positively associated with use of contraception and negatively with fertility. These relationships are examined separately for rural and urban areas, using

Education has consistently been shown to be inversely related to fertility, and it is often said that higher education leads to greater use of contraception and, consequently, to lower fertility (Coale, 1965; Berelson, 1976). Education is a very complex variable. It is being used as a proxy measure of the opportunity cost of housewife's time (Mincer, 1963), a measure of the formation of taste and preferences (Easterlin, 1969) or one's socioeconomic status (Leibenstein, 1974), and also as a proxy measure of modernization (Inkeles,

1974). Leaving aside these complexities,

cial mobility, and higher nonfamilial aspirations but also a new outlook, freedom from tradition, willingness to analyze institutions, values and patterns of behavior, and growth of rationalism. It may also reduce desired family size by raising desired living standards and provides a greater range of general information, better understanding of the reproductive process, and access to modern and effective means of birth control. Moreover, it is expected that an educated mother will take better pre- and post-natal care, and this will increase the chances of survival of infants. Higher chances of survival of infants may lead to reduction in desired family size.1 Thus, education is likely to be positively associated with use of contraception and negatively with fertility.
Greater female participation in the labor force has often been suggested asa means of reducing fertility. This suggestion is based on the assumption that employment outside the home provides alternative satisfactions for women which may compete with her raising children (Berelson, 1969; Blake, 1965; Collver, 1966; Collver, 1962; Jaffe, 1959; Kasarda, 1971; Kirk, 1965).If work outside the home competes with child rearing, working women would be expected to practice contraception more frequently and to have fewer children than nonworking women. Moreover, married women who wish to continue working outside the home must practice contraception more effectively.
The current theory regarding female labor force participation and fertility postulates that female labor force par-

ticipation will not result in lower fertility perse unless there is greater incompatibility between the roles of mother and worker (United Nations, 1975). If the degree of role incompatibility is the pivotal factor in determining the differences in fertility levels between working and nonworking women, such differentials among rural women should be smaller than among urban women. In rural areas, women are mainly engaged in farm work which does not necessarily take a married woman far from her home. Moreover, in rural areas, mother-substitutes who can help look after children and other domestic chores are more likely to be available. Conversely, work in the modernized sector of the economy in urban areas means separation of work from home, and substitute parents are rare. Role conflict is thus more likely among women working in urban areas, particularly in big industrial centers and metropolitan areas. However, it is not clear whether women have fewer children because they work, or work because they have fewer children. Moreover, it has been argued that it is not labor force participation per se which affects fertility but a series of other variables associated with labor force participation, such as age at marriage, longer period of schooling, etc. Lower fertility among working women is also sometimes attributed to subfecundity which is usually found to be higher among working women (Freedman et al., 1959). Some of these problems are overcome here by confining the study to fecund married women for rural and urban areas separately and by introducing more control variables while examining the net effect of female participation in the labor force on the practice of contraception and fertility behavior.

Age at marriage is considered to be one of the most important variables affecting fertility behavior, particularly in a noncontraceptive society. Marriage is an event that marks the beginning of the period of potential childbearing. Late age at marriage may affect cumulative marital fertility by shortening the duration of marriage within the reproductive span. Moreover, delayed marriage may be considered as a deliberate attempt on the part of a woman to restrict her fertility, among other reasons. Therefore, she is likely to practice contraception more effectively. However, later age at marriage may not lead to lower completed family size if women desire a large family, and women married at the higher ages try to compensate for their lost reproductive years through producing more children at older ages by short spacing. But this is not likely to happen. Rele (1962) observed that the effort to recover the losses in reproduction on the part of the persons married at older ages was not sufficient to recoup the losses caused by the foregone early reproductive period.
It should be noted here that delayed age at marriage is not a necessary condition for limiting family size. One may be married at an early age and still have fewer children by practicing contraception more effectively. Moreover, age at marriage may not have any significant bearing on fertility in societies like those of the Caribbean where there is vast acceptance for children being born outside legal wedlock. Therefore, the negative association between age at marriage and family size is likely to be more pronounced in a situation where very little effort is being made to control fertility within marriage and children are born within legally constituted wedlock. Bangladesh is a noncontraceptive soci-

ety2, and almost all children are born within legal marriage. We would, therefore, expect to find age at marriage is positively associated with use of contraception and negatively with fertility.
In this paper, we shall try to determine the independent effects of these three variables on fertility and use of contraception for rural and urban areas separately. The reasons for looking at the above relationships for rural and urban areas separately are to bring homogeneity to the study and to avoid the confounding effects of residence on tastes or lifestyles. Moreover, critical examination of the work-fertility hypothesis requires its testing in an urban setting where role incompatibility between mother and worker is likely to be more acutely felt.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data employed in this study are from the Bangladesh Fertility Survey (BFS) of 1975. The BFS was based on a national probability sample of evermarried women under the age of 50 years. The data were collected by a house-to-house survey using a structured interview schedule. The survey yielded 6,515 completed interviews with eligible respondents. Of these women, 5,025 were from rural and 1,490 were from urban areas. A three-stage sample design was adopted for the rural and urban strata. The first two stages were area selections and the ultimate stage was household selection. In the first two
2According to latest available data, only 9.6 per cent of currently married women who are at risk of pregnancy were practicing contraception in 1975 (See Government of People's Republic of Bangladesh. Ministry of Health and Population Control, 1975 Bangladesh Fertility Survey Report, Dacca, 1978).

stages the selection wasdone with probability proportional to size, and in the last stage selection was done with probability inversely proportional to the number of households. This made thesample theoretically self-weighting within each stratum, urban and rural. Weighting isnecessary only for the nationaland regional estimates (see for details, 7975 Bangladesh Fertility Survey Report).
THE STUDY POPULATION
The present study is limited to "women who were married only once, currently living with their husbands and reported to be fecund"3 which is asubsample of the Bangladesh Fertility Survey (BFS). Although, 4,794 such women (3,677 rural and 1,117 urban) form the core group4 for analysis in the present study, the actual analysis will be based on a number fewer than these cases because of nonresponse to oneor more pertinent interview questions used in this study. Thecore group for analysis constitutes 74 per cent of the total sample and73percent and75per cent ofrural and urban samples and also accounts for 94per cent of those women who are married only once and currently living with their husbands.
There are specific reasons for confining the study to only "once married,
3Fecund women arethose who said "No"when asked, "Do you think you or your husband have any physical difficulty so that you may not have a child?" This measure of fecundity is based on the women's perception of fecundability and may not necessarily be indicative of the true level of infecundity in the society.
4Women whohave voluntarily sterilized themselves to restrict fertility were included in our core group for analysis. There were sixty such cases. Even when these women are excluded from the analysis, the findings reported here remains unchanged in terms of both pattern andmagnitude.

fecund women who are currently living with their husbands." These reasons are as follows: (i)fertility pattern anduse of contraception are most conveniently studied for currently married who are living with their husbands; (ii)anystudy of fertility differentials caused by social factors must be confined to fecund women.
INDEPENDENT VARIABLES
The three independent variables used in this analysis were defined asfollows:
1. Education.--Level of education was determined in terms of the highest grade passed. Thedetermining question was, "What was thehighest level of education you have passed?" It is categorized asfollows: (i)noformal education; (ii) 1-5 grade; (Hi) 6-9 grade; (iv) secondary and above.
2. Work Experience.--Working women in this study are those whohave been occupied in activity aside from doing household work for cash or kind. Nonworking women are those who never participated in gainful activities outside domestic chores. The determining questions were: (i) "Are you doing any work (for cash or kind) at the present time?" (ii)"Did you doany such work at any time before you were first married?" Answers to the above two questions are combined to determine the work status of a woman inthis study. It is categorized into (i) ever worked (i.e., worked at some point in life) and (ii)never worked.
3. Age at Marriage.--Data on each marriage was obtained by asking, "In what month and year were you married?" If the date of current marriage was not known, the age at marriagewas

sought by asking, "How old were you then?" It should be pointed out that the stated age at marriage may not necessarily coincide with the date of consummation of marriage in Bangladesh. The reported average interval between marriage contract and consummation of marriage was only 0.4 years.5 Age at marriage is classified into five categories: (i) under 15, (ii) 15-17, (in) 18-19, (iv)20-21, and (v) above 21 years.
DEPENDENT VARIABLES
Number of children ever born alive and the use of contraception are the two dependent variables used in this study. The total number of children ever born was obtained by summing the number of live births reported in the pregnancy history. Pregnancy history data were collected by a sequential approach which required detailed probing for events in each segment of a woman's reproductive life--from marriage to first live birth, first live birth to second and so on, to the last open interval. The figures on total number of children ever born are usually understated because of recall lapse. This is likely to vary with level of education, age, and other factors. We have no means of estimating the level of understatement or its differential impact. However, the sequential approach adapted here to build pregnancy history will enable women to reconstruct their pregnancy histories more accurately since it helps to minimize memory lapse and misplacement of events in the time scale of their reproductive life. Contraceptive status was measured in terms of

current use6 and ever use.7 Information on current use of contraception is reported to be somewhat underestimated in both rural and urban setting of Bangladesh (Green, 1969; Stoeckel and Moqbul, 1969). We have no means of estimating to what extent this holds true in the present survey.
RESULTS
The relationship between use of contraception and three independent variables is shown in Table 1. For the entire sample, education and age at marriage stand out as the most important factors, followed by work experience, affecting the use of contraception, whether measured by current use or ever use. The contraception increases with each increase in educational level,risingfrom 8 per cent for women with no education to 42 per cent at the highest level.
The similar pattern of positive relationship also exists between age at marriage and use of contraception. The use of contraception is at least 22percentage points higher among women who were married at the age of 22 and above compared to those who contracted their marriage at very early ages of less than 15years.
The expected negative relationship between women's work experience and use of contraception is confirmed by
6Current users are those who reported themselves as currently practicing some method of contraception and could mention the name of method now being practiced. The question asked to determine the status of current use of contraception was, "Are you or your husband currently using a method to keep you from getting pregnant? If yes, mention the method."
7Ever users include those who are currently practicing some method of contraception and also those who used some method at some previous stage of their marriage.

data. But differences in the current use of contraception between women of varying work experiences are not very large. For example, the current use of contraception is only 2 percentage points higher among ever-worked women compared to those who have never worked. However, this small vari-

group as a whole may not be true for its constituent parts. It can be seen from the data presented in Table 1 that at each level of education and age at marriage the use of contraception is higher in urban than in rural areas. Moreover, the use of contraception (measured either as current use or ever use) increases monotonically with each increase in level of education and age at marriage on one hand and use of contraception on the other in urban areas. But a similar picture is lacking in rural areas where we find women with secondary education use contraception less than do women who finished sixth to ninth grade. Similarly, the use of contraception is somewhat lower among women who are married at the highest ages (i.e., 22 years and above) compared to those who are in the immediate preceding highest age at marriage category (i.e., 20-21 years). These results may be attributed, along with others, to sample fluctuation associated with small number of cases in the highest education and age at marriage categories in rural areas.
It may be further observed from Table 1 that the distribution of cases among categories of independent variables is more spread out in urban than in rural areas. This factor of relatively wider variation of cases among levels of independent variables and also the effect of urbanization may account for the stronger relationship between the independent variables and the use of contraception in urban than in rural areas. However, this difference may also arise out of variations in the socioeconomic and demographic backgrounds of the respondents in rural and urban areas. This problem will be taken care of when we find out the net effect of an independent variable on the use of contraception within each residential group.

We have so far examined the relationship between each of the three independent variables and the use of contraception separately. In order to examine the net effect of independent variables on the use of contraception, we have used Maximum Likelihood Logit Technique because the dependent variable is dichotomous. Logit is a type of regression with a transformed dependent variable.8 Its functional form is as follows:
log, -- - po + pi-i · +
where P is the probability of contraception use (or the event occurring), (Jo to pn are the coefficients, and X\ to Xn are independent variables. Under this approach, the dependent variable for each observation in our study takes the value of one if the respondent is currently practicing contraception, while a value of 0 is assigned to those individual women who are not currently practicing contraception. The results based exclusively on binary explanatory variables are presented in Table 2. From these results, we will be able to ascertain the net effect of each of the independent variables on current use of contraception. As expected, propensity to use contraception is positively associated with level of education, work experience, and age at marriage for the entire sample. Women with the highest education (secondary and above) are more likely to use contraception than are women who have no formal education. Similarly, women with 6-9 grade and primary (1-5) level education are more

likely to use contraception than those who have no formal education. The value of the regression coefficient rises from 0.692 to 1.684 as one moves from lowest to the highest education category.
The women who have ever worked are also more likely to use contraception than those who have never worked. The probability of using contraception increases by at least 0.208 among the women who have ever worked over those who have never worked.

Women who are married at higher ages (i.e., above 15 years) are more likely to use contraception than those who married at the youngest ages (i.e., less than 15 years). The propensity to use contraception increases as the age at marriage rises. For example, the regression coefficient rises from 0.1141 to 0.7725 as one moves from the 15-17 marriage-age group to the above-22years group.
Although the signs of relationship between use of contraception and each of

the independent variables are in the expected direction, the differences in use of contraception are not all statistically significant. For example, the propensity to use contraception among women gainfully employed outside the home does not differ significantly from those who have never worked. Similarly, propensity to use contraception between women married at the lowest age (i.e., < 15 years) and all other women is not found to be statistically significant. The only significant differences in the propensity to use contraception is found between women with no formal education and all other women. The above pattern of relationship also holds for rural and urban areas with the exception that in rural areas the propensity to use contraception among women with the highest education is not significantly higher than those with no formal education. Again, this may be attributed to a very small number of cases (see Table 1) in the highest education category in rural area. The propensity to use contraception among women with primary level education (1-5 grade) is not significantly higher than that of those with no formal education in urban areas. But this is not true in rural areas. It may also be observed from Table 2 that the propensity to use contraception among women who have ever worked outside the home is not significantly higher than that of those who have never worked irrespective of residential background. Moreover, the negative relationship observed between work status and use of contraception in urban areas is contrary to our expectation. We would expect to find this relationship more positive and stronger in urban than in rural areas, given the higher incompatibility between the role of worker and mother in the former than in the latter area.

From the above findings, it clearly emerges that education is the most important variable affecting the use of contraception. Education explains about 2 per cent of the variance in use of contraception over and above that which can be explained by all other variables together for the entire sample. For rural and urban areas, these figures are 1.3 per cent and 3 per cent respectively.
We have also examined the number of children ever born in relation to education, work experience, and age at marriage. The data are presented in Table 3. The results resemble those obtained for use of contraception. Education emerges as the most important variable, followed by age at marriage and work experience. The mean number of children ever born decreases as level of education rises. For the total sample, those who have had no formal education average two more children than those who are high school graduates and above. A similar difference is observed in both rural and urban areas.
In contrast, the fertility of ever worked women is little higher than those with no work experience. The difference between women who are married at the youngest ages (i.e., < 15 years) and those at the highest ages is at least one child for each subgroup in the study population. However, if this comparison is made between the youngest (i.e., < 15 years) and those at the next to highest age-at-marriage groups (i.e., 20-21 years), the difference works out to be at least two children. In other words, the fertility of women who are married at 20-21 years is higher than that of those married at the highest ages, i.e., 22 years and above. However, these irregularities were removed when adjustment is made for the effect of other variables which are related to both

independent variables and dependent variable under study.
In order toexamine the net effect of the independent variables on the dependent variable (i.e., number of children ever born), we have used Dummy Variable Regression. Here, each dummy variable represents asingle subclass of a factor. An individual is assigned avalue of unity if she belongs to the subclass and zero if she does not. Each subclass of the variable is considered asa sepa-

rate regressor (Fieldstein, 1966). The use of dummy variable regression does not involve making any assumptions about the linearity of the effect (Suits, 1957). The relationship between the dependent variable (fertility) and the independent variables (education, work experience, age at marriage, etc.) is analyzed by ordinary least squares. The net effect of each of the independent variables is shown in Table 4. The results of this analysis somewhat alter

the earlier conclusion based on bivariate relationship that education is the most important factor affecting fertility, followed by age at marriage and work experience. We now find that the age at marriage is the most important factor explaining fertility, followed by education and work experience when adjustment is made for the effect of other variables. These results also differ from those obtained for use of contraception. With regard to use of contraception, education was found to be the single most important explaining factor.
Age at marriage explains at least 2 per cent of variance in fertility over and above that which can be explained by all other variables together for rural areas, urban areas, and for the total sample. For the sample as a whole, we find that the probability of having a child declines with the increase in the level of age at marriage. Fertility at each level of age at marriage is significantly different from fertility for women who are married at very early ages (i.e., less than 15years). The effect of age at marriage on fertility becomes apparent, even if marriage is contracted before ages 20-21 years. This pattern holds for both rural and urban areas.
For the sample as a whole we find that the probability of having children declines with increase in the level of female education particularly from 6-9 grade onward. The fertility of women with primary level education (1-15 grade) does not differ significantly from that of women with no education. However, the fertility of women with no formal education is significantly higher than that of women with 6-9 grade education and of those with secondary level and above. This pattern also holds at least for the urban area. The picture changes somewhat in rural areas where

we find that fertility declines gradually as the level of education increases from zero to below secondary level (6-9 grade) and thereafter it increases slightly. In other words, the women with secondary and higher level of education are likely to have more children than those with below secondary level education (i.e., 6-9 grade). However, the fertility at each level of education is not significantly different from fertility for women with no formal education in the rural area. This finding may arise out of very little variation among education categories in rural areas.9
The working women for the sample as a whole and for the urban area tend to have lower fertility than those who have not worked. However, this difference in fertility between working and nonworking women is not statistically significant. This pattern changes in the rural area and when the fertility of working women is slightly higher, although not significantly, than that of the nonworking women. Thismay be due to compatibility of the roles of being mother and worker in rural area.
DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSION
The purpose of this paper has been to study the relationship between certain aspects of female status (i.e., education, work experience, and age at marriage) and the use of contraception and fertility. Of the three variables studied, education is found to be the one most strongly correlated with the use of contraception. It is also one of the signi-
9More than 76 per cent of the cases are concentrated in the "no formal" education category. Those who have attained 6-9 grade and secondary and above constitute 3 per cent and less than 1per cent of the total rural sample respectively.

ficant variables explaining fertility behavior. The effect of education on the use of contraception and fertility is found within each subgroup of the study population, particularly in the urban area and for the sample as a whole. Education of girls up to grade 6-9 can go a long way toward achieving a major breakthrough in the use of contraception and in lowering fertility. However, our data do not show whether contraception and fertility among women with higher education are affected by specific knowledge, increased rationalization,

or the greater opportunities afforded by acquired skills, or whether education is merely a proxy measure of socioeconomic status.
Age at marriage is found to be the most important factor explaining fertility behavior. The higher the age at marriage, the lower the fertility, when all other factors are held constant. This depressing effect of age at marriage on fertility holds for every subgroup of the study population. Raising age at marriage beyond 17 years can bring about a substantial reduction in fertility for a

noncontraceptive society like Bangladesh. However, it is not known from our data whether the higher age at marriage leads to lower fertility either through mere shortening of reproductive span or through greater motivation of these women to regulate their fertility. Higher age at marriage may itself indicate a strong desire on the part of the women to control fertility which in turn may be affected by their higher education and work experience.
There also is a positive relationship between age at marriage and use of contraception. However, difference in the current use of contraception between the cohort of women who married at very early ages (i.e., below 15years) and all other women is not statistically significant.
Work experience has very little or no effect on current use of contraception and fertility. Various reasons could be adduced to explain this finding: (i) There is very little variation between categories of work status. Nearly 90 per cent of the respondents are found to be nonworking. (ii) The absolute majority of women are engaged in the traditional sector of the economy (i.e., agriculture) and of those who are engaged in nonagricultural pursuits, the majority are in the tertiary sector.10 Therefore, incompatibility between the roles of mother and worker, the pivotal factor in determining differences in fertility levels between working and nonworking women, is lacking. (Hi) The working women usually originate from poor socioeconomic backgrounds in terms of

their parental and their husbands' education and income (Chaudhury, 1978). This poor socioeconomic background may be positively associated with fertility which may have attenuated the depressing effect of work on fertility.
The overall finding that work experience has little or no effect on fertility does not necessarily contradict previous findings elsewhere. Few studies have provided the careful control for age, parity, education, age at marriage, standard of living, etc., which we have used. Thus, some of the reported effects of female work experience may simply reflect the co-variation of work experience with these variables.
POLICY IMPLICATIONS
The study points to the need to improve women's status, particularly education, and also to raise age at marriage to obtain wider diffusion of contraception and successful reduction in fertility. Age at marriage can be raised through providing education and employment opportunities to women, and this finding is also borne out by data (Chaudhury and Nilufer, 1981) obtained from Bangladesh.
To improve the educational status of women, there is need to open more girls' schools and to change social attitudes on female education. In a traditional Muslim society like Bangladesh, co-education is not socially acceptable, particularly in rural areas. But there is a tremendous lack of girls' schools in Bangladesh.11 Mere expansion in girls' schools does not necessarily lead to

10According to the latest available data (1974 population census), only 30 per cent of women in the labor force were in the nonagricultural sector in 1974. Of these who were in the nonagricultural sector, nearly 79 per cent were accounted for by the tertiary and service sectors.

11In 1974-75, there were only 243 girls' primary schools in a country of 64,000villages. The number of girls' secondary schools was only 1,106 in 197475 (Dacca University, 1977).

more female education unless social attitudes are also changed. Parents prefer to seek higher education for sons rather than daughters, mainly because boys are considered a greater economic asset to the family than are girls.12 In addition, there is a need for a persistent drive against those social customs, beliefs, and traditions which belittle the value of women as compared to men. Efforts must be made to change attitudes that women are inferior to men13 and that "motherhood" is the most desirable role for a woman.
Advocates of family planning argue that reductions in fertility would permit women to pursue higher education and gainful employment in order to attain higher social status. But it can be equally forcibly argued that women who have attained higher status will want to practice contraception. Consequently, the raising of women's status appears crucial in the attempt to create an environment in which women will want to practice contraception in order to reduce fertility.
However, the effect on fertility and practice of contraception of introducing compulsory secondary education will be slow in a society where a majority of the people are illiterate. According to the 1974 Census of Bangladesh only 14.1
12All the male respondents in a recent village study considered sons as an economic asset and none had such expectation for the girls. In the above study it was also found that the fathers wanted their boys and girls to be high school graduates and primary school graduates respectively (Chaudhury and Latif, 1976).
13It was found in a study in Bangladesh that 70 per cent of rural and 80 per cent of urban men, respectively, considered women as inferior to men (Rounaq, 1975).

per cent of males and 2.9 per cent of females aged 15 and above were reported to have completed 6-10 years of education (Rabbani et al., 1976). Though the journey may be long and arduous, it must be started immediately. In the meantime, along with efforts to provide compulsory formal education at least up to secondary level, some kind of nonformal education should also be introduced. Employment opportunities outside the home may provide an effective forum of nonformal education, and this may lead to control of fertility through wider use of contraception, particularly among illiterate women. This is also borne out by data of the present study14 and those of other studies in Bangladesh (Chaudhury, 1978). For illiterates, alternative satisfactions to children are very limited. Participation in the labor force not only provides such alternative satisfactions but also provides further opportunities for acquiring new skills and techniques which may broaden their outlook and this may lead to wider use of contraception and reduction in fertility among illiterate women. For higher-education women, employment outside the home is one of the several alternative satisfactions to children.
For an effective lowering of fertility, the female age at marriage must be raised above 17 years. However, there are difficulties in implementing a minimum-age marriage law in a society like Bangladesh where social, religious, and economic pressures on girls to marry at an early age remain very

strong. Inthis society, a girl unmarried past acertain age may be consideredan embarrassment or disgrace to the family and itis also an economic burden on the parents to maintain an unmarried girl who is economically unproductive. In this situation concurrent measures of obvious benefit to the girls and their families, such as providing education and employment opportunities, haveto be taken forthe effective implementation of a minimum-age marriage law.
