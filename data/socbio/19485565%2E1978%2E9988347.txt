ABSTRACT: While there have been several conceptual analyses of pronatalist influences on fertility, a comparatively small amount of empirical work relates these forces to actual differentials in reproductive behavior. The impact of pronatalist incentives on the fertility of military couples in the United States is examined with data from the 1970 Public Use Samples. The findings failed to support the idea that such incentives lead to higher fertility. Implications of the findings for policies designed to lower fertility are discussed.

The effects of various pronatalist influences on human fertility have been recognized in the social science literature for at least sixty years. Hollingworth (1916), in an insightful early paper, identified a wide spectrum of means by which societies encourage reproduction. In recent years, concern over rapid population growth in both the developed and developing nations has led to increased interest in the topic. Most analyses begin with the assumption that pronatalist values and institutions evolved in response to the high and fluctuating mortality which has characterized mankind throughout most of history.
There are at least three levels at which pronatalist influences can be seen to operate. First, there are official governmental and organizational policies and procedures which have the intentional or unintentional effect of encouraging reproduction. Financial incentives and laws governing the availability of abortion are examples of policies which governments have used deliberately to raise the birth rate (David and Wright, 1971; Mclntyre, 1975; Teitelbaum, 1972). Discriminatory tax legislation that adversely affects single persons

and married couples without children, public housing allotments based on family size, and liberal maternity benefits including paid maternity leaves are thought to support reproduction even though this may not have been the intent (Blake, 1972; Davis, 1967). A second level of pronatalist influence stems from the existence of various social norms, values, and beliefs which stress the primacy of parental roles for adults and elevate parenthood (Blake, 1972). Much of the literature on sex roles and the feminist movement has concerned the direct, as well as the subtle but powerful, forces that encourage women to marry and bear children (Peck and Senderowitz, 1974). As Blake (1972) notes, even the feminist movement is basically supportive of motherhood, although critical of the disadvantages that accrue to women because of childbearing and rearing. Finally, pronatalist sex roles are often internalized into the personality structure of individuals, particularly women (Blake, 1972, 1974; Clarkson et al., 1970). Thus, women at an early age are subjected to pressures to "select personality traits and behavior patterns that are believed to be congruent with the status of wife and

A notable exception on antinatalist incentives is the work of Hohm (197S) on the effect on fertility of national social security programs.

Economic benefits associated with employment in the military have long been an attractive feature of military life. The provision of medical care, housing, shopping facilities, and other support services, in addition to attractive retirement benefits, are strong inducements for career military personnel.

None of these incentives were necessarily established with the intent of encouraging reproduction, although one Army captain, writing anonymously, has charged that Army policies are "actively pronatalist as well as discriminatory against those who do not have children"

was drawn from the 1/1,000 PUS and is composed of couples in which the husband was not in the military. The use of two different samples was necessary because the 1/1,000 PUS had too few military couples for the desired analysis, while the 1/100 PUS had too many civilian couples to process efficiently.

While these data refer only to costs surrounding the birth of a child, and not to dependent care coverage after delivery, it appears that military benefits for medical care, and particularly maternity coverage, are substantially greater than those enjoyed by most civilians. Since most civilian jobs make no provision for housing allowances, the disparity between military and civilian families in this area would be even greater. Thus, while no precise measure of the economic incentives were available, military couples clearly receive a number of benefits which reduce the direct cost of bearing and rearing children.
The incentives to reproduction in the military should operate in addition to those identified in the larger society. Thus, to the extent that the military serves as an exemplar of traditional values of the society (Janowitz, 1960), an added set of incentives can be expected to result in higher fertility.

Throughout the analysis we assumed that both the civilian and military samples could be treated as simple random samples of the populations they represent. Technically, this is not the case because census sample questions are cluster samples at the household level. Design factors have been calculated for the Public Use Samples (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1972, p. 189), and for the characteristics used in this analysis. All have design factors of 1.0 or less, except race, which has a design factor of 1.1. A design factor less than unity indicates that the sampling error obtained under a simple random sample assumption for a given characteristic will be somewhat inflated. Although the same statement cannot be extended to combinations of characteristics or regression analyses (Frankel, 1971; U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1972, p. 201), given that most of the design factors for the characteristics used were unity or less, we felt that the assumption of a simple random sample

The decision to use husband's occupation in 1970 to identify military couples was based on several considerations. Initially, some indicator of "career" military occupation was deemed desirable. This was based on the assumption that the cumulative impact of special incentives to childbearing in the military would be most pronounced among couples for whom the military was a career. However, an argument can be made that these incentives would operate on noncareer couples as well, particularly in influencing the timing of childbearing. Noncareer couples could transfer the direct costs of pregnancy and childbirth to the military by having desired births earlier than comparable civilian couples. If this were the case, then younger military couples (including the

RESULTS
Characteristics of both husbands and wives in the civilian and military samples are presented in Table 1. With the large number of cases included in the samples, it is not surprising that most of the differences between civilian and military couples were statistically significant. Civilian couples on the average were older and had higher incomes in 1969 than military couples. On the other hand, both the husband and wife were better educated in military families, and males in the military were less likely to have been married more than once. Because differences in age composition were not controlled, the higher aggregate fertility of civilian

single comparison, we find that the mean fertility of these two groups could easily be the same, and given the number of comparisons, it would be hard to reject the general hypothesis that the fertility of civilian and military couples is similar.

There are 31 comparisons of military and civilian couples that may be made for this age group. Military wives had slightly higher fertility in 6 instances; civilian women were higher in 20 of the 31 comparisons. However, the two groups were either equal or within 0.2 of each other for 24 of the 31 comparisons, and the largest mean difference in children ever born was only 0.4. The findings for younger couples clearly do not suggest a timing effect on fertility resulting from pronatalist incentives in the military.

Although no effect was found for younger couples, this does not eliminate the possibility that the cumulative fertility of older couples may be influenced. The overwhelming preference that Americans express for a family with at least two children, coupled with the disfavor in which childless and one child families are held (Griffith, 1973), suggest that pronatalist incentives may not operate until the minimum socially acceptable family size is achieved. If this is the situation, then incentives would not result in higher fertility

no effect would be seen among young couples, but some effect might be demonstrable for the fertility of older women.
For women 30 years old and over, 44 comparisons are afforded of the fertility of civilian and military couples (Table 2). The findings are quite similar to those in the younger age groups. Civilian and military couples have had a remarkably similar number of children. Of the 44 possible comparisons within the age, age at marriage, and educational categories, military couples exhibited higher fertility in 16 instances, civilian couples were higher in 20 cases, and the two groups were identical in 8 comparisons. Moreover, there was no pattern to the observed differences which did occur. The tabular results for older couples thus also fail to support the idea of higher fertility among military families.
Table 3 reports the results of a regression analysis performed in order to control simultaneously a larger number of variables which might influence the fertility of civilian and military couples. Regressions for military and civilian couples are shown separately as well as for the total sample.

The regression analysis supported the earlier findings that military status had no effect on fertility. A dummy variable for military/civilian occupation (coded military = 1, civilian = 0) was included with six other variables in a multiple regression analysis for the total combined samples. Military status was the only variable which was not statistically significant and the sign was in the opposite direction. It should be noted that the weighting procedure required for the combination of the two samples reduced the chance that the occupational variable would be significant due to the relatively small number of military couples. However, even when the regression was run on the unweighted sample--a procedure which causes military families to be over-represented by a factor of ten--the opposite sign prevails (results not shown). (For a discussion and example of the effects of weighting upon regression results based on disproportionate stratified sampling, see Erlanger, 1977, p. 236).
The separate regressions for the military and civilian samples provide the opportunity to examine the effects of other vari-

wife was the single most important variable followed by her age at first marriage and her education. Race of wife was also an important predictor of children ever born. Black women had borne more children than white women, and this effect appeared somewhat stronger among civilian than military women. Women married more than once had lower fertility than those in a single union. Finally, family income had a small positive effect on children ever born, but it was the weakest predictor of the variables included, and its substantive significance is questionable in view of the large sample size.

The data of this study failed to support the idea that such incentives lead to higher fertility. No effect was found either for young couples, for whom we thought a timing and/or spacing effect might possibly operate, or for older couples whose cumulative fertility was hypothesized to differ. The findings were distinguished primarily by the remarkable similarity in the reproductive behavior of couples who received the incentives and those who did not.
The failure to find higher fertility among military couples may be due to several considerations. First, the incentives

In addition, the periodic absence of the male paradoxically may operate to increase fertility by increasing the psychological importance of the mother role with its attendant pressure for higher fertility (Rainwater, 196S; Stokes, 1973). Because some of the effects of separation may be offsetting, we do not feel that periodic separations of military couples account for the failure to find higher fertility in the military.

tive status factor of early adulthood would operate when he argues that "variations from one cohort to another in relative status circumstances will tend through their effect on early childbearing experience to produce shifts, chiefly within the two- to four-child range, in ideals and expectations about completed family size."
The combination of social and economic forces in this theory of fertility would appear, on both theoretical and empirical grounds, to have a greater effect on reproductive behavior than the incentives examined in this study.
