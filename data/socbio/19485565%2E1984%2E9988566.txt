ABSTRACT: In the present investigation, it is observed that there are at least six endogamous Mala populations namely, the Tangala, the Maladasari, the Pakanati, the Rampala, the Murikinati, and the Bommanati inhabiting the two taluks of Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh. From the projected distribution of these populations, it is evident that the populations show a regionality in their distribution, without any overlapping even when two different populations inhabit the same village. It can also be inferred that the six Mala populations satisfy Wright's island model of breeding structure. These populations show low mean marriage distances. Within each there is some degree of breeding isolation by distance, and there is an approach to the neighborhood or, more aptly, the stepping stone model.

The present study aimed to obtain information about the nature of distribution of the population of the Malas, a scheduled caste1 population of Andhra Pradesh, and the isolates contained in them in different eco-cultural zones and to ascertain endogamy and isolation by marriage distance.
The Malas, one of the largest and continuously distributed populations of India, are found in almost every village of Andhra Pradesh and the neighboring states. The Malas, formerly "untouchables," occupy the lowest status in the Hindu hierarchy. Generally, they live outside the main village. They are poor and depend on agricultural labor for others. Very few cultivate their own land.
1Socio-economically backward (untouchable) castes were named as scheduled castes by the Government in 1938. (Issacs, 1965).

MATERIALS AND METHODS Samples have been drawn from two taluks, Chittoor and Madanapalle of Chittoor district, Andhra Pradesh (Figure 1). From these two taluks, 10 per cent of villages listed alphabetically and numbered serially in the 1971Census Hand Book of Chittoor District were selected by systematic random sampling assuming that these selected villages cover 10per cent of the Mala population and form a representative sample of each taluk. The first village was picked by random sampling using the tippet random numbers for each taluk separately. Afterwards, using this selected one as the first village, we included every tenth village in the list for this investigation.
A house-to-house census of the Malas inhabiting the selected villages was followed by a systematic collection of the demographic data through the construction of bilateral geneaological trees or, more appropriately, pedigrees. The information collected concerned the

names of the endogamous groups, the marriages, with particular reference to endogamy or exogamy, and the distance between the birthplaces of spouses

(called here "marriage distance"). The marriage distance was estimated in miles by most common roads. The genealogical and census data included all the

available subjects belonging to the Mala population in the area of study. Along with the collection of data, the social and geographical boundaries of the distribution of the population and marriage distance of the couples were also gathered from the informants and also analyzed from the demographic data.
From the census data and other anthropological information thus collected, it is obvious that there are at least six Mala populations in the area of study. They are Tangala (TG), Maladasari (MD), Pakanati (PN), Rampala (RP), Murikinati (MN) and Bommanati (BN). Their distribution, sizes, and relative densities are shown in Figure 1 and Table 1.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The demographic data and data on marriages were analyzed to identify and locate the endogamous populations belonging to the Mala caste in the area of study. The actual occurrence of the particular endogamous divisions of the Malas in this area and their projected distribution as can be inferred from these data are plotted in Figure 1.

DISTRIBUTION OF THE POPULATION
It is to be noted that the Mala populations identified and located in the two taluks do not exhaust the list of the Mala populations of Andhra Pradesh. However, the nature of distribution, isolation, and spread of the populations in the study area may be assumed to reflect the general pattern of the demographic structure and composite organization of the Mala community. The available information about the centers of concentration and dispersion of the populations in relation to ecological and cultural surroundings may also indicate to some extent the general nature of the dispersion of the Mala population ever in other areas.
In the Chittoor taluk, three Mala populations, namely, the Pakanati (PN), the Maladasari (MD) and the Tangala (TG), have been found to inhabit the ten villages surveyed. From the nature of distribution of the populations in the villages of Chittoor taluk, it can be surmised that the Mala community in this taluk is constituted solely or principally by these three subdivisions. Again, most of the taluk is inhabited by the Tangala. The Tangala population, which forms the major sample of the present investigation, appears to be the predominant group in terms of the area of distribution, density, and size of population in the sample area, barring the Maladasari.
In Madanapalle taluk, there are four Mala populations, namely the Pakanati (PN), the Bommanati (BN), the Murikinati (MN), and the Rampala (RP). Here the Rampala form the major sample, but the sample is smaller than that of the Tangala of the Chittoor taluk. It can also be surmised from the nature of

data on distribution that these four populations represented in the sample villages are the only ones, or at least the major ones, inhabiting the taluk, as far as the Mala community is concerned. From the distribution, it appears that the Rampala is the predominant population in this taluk in terms of the area of distribution and size. It is worthwhile to mention that some of the villages had no Mala population during the time of investigation. These villages lie towards the southern parts of Madanapalle taluk and are at relatively high altitude with sparse agriculture. It can be surmised from subjects that there are no Mala populations distributed toward the southern part of Madanapalle taluk.
From the nature of the distribution and the projection that is reasonably made on the basis of demographic data obtained from the villages (Figure 1), certain general observations can be made about the nature of the distribution. The populations show a regionality in their distribution. There is hardly any overlapping of populations even when two different populations may sometimes inhabit the same villages and are thus called sympatric. The Tangala, the predominant population of Chittoor taluk, is located more toward south and east, the Maladasari toward central west, and the Pakanati to the northwestern fringe of the taluk. The three (RP, MN, and BN) of the four populations of Madanapelle taluk appear to be limited to the western region and do not extend to the east. It is significant to note that a small settlement of the Pakanati has been met within a village on the eastern border of Madanapelle taluk. It is posble to expect on the basis of the demographic data on their distribution and location that the Pakanati population

may be dispersed throughout the central part of the Chittoor district and the limits of their distribution are represented by the bordering villages of these two taluks. It is possible to support this hypothesis on the basis of the available data on ethnic populations in this area.
It has been suggested by Thurston (1909) that the term Pakanati is derived from "Pakanadu" which literally means "the land toward the east." There is at least one more population, the Pakanati Reddy, which forms a major agricultural population of the same district. Whether the term "Pakanati" has been borrowed by the particular Mala population from the majority of Reddy or Kapu, a peasant population from the same area, or whether this Mala population has been known by that name from earlier times, it can be logically surmised that the Pakanati Malas are a population who form the local inhabitants of Chittoor district. It is possible that the Pakanati Malas may have an even wider distribution in the Chittoor district than the Tangala or the Rampala which appear to be predominant in the area of sampling.
ENDOGAMY
A total of 885 marriages have been studied from the six endogamous populations (Table 2). All the marriages except 2 out of 551among the Tangala and 1 out of 139 among the Rampala have been contracted between individuals belonging to the respective divisions of the Mala community. All of the three exogamous marriages have taken place among the men of the respective Mala population and women belonging to the other castes such as the Kurava and Chakali community (the washerman caste). They indicate a small amount of

gene flow from Kurava and Chakali populations. The admixture is rather negligible from thepoint ofview of identifying thepopulations as endogamous units. Such small exceptions to endogamy can obviously be expected tooccur in all populations and does not provide sufficient evidence against considering the Mala populations as breedingisolates. It is reasonable to expect a similarly small degree of admixture among the other four populations if larger data on marriages could be available for them.
It may benoted that theexogamous marriages have not occurred between any pair ofthe populations under study in the sample data and thus itcan be assumed that the six Mala populations in-

habiting the two taluks satisfy Wright's island model (Wright, 1969). There is no preference for the other populationsbelonging to thesocial castes inthecasesin which social barriers of mating have been broken.
Another factor which contributes to the breeding and genetic isolation within each of these populations is a high incidence of matings between closely related individuals. The frequency of consanguineous marriages for six Mala populations range from 26.76 to 38.75 per cent. This considerably higher frequency isdue totheir occupation as cultivators inthe ruralfieldsand the fact that they are theleast urbanized and least educated population in this area. Their poor economy and prefer-

ence for mates within kin groups are also some of the reasons for this higher incidence of consanguinity.
ISOLATION BY MARRIAGE DISTANCE
Although the six Mala populations identified during the investigation have been treated as breeding isolates following the island model of Sewall Wright (1969), the wide area of continuous distribution of these populations calls for an investigation into the nature and extent of the geographical breeding isolation within each of these populations. For this purpose the data on distance between the birth place of spouses in miles, called marriage distance, have
' °'
been analyzed from a comparative point of view (Table 3). The Tangala show a low mean marriage distance of 7.72 miles while the other five divisions of Malas give a mean marriage distance in the range of 10.03 to 15.71 miles. The low value for the Tangala population

may be due to a higher density of this population is Chittoor taluk. Because of these low mean marriage distances in these populations of Mala, groups of people within each division are isolated by distance and form into small overlapping Mendelian populations, approaching a stepping stone model with continuous variation of genetic traits between adjacent groups of people,
