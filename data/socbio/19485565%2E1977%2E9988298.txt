ABSTRACT: While inbreeding levels have declined in most parts of the world, they are still high in South India. Based on a major study of rural and urban population samples, the extent of inbreeding in Tamil Nadu, one of the southern states of India, is presented and analyzed in relation to specific socioeconomic and demographic factors. The inbreeding coefficients (Wright's F) in the rural and urban areas were 0.0371 and 0.0204, respectively. Although the levels were generally high in all population groups, the coefficients showed significant variations by religion, education, and occupational status of the couple, and by place of residence. Data over the past several decades indicate that inbreeding continues to be maintained at relatively high levels even today.

Theoretical treatises based largely on sociocultural studies are found on the origin of incest taboos and consanguinity regulations (Tylor, 1889; Westermark, 1921; Freud, 1946; Levi-Strauss, 1949; Parsons, 1954). Currently, there are only a few populations in the world that show a preference toward consanguineous marriages. In a majority of these populations, the levels of inbreeding are rather low, rarely exceeding S per cent of the marriages and with inbreeding coefficients less than 0.01 (Cavalli-Sforza and Bodmer, 1971).
The average inbreeding coefficient in Europe has been reported as varying between 0.00005 and 0.0011 (Pohlman, 1951; Sutter, 1958; Deraemaeker, 1958). In the Americas, the inbreeding coefficients vary from 0.00009 to 0.00119 (Freire-Maia, 1968). One of the few national populations with substantial levels of inbreeding is Japan. Schull and Neel (1965) estimate the frequency of consanguineous marriage to be around 10 per cent of all marriages in Japan, with the inbreeding coefficients between 0.008 and 0.003. Only in certain small isolates can

one observe higher levels of inbreeding, such as 0.0254 among the Dunkers of Pennsylvania (Glass et al., 1954), 0.0365 on the island of Tristan da Cunha (Bailit et al., 1966), and 0.0434 among the Samaritan isolates in the Middle East (Bonne, 1963).
In contrast, there seems to exist in southern parts of India a high level of inbreeding extending to large populations across all religions and socioeconomic groups. An earlier report from the state of Tamil Nadu indicated the frequency of consanguineous marriages in the rural and urban areas as around 50 per cent and 30 per cent of all marriages, respectively (Rao etal., 1972). Closer scrutiny of these populations through detailed analyses using inbreeding coefficients are presented and discussed in this paper.

dependent on the educational level, the inbreeding coefficients by occupations of women and of their husbands showed patterns similar to those seen in Table 4. However, in certain occupational groups, such as agricultural laborers, semiskilled workers in cottage industries, and service workers, there were significantly higher coefficients of inbreeding as compared to those in the white-collar group in both the rural and urban areas (P < 0.0S). It should be pointed out, however, that differentials by occupational categories were more pronounced in the rural than in the urban areas.
Inbreeding coefficients by religion of rural and urban couples are presented in Table 5. The highest coefficients of inbreeding were seen for Hindus; nearly l.S times those seen among Muslims or Christians. In general, the inbreeding rates

were lower in urban than in rural areas for all religious groups.
The Hindu community consists of hierarchical groups (castes and subcastes), each with its own rights, duties, and privileges. The various caste names are derived from the principal professions or crafts their members practiced. Thus, the Brahmins conducted prayers and religious rituals and were involved in teaching; Kshatriyas were rulers and warriors. The

potters, blacksmiths, carpenters, washermen, etc., each had their own caste names. The castes at the top had power and privileges which were denied to the lower castes, who were tenants, servants, landless laborers, debtors, and clients of the higher castes. In recent years, the lower castes have shown an increasing desire to free themselves from the control of the locally dominant castes and have been assisted by political forces operating from higher levels. However, the social status of an individual is still dependent on his caste. The caste status of communities in this study can be classified into three groups: (1) the "Forward" communities, consisting of higher caste groups, including Brahmins, those engaged primarily in white-collar jobs, and some skilled workers; (2) the "Backward" communities, consisting of the traditionally lower castes such as those involved in semiskilled work or manual labour; and (3) the "Scheduled" communities, composed of tribal and caste groups who have remained aloof from the mainstream of the society and are the most undeveloped.
The inbreeding coefficients by castes varied from 0.05 to less than 0.02. In general, the coefficients in the urban areas were lower than those in the rural areas for each of these castes, the differences attaining statistical significance (P < 0.05).
The inbreeding coefficients are given in Table 6 for the three groups of communities having different social statuses. The differences in inbreeding coefficients

between rural and urban areas for each status group attain statistical significance (P < 0.001). In both areas, the Backward communities show the highest coefficients of inbreeding. The lowest /''-values are seen for the Forward communities in the rural areas, but for the Scheduled communities in the urban areas. The differences between these two groups, however, are not statistically significant (0.2 < P < 0.4).
Inbreeding coefficients by year of consummation of marriage of couples did not reveal significant declines over the past five decades. The inbreeding coefficients in the rural and urban areas were 0.0297 and 0.0189, respectively, for those married in 1919 or earlier and 0.0304 and 0.0173 for those married in 1960 or later.
DISCUSSION
Most investigations of consanguineous marriages have relied on documentary evidence such as civil marriage registers, church registers of marriages and of special dispensations needed for consanguineous marriages, hospital records, and registers maintained in rehabilitation institutes or recorded genealogies (CavalliSforza and Bodmer, 1971). These sources are not all of the same quality and suffer from many limitations. They represent "selected" population groups where the amount and types of bias remain unknown, and they may have various kinds of inaccuracies. Incest, as well as illegal marriages, may not have been recorded. However, these data provide some idea of the incidence of consanguineous marriage in various societies and at certain periods of time. The Japanese studies have a special advantage because of the existence of family registers, the koseki, that provide documentary evidence of the type of consanguinity involved, if any (Schull and Neel, 196S). Population-based samples

and community surveys, such as the present study, provide relatively superior material for study, although they are costly since considerable time is required for the collection of reliable data.
Prohibition of sexual relations among persons in certain kinship categories appears to be one of the few universal socid restrictions on human behavior (Lorimer, 1954). In practice, this, principle is expressed in an infinite variety of rules, mythological justifications, and types and degrees of extension. While there are a large number of castes and tribes in India, this situation does not necessarily lead to a great deal of inbreeding, since the numerical strength of the different groups is sufficiently large to provide many possibilities for nonconsanguineous marriages. Further, there are many regulations governing marriages between close relatives. The regulations have been strictly enforced in northern India, especially by the Brahmins, who greatly influence the marriage customs of other population groups. However, in southern India the regulations had to be relaxed considerably to conform to the prevailing marked preferences for consanguineous marriages (Sanghvi, 1966). In the present study, the extent of consanguinity is fairly high in all of the major religious groups, although some significant differences were found (Table 6).
There are many reasons for the preference for consanguineous marriages, but the chief one is socioeconomic. In a study of the mating customs of people residing in one of the southern states of India, Andhra Pradesh, Dronamraju (1964) cites the main reasons, as stated by the respondents, for preferring consanguineous marriages: (a) to keep the cultivable land in larger subdivisions for growing food crops such as rice; (b) parental influence; (c) the extreme youth of the brides; (d) mutual knowledge of families concerned;

and (e) economic benefits, since the parents and the grandparents of the consanguineous spouses and their descendants can all live together in joint families, pooling their resources and sharing all expenditures.
A sizeable proportion of marriages are still arranged by parents, for whom the perpetuation and prosperity of the family takes precedence over individual preferences about marriage partners. Even in the urban areas, a significant proportion of marriages are still arranged by the parents, regardless of differentials in educational or occupational status of the spouses involved (Tables 4 and 5).
Studies in most parts of the world have shown significant declines in the incidence of consanguineous marriages. For example, in the Netherlands, the frequency of consanguineous marriages declined from 0.7 per cent in 1906-18 to 0.2 per cent during 1937-48 (Pohlman, 1951). In Belgium, the frequency declined from 1.4 per cent at the turn of century to less than 0.9 per cent by 1950 (Deraemaeker, 1958). However, in southern India, the declines over the past few decades do not seem significant.
If a character whose correlation with inbreeding is being investigated happens to show a geographical-social stratification, then spurious correlations can be easily obtained. This point must be borne in mind when exploring inbreeding effects on human populations in different parts of the world where consanguineous marriages have declined to rather insignificant levels. Likewise, studies based on parish records or genealogies maintained by select population groups are liable to suffer from varying degrees of bias which can never be adequately estimated or corrected for. In contrast, community-based studies on southern Indian populations offer excellent opportunities to study inbreeding effects, in view of the wide popu-

larity of consanguineous marriages. Such investigations would also be helpful in determining the long-term effects of inbreeding on specific gene frequencies.
