ers (1978) and Mosk (1983) have proposed that the changes were prompted by family efforts to conserve resources, such as land, which lose their value when too finely divided. Intuitively, this hypothesis seems reasonable. Nonsimultaneous changes in different geographic areas were correlated with settlement patterns and population density (Lockridge, 1983). A careful reading of Mosk's (1983) analysis of fertility and patrilineal inheritance suggests that individuals with more resources are likely to pursue quite different reproductive strategies than those with few resources, and that when inheritance is sex-biased, there may be different impacts on men's versus women's reproductive lives.
The hypothesis that resource control is effective in establishing and continuing family lines suggests that individuals in the population will not all experience the same costs and benefits under any economic regime. Thus, individuals with greater/lesser resources seem likely to follow different strategies, or to be differentially successful with similar strategies. Further, the nature of the resource is important. Some resources, such as herds of cattle, or money, can increase; others, such as land, do not increase and may lose all value when they are sufficiently subdivided (nonpartible). Under these constraints, certain predictions follow:
1. When the resource base is extensive, with limited pressure on it, and individuals can acquire plentiful resources, those individuals with large amounts of resources should produce more children than individuals with fewer resources. This prediction will not hold when (1) infant mortality rates are uneven across classes, or (2) the role of children is itself that of a resource, i.e., labor to acquire land (see Johansson,

1987). However, in nineteenth-century Sweden, access to health care was relatively egalitarian, and, while sons often worked on a father's farm, it is not clear that their labor assisted parents in obtaining additional land above that used for the sons themselves.
2. When a major (nonpartible) resource becomes limiting, family size should decrease for resource-holding families, and family size should become more equal across the society. Thus, if heritable resources are important to children's (especially sons') eventual success, as these resources become restricted, affected families seem likely to restrict family size to ensure effectiveness of remaining resources.
3. For families with resources to bequeath, unequal distribution of resources among children may represent an advantageous reproductive strategy. Though this cannot be measured directly without examination of wills (Smith et al., 1986), when unequal distribution occurs, unequal reproductive performance should also be seen. Given the legal constraints in Sweden, which during the period of this study tended to favor sons over daughters, and to favor first-born sons, unequal reproduction in this sample should be seen with parity (birth order) in sons but not daughters.
4. When a major (nonpartible) resource becomes limiting, migration rates should increase, and these rates should differ for sons of different status families (but not daughters), and for sons of different parity within resourceholding families. Sons not inheriting resources may have a better chance to succeed by leaving the parish, rather than remaining in their home parish. Thus, resource-holding sons should remain, using their resources to enhance their lifetime success, as did their fathers,

there fields of sufficient fertility for farming. At the beginning of the period covered in this study, a few very large land-holdings existed in Locknevi, controlled by a small number of individuals. The amount of land under cultivation increased in the nineteenth century. However, much of the freeholders' land was subdivided so that landholdings became progressively smaller, and some newly cultivated holdings were in agriculturally marginal land. Thus, resource holdings shifted from being relatively uneven with some very large holdings to being more even but with more restricted holdings.

In order to maximize the size and continuity of lineage records and so that fathers and sons could not appear in the same record, the sample comprised all men married between 1824 when records began and 1840in Locknevi parish (n = 175), and all their descendants (n=2,101) (Table 1). Descendents were defined as those whose parenthood, through baptismal or birth records, could be reliably established. It is thus a conservative estimate, since some records might be lost, and some fathers of illegitimate children might not acknowledge them. Of the 2,101 descendants born, 915 remained alive in the parish to

culated. Because this measure is based on mother's age at the child's birth, and Generation 1contained only men, it was calculated for Generations 2-4.
Standard demographic measures are designed to allow predictions about populations. Because they are aggregate measures, they might vary depending on the relative representation of subgroups if subgroups behave differently, and the strength of intergroup differences is difficult to assess because intragroup variance is not reflected. Since the focus of this study is individual and familial patterns, new measures, built from the individual and family patterns, reflecting variance and allowing for the testing of strength in intergroup differences, were used in addition to the standard ones. In this study, I was able to measure actual lifetime fertility (NBC=number of biological children born) for many individuals. In addition, I was able to calculate for each individual the survivorship (5^) and mortality rates of their children to age ten, and the resulting number of children alive at age ten (RSW). This measure, RSW, is a "net success" measure for each family, the result of the interaction of other measures analyzed here: probability of marrying, age at marriage, age at birth of first child, marital fertility rate, and childhood survivorship. RSw thus represents a summary measure reflecting the probable net success of any family lineage as a function of the fertility and survivorship particular to that family. Both NBC and RSiowill tend to be somewhat lower than aggregate measures such as TFR, because some individuals die before completing their reproductive lifespans. The individual family measures NBC and RSi0 were restricted to those adults living their lives within the parish.

Age-specific fertility and total fertility rates do not require this restriction.
When people moved out of the parish, their records were truncated. To estimate net lifetime and multigenerational differences in patterns requires a summary measure of patterns in occupational status and reproduction, one that accounts for differences in record loss. One such approach is the comparison of reproductive success per year of reproductive life under observation. The number of children born, or surviving to age ten, was divided by the number of years of reproductive life for which records exist (age at death or record loss minus 15for men; age at death/ record loss, or age 45, whichever was less, minus 15 for women). This measure supplements the measures NBC and RSio(which were restricted to those individuals living their entire lives in the parish). Obviously age-specific fertility is important, since fertility diminishes as age increases. However, because the sample is structured so that individuals enter through becoming married in the first generation, and only through birth in subsequent generations, and there is no influx of mature individuals, any bias in the relationship is consistent.
Statistical analyses were done using the MIDAS and BMDP statistical packages on the Michigan Terminal System. For analysis of marital and occupational patterns, the sample was restricted to individuals surviving past age 15, in order to separate the effects of childhood mortality from effects of occupational status. Analysis of variance was restricted to problems (e.g., survivorship rate within the family) for which data were continuous and normally distributed (Conover, 1980). Although ANOVA's are typically used for analysis of number

The total fertility rate for Locknevi parish, based on all women in the sample (thus excluding Generation 1) was 3,786 births per 1,000 women, which isa median value for this period (Lockridge, 1983).

a man's father's class and the man's lifetime fertility (NBC: « = 192, KW=5.5, p = 0.24. RSW: n = 192, KW=4.8, p=0.34).
Remarriage was important to men's lifetime reproduction. Men who were married more than once (« = 25; maximum number of marriages = 4) had more children (NBC: n = 309, KW=6.16, d.f. = l , p = 0.01) and more children surviving to age ten (RSIQ: n = 309, KW=4.38, d.f. = l, p = 0.04) than men married only once. Most likely to marry more than once weretorpare (9/79, 10.2 per cent) and uppermiddle-class men (1/4,25 per cent).
A number of reproductive patterns changed significantly between the first generation in the sample (ancestral cohort) and all subsequent generations. Men in the ancestral cohort, married between 1824-40, married at a slightly older age (28.7 ± 9.1) than their male descendants (27.3 ± 4.9; d.f. = 330, F=2.63, p = 0.11), if all classes are

lumped. Class differences in age at marriage existed in the descendant generations while no class differences were evident in Generation 1 (Table 3).Torpare andstatare/proletariat men married earlier in the descendant generations than in the initial cohort. Class differences in number of fertile years existed in the first years, but not in subsequent ones (Table 4).
Family size decreased over the study period (Table 5, Fig. 1). Thus, marital fertility was reduced by the 1860's in Locknevi. In 1841-50, few couples married, and these couples had few children. It is important to note that this decade was a period of hard climatic conditions (Utterstrom, 1957, II, pp. 442-443), with several seasons having significant crop failures, followed by harsh winters.
In Generation 1, both the number of children born during a man's lifetime and the number of those children surviving to age ten varied significantly with a

man's best occupational status. Both decreased with status. In Generations 2 and 3, NBC varied nonlinearly, and RSioshowed only a nonsignificant trend (Fig. 2, Table 5). Survivorship within the family also varied with occupational status in the first generation (though the relationship was only marginally significant), but not in Generations 2-4 (Table 6). The within-family survivorship was lowest for statare/proletariat families in Generation 1, but increased in Generations 2-4 (Table 6). No married upper-middle-class men remained in the sample in Generation 2. Fertility fell for lower-middle-class men; statarel proletariat fertility remained low (Fig. 2, Table 5).
In terms of the increase or decrease of lineages, not only the total number of children produced is important, but also whether those children are produced early or late in the parents' lives. Children produced early in life will bear grandchildren earlier than those born later (Fisher, 1930), and if lineages consistently reproduce earlier than others, they have a more rapid rate of increase (m =r, Fisher, 1930). When the reproductive rates NBC/year and RSio/ytai are calculated, an interesting summary pattern emerges. In the first generation, there was no difference with class in the

number of children produced per year, but the impacts of the other influences discussed here result in a significant linear pattern. Married men of higher occupational status had, per year of records during reproductive life, more children surviving to age ten (Fig. 2, Table 7). In Generations 2-4, the pattern was reversed. A significant difference existed in the number of children born per year of records during reproductive life, but not in the number of surviving to age ten (Table 7).
FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE PATTERNS
Sixty-one per cent (262/430) of the women surviving past age 15in this sample failed to marry while in the parish. Women's age at marriage and agespecific fertility is summarized in Figure 3 (also see Sex Differences, below). Some form of family limitation behavior is evident from Fig. 3. Women's agespecific fertility peaks much later than their age at marriage.
No pattern was apparent in women's likelihood of marriage and father's occupational status (n = 425, x2= 4.40, p=0.36). Women who married earlier were somewhat more likely to have more children than those who married later (regression: n = 144, r = 0.18,

Further, women's lifetime production of children and number of children ah've at age ten were not related to their father's occupation (NBC: n = 182, KW=3.63, d.f. = 4, p = 0.46. RSW: n = 182, KW=AM, d.f. = 4, p = 0.21) or their husband's occupation (NBC: n = 142, KW=1.71, d.f. = 4, p =0J9. RS10: n = U2, KW=193, d.f. = 4, p = 0.75). Only 4 women in the sample married more than once. The number of marriages did not appear to influence a woman's lifetime fertility (« = 146, KW= 1.15, d.f. = l,p = 0.28) or number of children surviving to age ten (RSW: n = 146, KW=0.41, d.f. = l,p = 0.52).

It is possible that women married to men of different occupations, while having no net differences in total lifetime reproduction, nonetheless produced children at different rates, and showed mortality schedules that differed. When women's rates of reproduction were analyzed by husband's occupational status, no patterns were apparent in NBC/ year (n = 143, KW=0.74, /J= 0.95) or /?Sio/year (n = 143, KW=2.6,p=0.62). The survivorship of women married to men of different occupational status also did not differ (n = 419, Wilcoxin = 3.98, d.f. = 3, /? = 0.26; Savage = 3.06, d.f. = 3,p=0.38).
For all the measures computed, then, differences in the resources controlled by the fathers and husbands of women in this sample did not directly influence women's reproductive patterns.

leave (57.2 per cent) than daughters of lower middle class men (63.3 per cent), torpare (69.4 per cent), and statarel proletariat (69.7 per cent).
While men's occupational status had no effect on likelihood of migration out of the parish, parity was important. Earlier-born men (first or second born) were more likely to stay in the parish (59 per cent) than men who were third or fourth born (51.7 per cent), or laterborn (33.6 per cent) («=549, d.f. = 2, X2= 22.35, p =0.00001). For women, parity made no difference in probability of migrating (n=427, d.f. = 2, x2=3.09, p = 0.21). Thus Hypothesis 4 was supported.
For women, unmarried fertility appeared to be related to likelihood of outmigration. Married women were equally likely to stay in the parish whether they had children or not; unmarried women with children were more likely to leave the parish than married women or unmarried women without children (w= 162, d.f. = l, x2=4.0, p=0.05).
LEGITIMACY
The parish records track the legitimacy status of all individuals born. The illegitimacy rate was low in this sample. Forty of 1,799 births (2.2 per cent) were recorded as illegitimate (33) or occurring during betrothal (7) of the parents. Most of these births were first children of unmarried women who then had further children (« = 33), although not all of these were born during the betrothal period. For nine of the 40 births, the father's occupation was recorded. Of the 33 illegitimate children, three were fathered by men whose best occupation was statare/proletariat; 30 illegitimate children had no paternity assigned. Of

the 7 births during the betrothal period, four had fathers who were statarel proletariat, one had a torpare father, and one had a farmer father (one = unknown). Either higher-status men produced no illegitimate children, or the likelihood of men acknowledging paternity was strongly associated with their occupational status (« = 1,718, x2 = 39.81, p = 0.00001, G-K Gamma = 0.86,se=0.10).
Illegitimacy had important impacts. Only about half of the illegitimate children born survived to age ten (Jc = 0.52±0.45), compared to threefourths of children born within marriages (* = 0.76±0.31) and the difference is significant (ANOVA, F= 10.06, p =0.002). Only three illegitimate individuals remained in the sample to maturity. However, these three did not appear to be at a reproductive disadvantage in terms of numbers of children produced.
SEX DIFFERENCES
Women married earlier than men (*/=23.6 years, *m = 28.1, * = 7.02, p =0.00001, d.f. = 494), and this difference was evident for individuals of all different occupations. A greater percentage of women lived their entire lives in the parish without marrying or producing children than did men (n = 1,101, X2= 13.10, p = 0.003). Women were mor likely to leave the parish than men (62.9 per cent versus 49 per cent; n = l,101,x2=20.5,p = 0.00001).
Men were somewhat more likely to remarry than were women; 7.6 per cent (26/344) of adult men married more than once (from 2-4 times), while 2.1 per cent (4/194) of women married twice. No woman in the sample married more than twice.

more often than women, it is typical for men's reproductive lives to vary more than women's. That is, more men than women fail to marry and have children, and the most prolific men have far more children than the most prolific women (Bateman, 1948; Alexander, 1979; review by Low, 1988). In this sample, however, the variance in men's production of children born, and surviving to age ten, was not significantly greater than the variance for women (Table 9); in fact, because more women than men who remained in the sample failed to marry, the reproductive variance tended to be slightly, although not significantly, higher for women. A significant

difference in reproductive rate, and variance in reproductive rate, was apparent between the sexes (Table 9). Women produced more children per year during their (shorter) reproductive years than did men, and the variance in women's RSio/year exceeded that for men.
Typically, sex differences exist in survivorship of children. Male mortality exceeds female mortality in the early years (Alexander, 1974). Biologically, this is an expected pattern. When one sex (in humans, males) requires more energy expenditure (e.g., is carried in utero longer, nurses more, and more frequently), that sex typically has a lower survivorship during dependency. However, familial valuation of sons versus daughters might influence this pattern (Hammeletal., 1983; Johansson, 1984). Johansson (1984) suggested that under conditions of mechanized agriculture there may be trends to undervaluing daughters, resulting in more even patterns of dependent male or female mortality, or perhaps female mortality in excess of male mortality.
In this sample, survivorship of daughters to age ten was not significantly different from that of sons («= 1,129, d.f. = l, Wilcoxin/Breslow = 0.0001, p = 0.99, Savage/Mantel-Cox = 0.005, /> = 0.94). For sons and daughters of farmers and torpare (agricultural occupations), there was also no significant

difference (n = 876, d.f. = l, Wilcoxin/ Breslow = 0.11, />= 0.79 Savage/ Mantel-Cox = 8.08, p =0.79). This lack of the expected bias toward higher female survivorship may represent a mild case of the situation Johansson (1984) described. Comparison of age of death, considering only those individuals whose entire life was spent in the parish (so that age at death is known exactly), of sons versus daughters by father's occupation, shows that sons of farmers and torpare (land-based occupations) live significantly longer than daughters (Table 10).No differences in age of death of sons and daughters are apparent for any other occupations.
SOCIAL AND MARITAL MOBILITY
Men's occupations were strongly linked to those of their fathers (n = 542, X2=918.40,p=0.00001). Thus, with the occupational categories used, little social mobility was apparent. There appeared to be reproductive consequences associated with occupational mobility for men. Men who moved "up" were likelier than predicted to have fewer than the median number of children, and fewer than the median number of children surviving to age ten (NBC: w = 542, x2=10.0, /> = 0.04. RS10: /z=542,x2=19.1,p=0.0008). Whether this finding represents a conflict between effort required to accumulate resources versus that available to invest in offspring, or whether men who moved up followed a strategy of concentrating resources in fewer children is not clear from this sample.
Women tended to marry men of the same occupational status as their fathers (n = 162, x2=187.4, p =0.0001). Using the occupational categories described above, we find 41 of 162women married

"up" or "down." In some societies, marrying up (hypergyny) results in increased fertility (e.g., Dickemann, 1979). In this sample, marrying up or down appeared to have no reproductive impact for women (NBC: « = 162, X2=1.8, p = 0J6. RS1Q: « = 162, X2=0.9, p =0.91).
DISCUSSION
This paper examined the effects of status, as reflected by occupation, on marriage, fertility, and survival of children in Locknevi Parish, Sweden. In the firstgeneration (men married 1824-40), greater differences in the range of occupations existed than in subsequent generations. Men's reproductive patterns varied in concert with their occupational status. Little occupational mobility was apparent for men. This would suggest, other things being equal, that the reproductive differentials would accumulate over time. However, by the second generation in the sample, during the period of apparent resource constriction in Locknevi Parish as land became scarcer and parcels became smaller (Gerger and Hoppe, 1980), reproductive differentials associated with occupation disappeared. Family size and rate of production of children decreased during this period as well. Hypotheses 1 and 2 were thus supported.
As Knodel (1986) has pointed out, the classic demographic transition model gives central importance to correlations in fertility and mortality. The question is whether fertility decline occurs in the context of mortality decline/ survivorship increase (Livi-Bacci, 1986). In this study, overall survivorship of infants and children up to age ten actually decreased slightly from Generation 1 to Generation 2, while fertility

inheritance from them (Inger, 1980). Thus, sons received relatively more resources directly from fathers than did daughters. Daughters received fewer resources from their fathers, but could gain access to resources from their husbands. The fact that women's lifetime fertility and number of children surviving to age ten showed no major patterns with either father's or husband's occupational status is therefore of interest.
If the initial cohort had been structured to include women, patterns of reproduction with husband's status would have been apparent for women in the first generation. However, since men remarried more than women, and had more children in second and subsequent marriages than did women, the pattern is unlikely to have been as strong as the pattern reported here for men. The lifetime fertility of women is more limited biologically than that of men. Even the wealthiest women are constrained by menopause and the physiological costs of pregnancy and lactation. Attempts to change those costs, for example, by employing wet nurses, do not appear to have had a generally net positive effect on lifetime reproduction.
Lesthaeghe and Wilson (1986) have suggested, on the basis of a thorough analysis of the correlates of fertility in nineteenth-century Europe, that secularization of attitudes is a necessary and sometimes sufficient trigger to fertility decline. Lesthaeghe and Wilson noted that simple correlations between aggregate fertility measures and broad measures of resources are weak. Secularization seems a likely concomitant of changes in fertility, and the hypothesis is consistent with changes occurringfirstin the upper and lower ends of any occupational scale.
It is important, though, that broad

measures of resources do not adequately reflect the resource/fertility decisions of individuals. I would argue that while secularization of attitudes may be an important proximate trigger to changes in fertility (Williams, 1966), only measures that treat the variation in both resource control and fertility across populations will answer whether constriction of resources is a necessary correlate of fertility decline. The results of this study suggest that when resource differentials are great, men can use them to increase their lifetime fertility to a much greater extent than can women. When resources become constricted, reproductive differentials are likely to disappear.
Cross-culturally, a pattern is apparent of men using resources to gain reproductively, although in many societies men's increase in reproductive success is accomplished through polygyny-- additional wives. Betzig's (1986) work shows clearly that in a number of societies, there are clear, formal, reproductive rewards associated with status. High-ranking men have the right to more wives, and have significantly more children than others. In 10 of 12 societies reviewed by Hill (1984), resource control enhanced reproductive success. In some societies the relationship was quite straightforward. In the Turkmen, Irons (1979a,b) found that richer men had more wives and more children than poorer men. Borgerhoff Mulder (1988) found that in the African Kipsigis,richer men married younger wives and produced more children than poorer men, although with the introduction of Western technology and medicine, differentials were reduced. Even in societies such as the Yanomamo, in which few physical resources are owned, male kin available for coalitions represent a re-

family formation may be sex-biased (men remarry more than women, and have children in second marriages more than do women). When this occurs, the society is rendered effectively polygynous (Essock-Vitale, 1984; Daly and Wilson, 1983; Hartung, 1983). Vining (1986) has argued that these trends (richer men reproducing more than poorer men) are spurious. He and others (e.g., Wrong, 1980,1985) argue that we do not know why wealth and status differentials with reproduction exist during periods of population expansion, and why they seem to disappear when population growth stops.

Fertility shifts in humans typically involve deliberate choice about reproductive matters, and thus changes are possible in the absence of resource shifts that would be correlated for other species. In this study it is clear that deliberate choice was involved, since not only net reproduction decreased, but the rate of reproduction decreased, and women's age-specific fertility peaked much later than expected from their marriage patterns. Freedman and Thornton (1982) have shown that in the United States, families make deliberate decisions about family size in response to their judgment of available resources, and

The results of this study are suggestive. Nineteenth-century Sweden represents an extreme in the spectrum of societal constraints on people's reproductive behavior. It was highly mo-

tries in which infant mortality has always been beyond parental care impacts, but new medical technology lowers infant and child mortality, we should still see a rapid fertility rise with the introduction of medicine. Further, cultural mores and shifts in cultural values can cause shifts even if no ecological or resource correlates exist, either because of broad shifts in cultural values (Knodel, 1988; Lockridge, 1983), or because children specifically are seen as more or less valuable to parents in an economic sense (Johansson, 1987). Handwerker (1986) has argued that micro- and macro- patterns need to be reexamined. His general argument is largely correct, but I would argue that considering the ecological impacts of resource availability may give us clearer leads to the direction of causality in fertility shifts.
