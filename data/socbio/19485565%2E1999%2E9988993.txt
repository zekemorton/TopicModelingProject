ABSTRACT: Suicide data from Sweden (1911-1993) and New Zealand (1975-1995) were used to test a hypothesis derived as an extension of the Seasonal Affective Disorder concept. Contrary to the hypothesis, but similar to what Durkheim had reported regarding Central Europe in the nineteenth century, suicides peaked in late spring (May in Sweden, November in New Zealand). Durkheim's hypothesis that there would be more monthly variation in suicides in rural areas was strongly supported. Our hypothesis is that people abandon life when it is least difficult because of a disjuncture between experience and expectation.

The concept of a "seasonal affective disorder" asserts that a lack of exposure to sunlight in winter causes some people to experience feelings of depression (Lee et al., 1997). Among these people, some become severely depressed and contemplate suicide. While most depressed people do not commit suicide, the risk factor for suicide is, nonetheless, estimated to be thirty times as high for those with depression as for the general population (McDonald, 1998).
Therefore, the idea of a seasonal affective disorder clearly implies that suicides should peak sometime during the harsh winter months. As Durkheim put it, if one were to speculate without reference to social facts, one might easily surmise that the season most conducive to suicide is "when the sky is darkest and the temperature the lowest... Does not the desolate appearance of nature at such times . . . provoke melancholy? Moreover, this is the time when life is most difficult because a more abundant sustenance is necessary to replace the lack of natural

warmth, and this is harder to obtain" (1897, p. 106).
In a recent survey of undergraduate students in a social psychology course at our university, 86 per cent chose December or January when asked which month would have the largest number of suicides. The modal answer was December, chosen by 117 of the 166 respondents. Some students even made explicit reference to "S.A.D." or "Seasonal Affective Disorder," when asked to explain their estimate.
Durkheim theorized that the crucial variable was the intensity of social life rather than climatic or weather conditions. Using data from the nineteenth century for seven central European countries, Durkheim found that the summer season had the highest proportion of suicides. He reported: "Beginning with January . . . , the incidence of suicide increases regularly from month to month until about June and regularly decreases from that time to the end of the year" (1897, p. 111). Durkheim's findings, while unexpected, were not entirely new.

The Greek physician Hippocrates had observed in his anthology of truths, Aphorisms, that the common conditions of madness and melancholy were especially frequent in the spring. Contemporary authors (Maes et al., 1993; Parker and Walter, 1982) echo Hippocrates' observations inasmuch as they locate spring peaks for several types of severe anxiety and depressive disorders.
In addition, Durkheim observed that there was more variation in social life from month to month and from season to season in rural settings than in urban areas. This observation implies the hypothesis that, whenever the peak and whatever the shape of the function, there ought to be more seasonal or monthly variation in suicides in rural than in urban areas.
Although there have been some mixed results (e.g., Araki et al., 1986; Nayha, 1982; Spiers, 1972), overall the evidence is quite consistent with that reported by Durkheim (Flisher et al., 1997; Kunz and Kunz, 1997; Hassan, 1994; Lester, 1971; MacMahon, 1983; Warren, Smith and Tyler, 1983; Wenz, 1977). Massing and Angermeyer (1985), for example, found that suicide in Lower Saxony in the years 1968-77 was most likely to occur in spring and early summer and was at its minimum in winter. Chew and McCleary (1995) reported that countries with a relatively high proportion of agricultural workers had higher spring peaks in suicide than countries less dependent on agriculture. They also observed that " . . . spring peaks in suicide decline as populations urbanize, but only in the temperate middle latitudes are there significant spring peaks to begin with" (Chew and McCleary, 1995, p. 229). The latter inference is called into question by the data reported below.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The focus of this article is on suicide data from Sweden, and there are good reasons for this choice. Located far to the north with a range of 55-69 degrees north latitude, Sweden has distinctly different seasons, featuring extended daylight hours in the summer and very short days in the winter. Norway, just to the west of Sweden, has been referred to as the "best laboratory in the world" for research on seasonal affective disorder and depression (Reuters, 1997). While Sweden is situated well to the North, the bulk of its population lives at latitudes of 55-60 degrees. So we are not conducting analyses of people who live within or near the Arctic Circle. (For that type of comparison, see Bohlen, 1972.)
Sweden also has a world-wide reputation for being willing to take an objective look at its own society and for the accuracy of its statistics. Categorizing deaths as suicides is problematical; making cross-national comparisons of suicide rates, hazardous. Social scientists have expressed the view that the suicide statistics of some Catholic-dominated countries in Southern Europe may have been skewed "for heavenly purposes." Sweden, one of the more secular societies, does not have that problem. It is also an advantage that comparable data have been gathered within Sweden for a rather long time. Our analysis extends continuously across nine decades from 1911 to 1993. During these 83 years, there were 102, 102 deaths recorded as suicides in Sweden for an average of about 1,230 per year. Of these suicides, 75 per cent were committed by men and 25 per cent by women. Table 1 shows that there was relatively little variation across decades in

RESULTS
Figure 1 shows the average number of suicides per month in Sweden in the years 1911-93. These averages, adjusted to equalize the number of days per month, show the peak to occur in May with a rather symmetrical curve going downward in both directions. The average for May was 121.8, followed by June's average of 116.6. Contrary to the hypothesis implied by the seasonal affective disorder concept, the lowest average was for December with 90.9; February, January, and November, additional cold and dark months, were the other months with an average of less than 100 suicides. Despite the large differences due to gender in the number of suicides, May was the peak month for both men and women.
As might be expected, there were minor variations across decades. However, the peak month for suicides was always May (6 decades), April (2 decades), or June (1 decade). The lowest month for suicide was always December (4

decades), February (3 decades), or January (2 decades). Overall, we have 996 cases (83 years x 12 months). With the adjusted number of suicides as the dependent variable, month as an independent variable accounts for about 9 per cent of the variance (eta = 0.30). That figure, however, underestimates the strength of the relationship since a substantial portion of the variance is due to an increase in the number of suicides across years, e.g., from an average of about 832 per year in the years 1911-1919 to an average of about 1,442 in 1990-1993. When the same analysis of variance procedure was done within each decade, the eta value averaged 0.60. This finding indicates a rather robust relationship, implying that, within a decade, the month being considered can account for about 36 per cent of the variance in the number of suicides. We also tested whether month, season, or a dichotomous warm-cold period was the more relevant variable. The results indicate that dividing the calendar into twelve months accounts for more of the variance in suicides than dividing it into four seasons or two periods.
We then considered the hypothesis that monthly variation is greater in rural than

in urban areas. Between 1911 and 1955, Swedish data were available with the adjusted number of suicides for each of four combinations (gender by rural-urban). The results, given as eta squared coefficients, are shown in Table 2. Men show slightly more monthly variation in suicides than women, but the difference is relatively small and not consistent across decades.
The rural-urban difference, however, is quite large and entirely consistent across decades. That the same trend would be observed in each of five comparisons is unlikely to occur by chance (p < 0.05). For people living in rural areas away from the large cities, month accounts for more than twice as much variance in the number of suicides as for people in urban areas. The rural-urban difference is further sustained when gender is controlled (see the four right-hand columns in Table 2). In each comparison, rural men

showed more monthly variation in suicide than urban men, and rural women more than urban women. The consistency across these ten comparisons is almost certainly not due to chance (p < 0.001).
REPLICATION
Despite the strong association between month and the number of suicides in Sweden, we deemed it desirable to replicate the finding in the southern hemisphere where the seasons are the opposite from those in Sweden. Ideally, we wanted a technologically advanced nation with accurate mortality statistics that is as far south as Sweden is to the north. The nearest we could come to that standard was New Zealand. Although New Zealand is not as far south as Sweden is north, we still hypothesized that in New Zealand, suicide would peak in November which is late spring in that country.

In New Zealand in the years 1975-95, 8,421 deaths were classified as suicides. Similar to the Swedish data, in New Zealand men committed about 75 per cent of the suicides and women 25 per cent. Table 3 presents the suicide data by month for New Zealand combined across this 21-year period. The association between month and suicide is not as strong in New Zealand as it is in Sweden. Nonetheless, the observed pattern in New Zealand departs significantly from what would be expected if there were no relationship (x2 = 37.51, df = 11, p < 0.001). Moreover, the adjusted number of suicides peaks in November in New Zealand, as predicted.
DISCUSSION
In this research, we tested a logical and reasonable extension of the seasonal affective disorder concept, namely that suicides would peak in December or January due to a paucity of sunlight during these months. That hypothesis was not supported in data from either Sweden or New Zealand. While this finding in no sense disproves or eliminates the concept of a seasonal affective disorder, it does limit it. A plausible hypothesis is that the

concept remains viable and valid, but the lack of sunlight may cause no more than a mild, transitory form of depression that does not increase a person's propensity to suicide.
Our use of data from Sweden and New Zealand is quite defensible. As shown in Table 4, neither country is an outlier as to its suicide rate. Sweden's rate, while above the median, is similar to that of Germany, Belgium, and France. The suicide rate in New Zealand is similar to that of the United States or Canada.
We regard the differences between Durkheim's finding that suicide peaks in June in Central Europe and our finding that suicide peaks in May in Sweden and in November in New Zealand to be relatively minor. The point is rather the counterintuitive nature of these findings. Taken together, they beg for a sociological interpretation.
Durkheim's use of variations in the intensity of social life as a crucial factor was only partially successful. It is not clear, for example, how that factor could be operationalized directly, nor that it increases from January to June and then decreases until December in a way that corresponds with the suicide curve. Also, it is not obvious how an increase in the

intensity of social life would necessarily

yield an increase in suicide.

Durkheim asserted that there would be

more seasonal variation in social interac-

tion in rural than in urban areas. It fol-

lows, therefore, from his interpretation

''

r

that there would be more monthly vana-

tion in suicides in rural than in urban set-

tings. In that regard, Durkheim's reason-

ing was strongly corroborated by our

analysis.

However, we are still lacking an ade-

quate social explanation for why people

are prone to abandon life when it is least

difficult. Why should people decide (dis-

proportionately) to end their lives when

nature is being "reborn," when the birds

are singing and flowers are blooming?

Although we cannot prove it here, perhaps it has some connection with the relativity of human judgment. In the poet T. S. Eliot's words:
"April is the cruellest month, breeding Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing Memory and desire, stirring...."
In a different but related area of research, common sense tells us that people would be most prone to revolt when they are most deprived in objective terms, i.e., when they have "nothing left to lose." In fact, however, people are more likely to revolt following a period in which living conditions have actually been improving and expectations have been rising (Brinton, 1965; Davies, 1962). The concept of

Vol. 46,No.1-2

relative deprivation proved useful in sociological analyses that sought to explain apparent paradoxes in the American Soldier Studies (Merton, 1957; Myers, 1996). A recent analysis suggests that suicidal reactions to natural disasters, especially floods, may be delayed by a lag as large as four years--at a time when one might suppose that life would bereturning to normal and living conditions improving (Krug et al., 1998).
A relativistic theory of human happiness is grounded in people's recent experiences and their expectations (Parducci, 1968, 1984). The late spring peak in suicides may be due to a combination of what people are experiencing relative to what others appear to be enjoying and to their own high expectations (Gabennesch, 1988). Especially in ambiguous situations in which people are searching for meaning, judgments are heavily influenced by

the results of a social comparison process (Festinger, 1954). As the popular song, "Oh Lonesome Me," put it, "Everybody's going out and having fun; I'm just a fool for staying home and having none." The dynamics of this relationship could beexamined more directly in future research by comparing suicide notes written in May when suicides are most frequent with suicide notes in December when suicides areleast numerous.
