ABSTRACT: This paper examines the relationship between age at menarche and fertility from two perspectives. Age at menarche is regarded as a crude indicator of the timing of fecundity that may affect the timing of conception among those sexually active; and age at menarche is regarded as a crude indicator of the timing of sexual maturation that may influence the timing of socio-sexual behavior, namely dating and sexual intercourse. The data are drawn from a survey of New York City women who recently had their first child. The findings suggest that age at menarche as an indicator of fecundity is not a good predictor of the timing of the first birth, when controlling for age at first sexual intercourse. Looking only at initial noncontraceptors, however, we find the relationship is stronger. Age at menarche, viewed as an indicator of the timing of sexual maturation, does seem to have some influence on the timing of dating, but only for Blacks. For both races, age at first date is related to age at first sexual intercourse.

The onset of menstruation (menarche) may be considered a crude indicator of when the female' reproductive span begins. Initially, cycles tend to be relatively long and irregular, and the incidence of anovulatory cycles is high (Reymert and Jost, 1947-48; Presser, 19746). Full fecundity may not be achieved until several years later, if then. Since age at full fecundity cannot be directly assessed, it is crudely estimated by adding two or three years to age at menarche. The median age at menarche in the United States is 12.8 (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1973); thus, a reasonable guess at the median age at full fecundity is about IS.

speculation about the relationship between the two trends. Cutright (1972) has argued that the two trends are related, although his analysis focuses on trends in illegitimacy among teenagers rather than on total teenage fertility; moreover, because the data come from different sources, the direct relationship between age at menarche and teenage fertility for individuals is not examined. Our search through the literature uncovered only one study that directly examines this relationship.1 Comparing a small sample of pregnant teenagers with a control group of nonpregnant teenagers, the investigators found that those pregnant had an earlier age at menarche (Gottschalk et al., 1964).

The apparent decline in the age at menarche, estimated to be about one year per generation (Damon et al., 1969; U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1973), along with the rise in fertility among teenagers under 16 years of age (Baldwin, 1976), has led to some

1 Ryder and Westoff (1971) examined the relationship between age at menarche and fertility for married women of all parities, based on data from the 196S National Fertility Survey. Acknowledging that the analysis was undertaken "purely out of curiosity," they found that age at menarche was inversely related to pregnancy. For the first year of nonuse of contraception, those who were youngest at menarche generally had the highest pregnancy rate.

The expectation that a declining age at menarche serves to increase teenage fertility assumes that the corresponding change in fecundity among females is a critical determinant of fertility; that is, more young women are "at risk" of conceiving. This risk is relevant, however, only to young women who are sexually active. It could also be argued that age at menarche, insofar as it is related to the level of sexual maturation, may influence the timing of dating and sexual intercourse. In other words, age at menarche among those teenagers who are sexually active may affect not only the risk of conceiving, but also the timing of exposure to this risk.
In this paper, we shall consider both aspects, using data from a survey of recent mothers. First, we shall consider some of the socioeconomic correlates of age at menarche. Next, we shall examine the relationship between age at menarche and the timing of first births, controlling for the effect of age at first sexual intercourse. Age at menarche will then be examined in relation to socio-sexual behavior, spesifically age at first date and age at first sexual intercourse. Differences by race will be considered. Before exploring these relationships, we shall briefly describe the sample.
THE SAMPLE
The basic purpose of the overall study was to examine factors associated with mother's age at first birth. A sample was drawn from the birth records of women residing in the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn, the Bronx, and Queens who had their first child in July of 1970, 1971, or 1972. The sample was restricted to Black or white mothers born on the U.S. mainland who had singleton first births and were aged 15-29 at the time of their first birth.2 This age range constitutes

about 90 per cent of all first births in New York City.
A stratified random sample of women was drawn from those who met the above conditions. It included married and unmarried women of all economic statuses. A total of 541 eligible cases was located, and 408 were interviewed (75 per cent of those eligible). The interviews were conducted in person during the period January 15-March 14, 1973.3
The sample is comprised of women who have recently carried a pregnancy to term. Thus, we are looking at the process whereby age at menarche may affect the timing of the first birth for a sample of fecund women who, in their recent past (and perhaps earlier) were exposed to the risk of conception.
SOCIOECONOMIC FACTORS AND AGE
AT MENARCHE
The literature suggests that nutritional levels affect age at menarche; females with poor nutritional histories tend to have later ages at menarche (Tanner, 1968). Various indicators of socioeconomic status, which are highly related to nutrition, also seem to be associated with menarcheal age (Zacharias and Wurtman, 1969; Carfagna et al., 1972).
In our study, we may consider two background factors as indicators of socioeconomic status during early adolescence: race and the respondent's mother's education.4 We would expect that both Blacks
City sample (ages IS to 29) is 21.5-22.7 for whites and 19.0 for Blacks. This figure closely compares to the median age at first birth for the total United States (all ages) of 22.1 in 1972-22.4 for whites and 19.7 for Blacks (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1977, Table 1-13).
3 For further description of the sample, see Presser, 1974a. There have since been two follow-up interviews in 1974 and 1976, but these data are not included in the present analysis.
4 Mother's education is used rather than father's education or a combined measure of both parents because 16 per cent of the sample did not grow up with a father (real, step-, or adoptive) in the home.

before age IS are excluded from our sample.) Thus, although age at menarche may be a crude indicator of fecundity, it does not seem to differentiate the timing of the first birth for those who initiate sex at similar ages.
It may be argued that age at first sexual experience is too crude an indicator of exposure to conception and that a better test of the fecundity effect of age at menarche would be achieved if we considered only those women who were not contraceptive users. Women were asked whether they used any method of contraception at the time of first sexual intercourse; 48 per cent said no. Although most women did not conceive their first child at this time, even when they did not use contraception, we can assume that those who did not use contraception at first sexual intercourse represent a disproportionate number of subsequent irregular or noncontraceptive users.6 For this relatively high risk subgroup, does age at menarche relate to age at first birth when controlling for age at first sexual intercourse? As may be seen again in Table 4, the partial correlation for this subgroup as a whole is 0.16. The relationship is stronger for whites (0.22) than for Blacks (0.18). Thus, there is some evidence that in the absence of contraceptive use--at least at the time of first sexual experience--early age at menarche may be related to early age at first birth.
Another factor relevant to the risk of conception, in addition to contraceptive use, is the regularity of sexual intercourse. Clearly, among noncontraceptors, those who have sexual intercourse regularly generally are more at risk of conceiving than those who do not. Women were asked whether, soon after their first sexual experience, they had intercourse regularly,
6 Twenty-four per cent of women who did not use contraception at first sexual intercourse were women who at the time of first interview reported that they have never used contraception.

occasionally, or only that once. Only 37 per cent responded that it was regular.
For the high risk subgroup of women who did not use contraception the first time and had sexual intercourse regularly soon after (IS per cent of the total sample), we may ask: Is age at menarche related to age at first birth, when we control for age at first sex? As may be seen in Table 4, the answer is negative. The partial correlation for the total sample is 0.03. For whites it is much greater (0.23); for Blacks, there is a strong inverse relationship (-0.63), but this finding is based only on nine cases.
Limiting the analysis to this apparently high risk subgroup of sexually active women does not, then, strengthen the positive correlation for initial noncontraceptors between age at menarche and age at first birth when we control for age at first sexual intercourse. It may be that regular sexual activity, even for those who did not initially use contraception, is associated with regular contraceptive use; this use could offset the positive effect of age at menarche on the timing of first births.
We have thus far been considering factors associated with the risk of conception. Conception, of course, does not necessarily lead to a live birth. Fourteen per cent of the women in the sample experienced either a miscarriage or induced abortion prior to their first birth. Thus, in exploring the relevance of menarche as a fecundity variable, we need to examine the relationship between age at menarche and age at first pregnancy (including miscarriages and induced abortions). Repeating the preceding analysis for age at first pregnancy rather than age at first birth, we found the partial correlation coefficients generally were somewhat weaker (data not shown), leading us to interpretations similar to those above.7
7 It should be remembered that this is a sample of first-parity mothers and excludes women who may have been pregnant but never had a child.

The percentage is much higher for Blacks (58 per cent) than for whites (8 per cent). Even for those women who did marry prior to motherhood, most did not postpone sexuntil marriage. Fifty-one per cent reported a younger age at first sexual intercourse than at first marriage; 66 per cent for Blacks and 47 per cent for whites. For the remainder who gave identical ages for both events, some may still have experienced sex prior to marriage (anywhere up to a year before).

contraception at the time of first sex, we found the partial correlations to be stronger both for whites and Blacks. In other words, for noncontraceptive users, early menarche may increase the risk of conception and influence the timing of the first birth.
As an indicator of sexual maturation, age at menarche appears to have some influence on the timing of dating for Blacks. For both races, age at first date is correlated with age at first sexual intercourse, but this correlation is particularly strong for Blacks. Although we cannot consider the relationship between age at first sexual intercourse and age at first birth with this truncated sample, we would expect this relationship to be strong. Accordingly, at least for Blacks, age at menarche may be regarded as a determinant of socio-sexual behavior that may, in turn, influence the timing of motherhood.
This analysis suggests that attributing the increase in early adolescent fertility to the declining age at menarche requires further specification about contraceptive use and the process by which age at menarche affects socio-sexual behavior. There is a clear need for research in this area.

CONCLUSION
Our data suggest that age at menarche as an indicator of fecundity (controlling for age at first sexual intercourse) does not seem to be a good predictor of the timing of motherhood for women in general. It may be that differential contraceptive use offsets whatever effect fecundity might have as a determinant of fertility. When considering only those who did not use
