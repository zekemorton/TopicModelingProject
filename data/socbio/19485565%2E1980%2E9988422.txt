ABSTRACT: A method is presented for the analysis of deviations from random mating. Kinship, demographic, social, and spatial characteristics observed among married couples have been compared with the distributions expected if mates were chosen at random from all possible pairs of mates. This procedure has been used to investigate both failure to mate and patterns of assortative mating for cohorts born on Sanday, Orkney Islands, between 1885 and 1924. Differences in mating opportunity were observed. The 315 males who eventually married on the island differed from the 446 never-married males in birth order and sibship size as well as geographic and kinship "distances" measured between egoand all females available for marriage. Comparison of wiveswith the potential mates of married males indicated that mating was assortative with respect to kinship, demographic, social, and geographic characteristics. Further implications of this nonrandom pattern of mate choice are discussed and application of this method to other populations suggested.

Investigations in population genetics, demography, and the social sciences have shown that mate choice is an important component of population structure. Reviews of mate choice studies in each of these areas (see, for example, Jacquard, 1974; Ward and Weiss, 1976; Feeney, 1973; Eckland, 1968) indicate both the variety of methods used to study mate choice and the difficulty in generalizing from one study to another. However, assortative mating usually is defined by comparing observed characteristics of married persons with expected distributions calculated from the aggregate of all spouses of the same sex.
There are two major difficulties with this type of study. This procedure may be misleading since (1) it ignores limits imposed on the mate pool by the size and composition of the underlying population and (2) it implicitly assumes that married couples are a random sample of all pairs available for marriage. Analysis of mate choice with respect to genealogical relatedness in a number of societies indicates

that these assumptions are not necessarily valid, particularly where small population size and fluctuating vital rates limit the range of persons available for marriage (Goldberg, 1967; Dyke, 1971, Fix, 1974; Leslie et al., 1978).
A second problem common to the study of assortative mating is the question of scale. Statistically reliable results require large sample sizes; yet the number of individuals for whom detailed extensive genealogical and life history data can be gathered is limited by the size of the population of interest and by considerations of time and money required to collect and analyze such information. As pointed out by several recent reviews (Swedlund, 1978; Jorde, 1980), studies of small village populations using historic data are amenable to the acquisition of extensive information about individuals and have increasingly provided quantitative methods and results which have made it possible to investigate the life ways of common people. However, in these small populations, subdivision of the total number of married

couples into multiple categories is a risky process, making it necessary to limit the ways in which characteristics of the marriages, or of the individuals involved in them, may be investigated.
The purpose of this paper is to examine the structure of a small island population using methods which alleviate some of the effects of this dilemma. Extending a procedure originally developed by Dyke (1971), we have compared genealogical relatedness and distributions of demographic, social, and spatial characteristics observed among married couples with distributions expected if spouses were chosen randomly from all possible mates. The number of potentially marriageable couples is very large, making it possible to evaluate mating opportunity and assortative mating practices. This procedure takes into account the demographic structure of the population and does not rely on the assumption that married couples are a random sample of those eligible for marriage. In this manner, we have evaluated (1) mating opportunities with respect to success or failure to mate and (2) patterns of assortative mating in the population of Sanday, Orkney Islands, Scotland.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sanday, one of the northern Orkney islands located to the north of the mainland of Scotland, was chosen for this analysis because of its geographic and cultural isolation, the availability of standardized civil records (1855 to the present), and knowledge of its complex historic origins (Boyce et al., 1973). Typical of all of Orkney, subsistence on Sanday is based upon agriculture, supplemented by fishing and small croft industry. The influences of modernization on these outer islands has been small. Although recent agricultural innovations and home industries have introduced change into island economies

(Coull, 1966), much of daily life has changed very little since 1800. As in much of Northwestern Europe, impartible inheritance is the traditional mode of property allocation (Miller, 1976; Goldschmidt and Kunkel, 1971). There is one heir. Usually the eldest son obtains land rights, and one daughter receives a dowry. The remaining children typically do not marry or contribute offspring to the island population. They either emigrate permanently or remain in the community as landless laborers.
Decreased fertility and emigration have contributed to depopulation on Sanday, in the Highland-Island area of Scotland, and in most rural communities of Europe (Clegg, 1976, 1977; Moisley, 1966; Rundblad, 1957). For Sanday, population growth rates were positive until 1881, when maximum census size 2,175 was attained. After this period, growth rates were negative and population size decreased to 670 by 1961. Material presented elsewhere indicates that the period of maximum change occurred between 1881 and 1924 when the population decreased to 30 per cent of its maximum size and the crude birth rate decreased from 18 to 6 births per thousand population (Brennan and Boyce, 1980; Brennan, 1981). Failure to mate due to high rates of outmigration and celibacy have been observed for all cohorts born between 1855 and 1964: (1) Only 30 to 40 per cent of each cohort married; and (2) the absolute number and proportions of ever married individuals has decreased over time. Changes in mating opportunity and assortative mating could be expected to have an impact on population composition in this situation.
Dyke's (1971) analysis of marriage structure included characteristics of age and kinship as recorded in a small Caribbean isolate. In addition to these factors, we consider here birth order, sibship size,

an estimate of social distance, and geographic propinquity, since many investigations have shown the importance of these characteristics in determining the structure of human mating systems (see, for example, Adams and Kasakoff, 1974; Boyce et al., 1971; Bumpass and Mburugu, 1978; Friedman et al., 1978; Kuchemann et al., 1974; Mielke et al., 1976; Schull and MacCluer, 1968). Information for individual residents of Sanday was taken from census sources, vital records, and parish registries. Data were collected by A. J. Boyce of the University of Oxford, and E. R. Brennan. A record was assembled for each of the 1,593 individuals born from 1885 to 1924 which contained the following: calendar date and residence at each known vital event, estimated social class of father, birth order, size of sibship, and identification of all known ancestors (see Brennan and Boyce, 1980). In addition to these individual characteristics, kin relationship, difference between social classes, and distance between natal residences were computed for husbands and wives and for all opposite-sexed pairs who might have married (potential mates). A male and a female were considered to be potential mates if:
1. Both were simultaneously within reproductive age limits (males, 18-50; females, 15-40);the female wasno more than 5 years older, nor 15years younger than the male;
2. Both were unmarried at the time they were matched.
3. They were not members of the same nuclear family.
This broad definition of marital "availability" conformed quite closely to age and kinship characteristics of married couples observed in the population (Brennan, 1981) and appears to be similar to that found in other small rural populations in Western countries.

Males were chosen as the basic unit of comparison so that results would be consistent with other similar studies (Dyke, 1971; Leslie et al., 1978). Date of marriage terminated mate search for married males. A simulated "stop date," based on mean and variance in male age at first marriage for each cohort was randomly assigned to nonmaters. Each male then searched the entire female list for appropriate partners. Characteristics of a male and a given potential mate were tabulated, weighted by the number of years that the couple were available for marriage, and mean values were computed over all potential mates of that male. Values were then averaged for all males considered here (thus, variances reported in the tables are small). By comparing observed with expected values averaged for all males we have been able to evaluate marriage patterns in two ways:
1. Males who were known to have marriedon Sanday ("maters") were compared with those who did not ("nonmaters") to test the assumption that failure to mate on the island was random with respect to the characteristics listed above. Because our primary interest is whether or not an individual contributed offspring to subsequent generations, we made no distinction between celibates and emigrants in the nonmater category. In our method, both groups of males were matched with the same group of potentially marriageable women.
2. A comparison was made between wives and potential mates of married males in order to test whether mating on the island wasassortative with respect to given demographic, kinship, residence, and social class measures. For a male, if mating were random, the expected value of any of these measures in his wife can be computed from the average of that characteristic observed among all of his potential mates.
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) 2-sample, l-tailed tests with df=2 (Siegel, 1956) were used to compare observed with expected cumulative distributions for each

which is, of course, not independent of sibship size. For these reasons, we have examined the effect of sibship size and birth order on mating patterns. From Table 2 it can be seen that on the average, birth order and sibship size of male maters were less than that of nonmaters. Although not shown in the table, distributions of these characteristics indicated that maters were more likely to be first born and from small families than were nonmaters (/?<0.001). In addition, wives were of lower birth order than expected from distributions of potential mates (p<0.001).
Table 3 shows the interaction between kinship and sibship size. Male sibships were grouped into three categories: 1-3 sibs (low parental fertility), 4-6 sibs (moderate parental fertility), and 7 or more sibs (high parental fertility). Average relatedness of maters and of nonmaters and their potential mates did not differ significantly. However, for both groups, males from families of Size 4 or greater were more likely to be related to their potential mates than were males from smaller sibships (p<0.001). Table 3 indicates that grooms from large sibships married brides who were related more often than would be expected from the distribution of potential mates (p<0.001).

SOCIAL STRUCTURE
Following procedures outlined by Kuchemann et al. (1974), we have estimated social classes for individuals by converting occupation of each person's father (as listed on vital records) into one of five categories, using guidelines provided by the 1970 United Kingdom Registrar General's Classification of Occupations. The highest social class was assigned a value of 1; the lowest, 5. Table 2 indicates that maters tended to be of slightly higher social class than nonmaters. However,

none of the differences in the table are significant.
For each pair, a measure of "social distance" was computed by subtracting social class of female from social class of male. Distances were negative if the female was of a lower class than the male. Figure 1 shows the distribution of distances for (1) grooms and their brides, (2) maters and their potential mates, and (3) nonmaters and their potential mates. Differences between maters and nonmaters with respect to social distances between males and their potential mates were not significant. For a given male, most women available for marriage were from his own class (see Table 1). Homogamy with respect to social class was the norm. The highest proportion of marriages was between spouses from the same social class. There was no

consistent direction to class exogamy. However, social distance between husbands and wives was greater than expected from the distribution of potential mates (p<0.05).
Table 4 gives average relatedness of males to their wives and their potential mates by social class of males. No significant differences between maters and nonmaters were observed with respect to the distribution of relatives by social class. Although there were differences in relatedness between maters and nonmaters, these differences were not a function of social class. For both groups, however, lower class males (Classes 4 and 5) were more closely related to potential mates than were males from higher social classes (p<0.05). In addition, a pattern of assortative mating was observed. Grooms were more closely related

GEOGRAPHIC STRUCTURE
The relationship between geographic structure and mate choice was measured using linear distances between birth places of members of each pair. Vital records defined exact location of dwelling at birth for approximately 94 per cent of the sample. Distances between males and their wives and potential mates are shown in Table 1 and Figure 3 (distances, shown as midpoints of 10 km. intervals, were truncated at 90 km.). Distance played a part in mate choice in several ways: (1) Maters were born further away (about 10 km.) from their potential mates than were nonmaters (p<0.001). (2) The proportion of marriages between individuals born on the island (less than 30 km. apart) was greater than expected from the distribution of potential mates (p<0.001). Typically, spouses born off-island came from

larger urban populations such as Kirkwall, the county capítol, 35 km. away, and Edinburgh, more than 90 km. to the south, rather than from closer small island populations.
Figure 4shows the interaction of spatial distance and relatedness. For pairs born both on- and off-island, nonmaters were more closely related to potential mates than were maters (p<0.05). Consanguinity of spouses was higher than expected at very short distances (p<0.001), that is, where both spouses had been born on the island.
DISCUSSION
FAILURE TO MATE
Comparison of maters with nonmaters reveals that the two groups of males differed in all characteristics except social class.

Failure to mate which was nonrandom with respect to kinship resulted in a pattern of consanguinity avoidance. Among cohorts born during the time examined, nonmaters were more closely related to their potential mates than were maters, implying that the proportions of relatives among one's potential mates may play a part in determining whether or not to marry endogamously. Although not presented here, this trend is consistent from about 1800 to 1950 in the Sanday population and has been observed in other small populations. The magnitude of this effect is small, but over time this "avoidance" pattern will reduce the effectiveness of random inbreeding, and it temporarily maintains levels of heterozygosity at higher levels than would be expected if nonmating were random with respect to kinship. Leslie et al. (1978,1980) have ob-

served this trend and have presented an analysis of this phenomenon for two other small populations of European origin in the West Indies. Brennan et al. (ms.) have applied the Leslie model to the Sanday population at two different time periods and have found that the pattern described here holds for periods prior to 1950, but is reversed after 1950 (that is, in the most recent period maters are more closely related to their potential mates than are nonmaters).
Maters were of lower birth order and from smaller sibships than were nonmaters. This pattern appears to be associated with impartible inheritance, the traditional means of allocating property in Northwestern Europe (see, for example, Goody, 1976; Kennedy, 1973). One consequence of this system is that ideally only two children, one male and one female,

can expect to remain and marry within the community. Thus, the eldest male from a small family with few competing sibs would have the best chances for obtaining land rights and marrying within the population.
Differences between maters and nonmaters are small with respect to the distribution of distances to birth places of their potential mates. Although these distances tended to be closer for nonmaters than for maters, it is quite likely that this is an indirect effect, related to the avoidance of consanguinity described above. Relatives tend to live nearby, and since nonmaters have more relatives among their potential mates the distribution of their distances is skewed accordingly.
ASSORTATIVE MATING
Comparison of wives with the potential mates of married males shows positive assortative mating for demographic characteristics and for geographical distance insofar as it is related to kinship. Males of lower birth order and from smaller sibships married females with similar characteristics more often than would be expected. On the average, males married relatives born closer to them than would have been expected from the distribution of average distances separating them from their potential mates. These patterns too may be related to inheritance of property. First-borns typically have a greater chance to inherit land rights (or a dowry) and thus increased chances for marriage within the population. It also appears that islandborn individuals can increase their access to farmland if they marry endogamously.
Negative assortative mating, in which differences between spouses were greater than expected from random choice of partners from potential mates, was observed for social class, and for distances between birthplaces of all married residents of the island. The highest frequency

of marriages occurred within a given social class. Social homogamy has been reported for other populations (Kerchkogg, 1978; Udry, 1971) and has been cited as evidence of positive assortative mating with respect to social class. However, this study has shown that the proportion of withinclass marriages is less frequent than would be expected from the distribution of potential mates of married males. Although not shown here, this high frequency of marriages between persons in adjacent social classes was a consistent pattern for cohorts born between 1855 and 1964 and may be indicative of the fluidity of class boundaries in West European populations (see, for example, Kuchemann et al., 1974). The relatively high frequency of marriages with individuals born off-island is evidence of a pattern of isolate breakdown, detectable as early as the late nineteenth century and continuing today. It appears that population size, density, and neighborhood knowledge are all important factors influencing off-island mate choice.
CONCLUSIONS
In spite of limitations typical of historical studies of population structure, such as gaps and inconsistencies in the recording of names and dates and uneven genealogical depth, we have been able to make a quantitative assessment of the relationship between mate choice and population structure. Data of the type used here are frequently available from church and civil registries, so that our methods are replicable in other populations and could be used with variables other than those included here, such as income or biométrie traits. Given the quantity of data required for each individual and the large number of comparisons which must be made between potential couples, these methods are probably not practicable with large
