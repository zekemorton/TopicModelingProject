The effects of age at first marriage (AGEMAR) and final parity (PARITY), treated as quantitative variables, were controlled for since they are known to be associated with the response variable.

For the sake of simplicity, marital disruption was considered only for the first marriage, and a first union was defined as dissolved if a woman said that she was divorced, widowed, or separated.

Spearman correlation coefficients for the independent variables (Table 2) indicate low correlation among them, except for marital experience (-0.62). But since this degree of correlation is only

Since the measurement of reproductive span is more accurate for women in the oldest cohort (age 45-49), a multiple regression model for the 830 women in this group only was developed. The model fitted for the i-th woman in the data set is
RSPANi = po + Pi AGEMAR,- + p2 PARITY, + p3 WYRSED; + RESI-
DENCE,- + PsMARl,- + p6 MAR2, + RESIDUAL,.
Examination of plots of residuals from the fitted model suggested no violation of the assumptions underlying regression analysis.
RESULTS
The estimated regression surface obtained is
RSPAN = 11.255 - 0.306 AGEMAR + 1.326 PARITY - 0.107
WYRSED + 0.389 RESIDENCE + 0.243 MAR1 + 1.465 MAR2.
Table 3 gives other results from the fitted regression. The F-value attests

that there is a regression relation between the dependent and independent variables. The R2 value indicates that 57 per cent of the variation in reproductive span is accounted for by the set of independent variables in the model.
Since alternatives to the null hypotheses are one-sided, one-sided /^-values were computed for testing the individual hypothesis that p,- = 0. (Thesep-values, based on the /-statistic, bJS{b^, provide marginal tests. There are no inferences made about the joint significance of the coefficients.) When all other variables in the model were controlled, wife's years of schooling had a negative effect on the length of the reproductive span, significant at the 0.05 level. An increase of one year of education was associated with a decrease of 0.11 of a year in mean reproductive span.
Current residence in rural areas was associated with longer spans of childbearing than the overall span, while residence in urban regions had the reverse effect. Rural residence was associated with a mean span of about 0.39 of a year longer than the overall average, and urban residence, 0.39 of a year shorter.

Women whose first marriages were still intact tended to have reproductive spans not significantly different from the overall mean (p-value = 0.1282). This result is expected since the vast majority of the women belonged to this group. Those with dissolved marriages who had remarried had the longest spans of all-- about 1.5 years longer than the overall mean span. The corresponding statistics were calculated for the omitted category, i.e., those with dissolved first unions who had not remarried by the time of the interview. These women had spans of about 1.7 years shorter than the overall average. These findings imply that the marriages which had dissolved without remarriage tended to do so before the women had completed the childbearing period, and that women who remarried were inclined to produce children from their new unions.
Reproductive span tended to decrease as age at first marriage increased. An increase of one year in age at marriage was associated with a reduction of about 0.31 of a year in mean length of the reproductive span.
Longer spans were associated with higher parity. Each additional child extended the mean reproductive span an average of 1.33 years. Since a birth interval must be at least 0.75 of a year (for full-term births), this small change in length of the span manifests a predominant lack of birth spacing among Egyptian women.
CONCLUSIONS
Results of the present study show long reproductive spans to be associated with low levels of women's education, residence in rural areas, remarriage after being divorced or widowed, early age at marriage, and high parity. Effects

of these variables are statistically significant, although the magnitudes of some effects appear to be small demographically.
It will be remembered, however, that the analysis was done only on women aged 45 to 49 in Egypt in 1980. These women began reproducing at a time when birth rates were relatively high because of the post-World War II Baby Boom, and differences in fertility between urban and rural areas were small. The housing shortage, increased status of women, etc., in urban areas of Egypt in recent years can be expected to manifest themselves by increasing the effects of the independent variables on the length of the reproductive span for younger cohorts of women.
This widening of the effect of residence, for example, is observed in regard to age at first birth (not shown), which, it will be recalled, is a component of the length of reproductive span. While percentage distributions of age at first birth between urban and rural women aged 45 to 49 (^5 = 3.38) are not significantly different, for women aged 25 to 29 the percentage having first birth at an early age is significantly lower among urban women (X2^ = 75.49) (Home and Suchindran, 1985).
An increase in the magnitude of the effect of education also can be expected for younger cohorts of women, as similar mechanisms causing the divergency by residence also should widen the differences by education. Bulatao (1984,p. 16) reports that on a worldwide basis, and in Egypt in particular, "the differentials in fertility between education groups increase . . . as fertility transition progresses."
Thus, results of the present analysis on Egyptian women aged 45 to 49, which are statistically significant, are ex-

pected to become even more so for younger cohorts of Egyptian women.
Since the analysis reveals that longer reproductive spans are associated with higher final parity--a result that is not tautological, as this positive association is not always found in developed countries with a high degree of contraceptive use and deliberate birth spacing (Suchindran et. al., 1985)--the implication is that in addition to the widely proposed raising of the legal age at marriage, a lowering of the age at last birth, and thereby a shortening of the reproductive span from the upper end, also can be encouraged while not legislated, in order to reduce fertility in high fertility countries. Information/education campaigns can effectively broadcast the health, social, and demographic disadvantages of bearing children at old maternal ages (Fortney et al., 1982; Omran and Johnston, 1984;Younis et al., 1979). In 1982, 21 per cent of all live births in Egypt

were born to women aged 35 and older, and of these births 79per cent were birth orders 4 and over (United Nations, 1988). Thus, reducing the percentage of births to women over age 35 can have a significant impact in reducing population growth and maternal and infant mortality rates.
Since the magnitude of the effect of education is anticipated to increase among younger cohorts of women, policies designed to increase educational opportunities for women are expected to reduce the length of the reproductive span. But, as the results for the cohort age 45-49 show that increasing education from none to nine years of schooling reduced the reproductive span, on average, by about one year, and as Bulatao (1984) suggests, increasing women's education to at least the secondary level may be required to have significant impacts of fertility.
