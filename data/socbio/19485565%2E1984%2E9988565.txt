ABSTRACT: The proportion of persons of a given racial/ethnic group in the population seems likely to influence the probability that members of that group marry persons of other racial/ ethnic groups, while median income does not. However, among individuals who do marry crossethnically, the median income levels of other groups has a substantial association with the probability of occurrence of difference possible combinations of cross-ethnic matings.

Marriage generally involves "like marries like"--homogamous assortative mating. Homogamy tends to be very substantial for age and for race, relatively strong for such attributes as parental educational and occupational status, one's own educational and occupa-

Cross-racial/ethnic matings are of interest since they run counter to the very general tendency toward homogany. While they are increasing on the U.S. mainland, they still are only about one per cent of all matings of white, black, and "other nonwhite" groups (the thoroughly inadequate system of categorization used in the 1970 U.S. census; see Reiss, 1980, p. 333). Data from the 1980 census still are unavailable1. In Hawaii, the proportion of out-marriage has been very high ever since the discovery of the islands by non-Polynesians. It has been

Additional smaller groups listed separately in State of Hawaii population data include Puerto Ricans, Koreans, Samoans, Blacks, and Vietnamese. Given this diversity, it is far more likely for a Hawaii resident to meet, fall in love with, and marry someone of another group than it would be for someone in most other regions to do so. Further, these groups vary less in socioeconomic status or in prestige than probably in the case

The purpose of the present paper is to further analyze already published data in order to assess the associations of ethnic group size and of median ethnic group income with per cents of crossethnic marriages and, among crossethnic marriages, per cents of the different combinations of marriages of each of the five major racial/ethnic groups in Hawaii. The analysis provides information regarding possible bases of differential within/across group mating as well as the bases of differential cross-group matings to members of various racial/ ethnic groups.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Analyses presented herein have to do with marriages occurring in the years 1975-77, the most recent years (so far as the writer can ascertain) for which both marriage and income data are available in sufficient detail to permit the analyses to be done. Data are from Lind concerning group size (1980, p. 30), median group income (1980, p. 106), and marriage (1980, p. 116).
These analyses are limited to the five largest racial/ethnic groups, persons of Caucasian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, and Hawaiian/Part Hawaiian ancestries. Lind also included data regarding other, smaller racial/ethnic groups. These data are not used in the analyses since the groups are quite small; the largest, persons of Korean ancestry, formed 1.2 per cent of the 1975-77 population.
Several problems exist with regard to these data. Population figures are for all members of each group, not just those persons of marriageable age, and this clearly introduces some error. A more major problem has to do with the actual numbers of members of each group reported. These data have to do with resi-

dent and also nonresident marriages. There is a large military presence in Hawaii. There were about fifty thousand military personnel plus over sixty thousand military dependents in 1970 (see Lind, p. 9 and p. 30); these numbers almost certainly were as high or higher in the years 1975-77 that form the basis of the present analysis. In addition, between two and three million tourists visited Hawaii each year during this time period. The vast majority of the military, military dependents, and tourists are of Caucasian ancestry. While tourists (nonresidents) and persons living in military barracks are not included in the population figures shown below, military and their dependents living in the community are included, thus inflating the proportion of Caucasians in the population. All marriages are included, thus further inflating the proportions of Caucasians as compared to members of other groups getting married.
Since persons of Caucasian and of Japanese ancestry are close to equal in numbers of residents not living in barracks, but the number of Caucasians marrying is about three times as large (see Table 1 below), it seems clear that short-time residents or visitors of Caucasian ancestry make up the majority of Caucasian marriages. These would seem likely to be the persons least likely to marry across racial/ethnic groups. The frequency of marriage would be sharply reduced and the rate of crossgroup marriage of Caucasians increased if marriage data had only to do with only relatively permanent residents of Hawaii. Schwertfeger (1982, p. 53), studying marriages of only Hawaii civilian residents married in 1968, found that 48.3 per cent of Caucasian women and 47.2 per cent of Caucasian men married persons of other ethnic groups. The

present data are badly flawed with regard to the proportion of cross-ethnic matings of Caucasian residents; even so, the relative frequencies of different kinds of cross-ethnic matings of Caucasians with others is of major interest. In this respect (as will be seen below) the Caucasian data are consonant with those of other groups.
RESULTS Ingroup vs. outgroup marriage data are presented in Table 1 separately, by ethnicity, for males and for females,

Groups are ordered in terms of median income, from Chinese (highest) to Hawaiian/Part Hawaiian (lowest),
This is a closed system, since it addresses only within-group matings and matings to members of the four other groups. The total number of withingroup marriages is 17,388, and the total number of outmarriages of persons of those five groups to members of the other four groups is 8,286, for both males and for females. However, the numbers of males and of females of any group marrying persons of any other group vary. Therefore, analyses pre-

Tables 2 and 3 deal only with persons marrying outside of their own racial/ ethnic groups. Five data entries are presented for each combination of grooms/ brides (Table 2) and of brides/grooms (Table 3). These are: (1) number of outmarriages to a specific group; (2) per cent of outmarriages to a specific outgroup of all outmarriages; (3) per cent of that group in the population of the four outmarriage groups assessed herein; (4)

differences in per cents of outmarriage to members of the four outmarriage groups and per cents in the population of the four outmarriage groups; and (5) per cent over- or under-representation; per cent marriage (No. 2 above) divided by per cent in outmarriage population (No. 3 above).

greatly reduced as a result of the uncertain but probably large number of within-group marriages of military persons, their dependents, and of visitors to Hawaii included in the Caucasian marriage group. However, this unavoidable problem should not greatly influence the differential outmarriage rates of the Caucasians to members of the four other groups. Table 1 indicates that probability of outmarriage is not consistently related to group income; Chinese (highest median income) and persons of Hawaiian/Part Hawaiian ancestry (lowest median income) show the highest percentages of outmarriage. The number of persons making up given groups does seem to play a role; larger groups have lower outmarriage rates. Since 19 of 20 potential marriage partners a person of Chinese ancestry meets are of another racial/ethnic group, as compared with about 2 in 3 for persons

of Caucasian or of Japanese ancestry, it is not surprising that the Chinese outmarry more often. As may be discerned in Tables 2,3, and 4, who marries whom appears to be closely associated with group income level; outmarriages to members of groups similar to one's own in income are over-represented and to dissimilar income groups underrepresented, with this tendency somewhat greater for women than men.
An East-West split into intergroup marriage has been suggested to exist (Parkman and Sawyer, 1967), with persons of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean ancestries on the one hand, and persons of Caucasian, Hawaiian/Part Hawaiian, Filipino, and Puerto Rican ancestries on the other hand, tending to intermarry. Data having to do with persons of Korean or of Puerto Rican ancestry are not included herein because the groups are so small in numbers (10,136 Koreans

and 4,695 Puerto Ricans in 1977; Lind, 1980, p. 30). Data presented herein are somewhat supportive of an East-West split, since there is a substantial overrepresentation of Chinese-Japanese intermarriage, and an underrepresentation of marriages of Japanese men and Caucasian women. However, marriages of Caucasian grooms with brides of Chinese ancestry also are overrepresented. If a true East-West split existed as a result of cultural affinities, one would expect Filipinos to be more like persons of Asian as opposed to nonAsian ancestry in terms of marriage patterns, but they are not. In fact, in the Parkman and Sawyer analysis Filipinos and Puerto Ricans are more representative of the West than are Caucasians. Further, one would expect this supposed cultural affinity to be equally present for both sexes, while the data show substantial sex differences in marriage patterns. One can wonder, too, about the actual cultural affinity of persons of Asian ancestry; culturally denned sex roles probably vary more between Chinese and Japanese than between either of these groups and Cauca-

sians. Finally, it should be noted, that the rank order correlation between "Eastern-ness" and group income for the seven groups (with Hawaiians and Part-Hawaiians combined in this correlation) studied by Parkman and Sawyer is 0.75.
Obviously, ability to delay gratification, self-discipline, and placing a high value on education are themselves cultural variables and would be expected to differ between groups varying in achievement. On this level, one would expect cultural differences between groups to be reflected in income levels and expect that groups of similar income levels more often have shared values than groups dissimilar in income. Differences in income do not exist in a vacuum, and it seems probable that the cultural attributes likely to lead to a given level of income, rather than income per se, influences the probability of persons marrying members of given racial/ethnic groups other than their own. Group income reflects many other attributes of groups; however, group income in its own right is a good predictor of patterns of inter-racial/ethnic marriage.
