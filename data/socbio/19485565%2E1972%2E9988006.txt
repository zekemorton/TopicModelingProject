The Eugenic Hypothesis was formulated at the end of the Great Depression, in the late 193O's. It was a forecast of what might happen in the kind of society toward which the United States then seemed to be moving, namely, an improved social environment in which extreme poverty, ill health, and ignorance would be much diminished; in which effective methods of birth control were universally available and accepted; and a society in which the psychological and cultural atmosphere would tend to encourage births among the parents most responsive to the possibilities of their environment and diminish births among the least responsive (Osborn, 1940). The Hypothesis proposed that in such a society group differences in births would level off; there would be wide variations in fertility between individuals within each group; the distribution of births would favor those individual family lines, within each economic, occupational and social group, whose genetic potentials were most appropriate to their particular environment; and by a wholly voluntary and unconscious process of birth selection, the individual's success in his environment would tend to bring about the increase of his family line, births taking the place of deaths as the major factor in selection.
We are far from having reached such a

form of society. But since the 1930's we have been moving toward it, with improvements in the physical and educational environment, wider and more effective use of birth control, and more freedom in the choice of jobs and mates. The Eugenic Hypothesis can now be reviewed in the light of recent studies on the distribution of births and a new analysis of their genetic significance.
In early colonial days, births were close to the biological limit, averaging about 8 children per married woman. As conditions improved, the birth rate declined; but the decennial increase in the population of the United States remained fairly constant for the two hundred years from 1660 to 1860, at a rate of increase between 30 and 40% each ten years, sufficient to double the population every generation. For the decade ending in 1860, the rate of increase was 35.4%; it fell in 1870 to 26.7%; it went down to 26% in 1880, and to 25% in 1890, to 20.7% by 1900, and on down to 14.8% for the decade ending in 1930. Finally by 1940, it had dropped to 7.2% (National Resources Committee, 1938, 1935-40). Native white women 40 to 45 years of age, enumerated in the census of 1940, had borne an average of 1.68 children if they lived in cities of over 250,000, a rate far below replacement; and only the

high rate of women on the farm, an average of 3.67, lifted the group above the number necessary for the replacement of its population in the next generation (Grabill, Kiser, and Whelpton, 1958, p. 88).
Differences in fertility between occupational groups were as great as those between the urban and rural groups. In 1940, white married women 40 to 45 years old, when married to professional, technical, and similar workers, had had an average of 1.9 children, as against an average of 3.4 children for the wives of noafarm workers, and 4.2 for the wives of farm workers and foremen. The corresponding figures for 1910 had been an average of 2.75 children for the wives of professional men and 4.6 and 4.97 respectively for the wives of nonfarm laborers and of farm laborers (Grabill et al., 1958, p. 131). There was nothing in the 1940 figures to indicate that differences in fertility between large occupational or social groups would soon disappear. But it was evident that the use and effectiveness of birth control was spreading rapidly through the population, and that this trend was being hastened by the movement of people from the farm to the cities. If birth control became increasingly used and effective, and the rural migration to the cities continued, we might expect to see a great reduction in group differences in fertility in the United States.
Such a change had already begun abroad. During 1919-22, in the city of Stockholm, couples in what we would call the whitecollar classes had standardized fertility rates of 104 and 110 when their incomes were under 4,000 kronen, and the size of their families rose with each increase in income to a standardized fertility rate of 154 at incomes of 10,000 kronen and over (Edin and Hutchinson, 1935, p. 59). Here was an urban population in a city where the effective use of birth control was almost universal, and the old differentials at differ-

ent levels of income had not only disappeared, they had been reversed.
Trends in individual differences in fertility within social groups were less well documented. Minor studies had been made in the United States on the relation of fertility to "success" among graduates of Harvard, of Yale, and of Princeton, reported for the first two in 1927 and for Princeton in 1939. In the Harvard and Yale studies, "success" was determined by the judgment of classmates; in the Princeton study, only the businessmen were rated, and the rating was based on their financial success. For these alumni of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, the most successful men averaged about two children per graduate, and the least successful less than half that number. In all three cases, 93% of the most successful men were married; but among the least successful only 58% to 66% were married (Osborn, 1951, summary and comparison). Differences in proportion married were to figure prominently in later studies. The numbers involved in these early studies were too small and the methodology inadequate. They provided some clues for what might be future trends, but the bases for the Eugenic Hypothesis were highly speculative at the time of its formulation in 1940.
Since 1940 there have been great changes in the American environment as it affects fertility. New methods, particularly the pill and the intrauterine devices, have made contraception far more effective. The study made on white Protestant wives in the city of Indianapolis in 1941 provides an interesting comparison with the contraceptive usage of white Protestant wives in the United States in 1965. In 1941 the Indianapolis wives did not use the pill; there were no pills available. But by 1965, the pill, probably the most effective known method of contraception, was used by 30% of white Protestant wives in the United

States. The douche, the least effective method next to the safe period, was used by 35% of white wives in Indianapolis in 1941, and by only 7% of all white wives in 1965 (Westoff, Herrera and Whelpton, 1953; Westoff and Ryder, 1969, p. 1311).
Along with an increase in effectiveness, the general use of contraceptives increased markedly after 1940. It is estimated that in 1940 some 40% of married women in the United States used some form of contraception. In 1955, 70% of white wives reported the use of some form of contraception, and the number rose to 84% in 1965 (Westoff and Ryder, 1969, p. 1311).
The legalization of abortion which began to take place in the United States during the 1960's seems to be having far reaching and sudden effect in areas where abortion services are provided, not only in reducing the birth rate, but also in reducing social and economic differentials in births. The change has been so recent that few figures are available. But in New York State, where the most liberal abortion laws became effective in July, 1970, and particularly in New York City, where the major hospitals now perform free abortions, there has been a sharp drop in the birth rate, especially in the low income, low education groups (see recent study by Pakter and Nelson, 1971). There has also been an increase in sterilization. In 1955, among white couples, 4% of either husband or wife reported they had been sterilized. In 1960 the figure was 5.6%; and in 1970, 10.5% (Westoff and Ryder, 1971, p. 131).
Not only has the use and effectiveness of various methods of controlling births spread through the least educated groups in the United States, but since 1940 these groups have diminished in size and in proportion to the rest of the population. In 1940, 24% of the people aged 25 or over had had four or more years of high school; in 1969, over half the population aged 25

or more was at least a high school graduate; and 10.7% had had four or more years of college. Taking nonwhites alone, the change is even more significant. Seven and one-half per cent of the nonwhites aged 25 or more had had four years or more of high school by 1940; but by 1969 the figure was 34.6%; and while only 1.3% of these adult nonwhites had had four or more years of college in 1940, the figure had risen to 6.1% in 1969, almost a five-fold increase (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1960, Table 76; 1963, Tables 1, 2, 3; 1970a, Table 1). There has always been a positive correlation between effective control of births and educational level. The present trends in education would seem to indicate an increasing proportion of couples conditioned to effective use of birth control.
Poverty and lack of medical care restrict the use of contraception. The median income of white families in the United States has increased from $5,194 in 1947 to $9,794 in 1969, and of nonwhite families from $2,660 in 1947 to $6,191 in 1969 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 19705, p. 23; U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1970). National health expenditures have increased from some twelve billion a year in 1950 to over sixty billion a year in 1969 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 19705, Table 78). The proportion of consumer expenditures spent on food has diminished, indicating a larger margin for other goods (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1964a, b).
The Eugenic Hypothesis as it was originally formulated, proposed not only a general improvement in the environment with emphasis on the spread of birth control, but it was also thought to require the "introduction of eugenic measures of a psychological and cultural sort which will tend to encourage births among parents most responsive to the possibilities of their environment" (Osborn, 1940, p. 198). There has been no conscious introduction of such

measures in the thirty years since 1940, with the exception of heredity clinics which relate to genetic defects and include only a small fraction of the population. It seems possible that the cultural changes now going on, though being made for quite other than eugenic reasons, may be not unfavorable to a eugenic distribution of births.
In the thirty years since 1940 the United States has gone far toward fulfilling the expectations of environmental change forecast in the Eugenic Hypothesis. There has been a great increase in the use and effectiveness of methods for controlling births. We have moved nearer to the equalization of educational opportunity; for most of our people there has been an improvement in nutrition and health care, and a smaller proportion at or below the level of poverty. There are increased opportunities for finding jobs appropriate to individual interests and capacities. Because of increased educational and job mobility, assortative mating, which was not considered when the Eugenic Hypothesis was formulated, should be on the increase. When combined with differences in fertility, it can be an important factor in selection.
Largely as a result of these changes in the American environment, the distribution of births today is very different from that at the end of the Depression of the 1930's. In 1940, the fertility of women on farms and in small towns was far above that needed for replacement, and that of women in urban centers far below replacement, though there were an unsuspected number of delayed births and marriages in the offing. Group differentials in births were at their greatest divergence, with no sign of diminishing. Today the post-war baby boom is about at an end, and we appear to be moving toward a stabilized population, with birth rates at replacement or even below, while group differences in fertility have moved to a low level and may even be

reversed (1970 Nati. Fertility Study and surveys by the U.S. Bureau of the Census and the National Center for Health Statistics reported in advance summaries in the New York Times, November 5, 1971). Both of these changes have important implications for the Eugenic Hypothesis.
There is evidence that low birth rates at or about the replacement level, with or without a lowering of group differentials, may provide greater opportunities for selection than did the universally high birth rates of the past. In material prepared by Crow and quoted and summarized by Dobzhansky, women born in the United States in 1839, when the population was largely rural and the birth rate high, had an index of opportunity for selection due to variations in fertility of 0.23, while for women alive in the United States in 1950, when the population was more largely urban and the birth rate lower, the index of opportunity for selection due to variations in fertility was 1.4 (Dobzhansky, 1962, p. 160). Part of these large differences may be due to group differences in the use of birth control still existing at that time. And of course the index of opportunity for selection does not tell us what if any selection is actually going on. That will have to be determined by later specific studies. But it is important that there may be large opportunities for selection in the low birth rate societies which are envisaged for the future. There is never going to be a society in which each and every woman has 2.2 children, or whatever the number necessary for replacement. There will always be women, perhaps 30 or 40% or more of the whole, who will have no children or only one child, and there will always be a substantial proportion who will have four or five children or more, allowing large opportunities for selection through variations in fertility of individuals. Even at the end of the Great Depression in 1941, when the birth rate in the

United States had reached its lowest point, when women married to high school graduates did not have enough children to replace their own number and college graduates had only 75% of the number required for replacement, there were still a substantial number of women in these groups who had large families. In Indianapolis in 1940, among white Protestant women whose average fertility was below replacement, of those who were married to college graduates, 9% had four or more children; of those who were married to high school graduates, 13.6% had four children or more (Whelpton and Kiser, 1944, p. 80). The opportunity for selection could thus be higher in the low-birth-rate, low-death-rate societies of the future than it was in the high-birth-rate, high-death-rate societies of the past.
Also important to the consideration of the Eugenic Hypothesis is the reduction of group differences in fertility which is now taking place. The equalization of group fertility rates removes an element of controversy which has in the past beclouded the study of changes in gene frequencies. Some geneticists, psychologists, and sociologists have held that there are ascertained differences in genetic capacity for the development of intelligence as between the average of different social, racial, educational, and economic groups in the United States-- a view disputed by others. Discussion of this question is inevitably tinged with a partisan bias which makes for controversy, especially when it is linked with wide variations in group fertility. When group differences in fertility level off as they are now doing, the evolutionary aspects of group differences become less important and the greater importance must be given to fertility differentials between individuals and family stocks within each of the various groups. Even if it ever becomes possible to determine the frequency of genes and gene

constellations related to intelligence in the various groupings of the population, it seems certain that there will be a heavy overlap.
It is generally accepted that individuals differ greatly in their genetic endowments. The extent of these differences have been studied and reported on. We know that differences between individuals within any group of the population are far greater than are genetic differences between the averages of any of the groups, and differences in the fertility of individuals must therefore be far more important to changes in the frequency and distribution of genes than are differences in the average fertility of groups. There can be little doubt that today natural selection operates mainly through the differential fertility of individual couples, and it is this kind of selection with which the Eugenic Hypothesis is concerned.
The earliest attempts to quantitatively estimate the direction and intensity of natural selection in relation to individual differences in intelligence (as measured by IQ tests) involved ascertaining the relationship between the IQ test performance of school children and the size of the families from which these children came, that is to say, the size of the families of origin. These studies (for example, Cattell, 1937; Burt, 1946) consistently found the correlation coefficient between IQ and size of family of origin to be negative, ranging from --0.12 to --0.46 with the median of the studies at --0.25 (Waller, 1969). The consistent finding of a negative relationship between IQ and size of family of origin coupled with data from census reports and other studies which found inverse relationships between fertility and such factors as socioeconomic class, education, and income led many demographers and geneticists to believe that such patterns of births were an inevitable concomitant of the industrial welfare state society and would lead to the

genetic deterioration of human populations living in these societies.
During the 1940's and early 195O's several studies were made in Sweden (Moberg, 1950; Quensel, 1957) and in the United States (Willoughby and Coogan, 1940) which related the IQ test score of an individual to his (or her) subsequent fertility while the individual was in the middle of his (or her) reproductive years. The findings of these studies not only did not clearly indicate a definite negative relationship between the IQ of an individual and his (or her) subsequent fertility at approximately age 30 but also seriously questioned the validity of using the number of siblings (size of family of origin) an individual has to estimate the relationship between IQ and fertility.
Three studies of the direction and intensity of natural selection in relation to human intelligence as measured by IQ which were based on the subsequent completed fertility of the tested individual were conducted in different regions of the United States during the 1960's: the Minnesota Mental Retardation Study carried out by Reed and Reed (1965) and updated and reanalyzed by Waller (1971) ; the Kalamazoo Fertility Study carried out by Bajema (1963,1966,1968) ; andtheThird Harvard

Growth Study carried out by Bajema (1971, ms.). These three studies are based on samples of individuals given IQ tests as school children, whoconstituted a cohort of Americans born between 1912 and 1928, and who are quite representative of many American populations born during this period of time. The Kalamazoo Fertility Study and the Third Harvard Growth Study were based on white native-born urban Americans who were raised in urban environments, while the Minnesota Mental Retardation Study sample was based on white native-born Americans, some of whom were raised in urban environments and some of whom were raised in rural environments.
The traditional negative correlation coefficient between the IQ of an individual and the number of his (or her) siblings was observed in all three of these American studies (see Table 1). But in the same studies, the correlation coefficient between the IQ of an individual and his (or her) subsequent completed fertility was slightly positive (see Table 1). It is interesting to note that in all three studies the individuals with the highest IQ's (IQ > 130) produced more offspring, on the average, than individuals with lower IQ's (see Table 2). The very small yet positive relationship

between IQ and subsequent completed fertility observed in these three quite representative American populations (consisting of individuals who were native-born, white, and primarily urban in upbringing and residence) indicates that natural selection was operating in these populations to bring about a slight increase in the frequency of genes which, interacting with the environment, bring about the development of above-average intelligence.
Few studies of the relationship between the IQ of an individual and his subsequent completed fertility have been conducted in Europe. A pilot study of the relationship between social mobility and fertility among residents of Cambridge, England, found a small but positive relationship between IQ and family size (Gibson and Young, 1965).

cupation are disappearing in Western European countries, and in some cases the fertility differentials are becoming positive, Thus, what little evidence that is available from Europe indicates that reproductive patterns in relation to human intelligence are probably changing in the direction predieted by the Eugenic Hypothesis,
The consistent finding of a negative relationship between the IQ's of individuals and the number of their siblings coupled with the consistent finding of a positive relationship between the IQ's of the same individuals and their subsequent completed fertility in all three previously mentioned American studies emphasizes three important demographic facts that individuals studying differential fertility need to be aware of.

A follow-up study of the 1932 Scottish First, any study of differential fertility Council of Education Survey was carried which uses only the number of siblings of out by Maxwell in 1969. When the non- the individuals studied to estimate the married individuals in the Scottish study direction and intensity of natural selection are included in ascertaining fertility, the omits the nonreproductive proportion of 90-109 IQ group which encompasses the the population and may lead to erroneous mean had the highest reproductive fitness conclusions. The nonreproductive group (see reanalysis by Waller, 1969). Tobah may comprise up to 20% or more of the (1971) and Bernhardt (1971) present population and cannot be assumed to be a evidence that the negative group fertility random sample of the population. All three differentials in education, income, and oc- of the previously mentioned American

studies found that the probability that an individual would not produce any offspring was inversely correlated with the IQ of the individual. Many very important sociological studies of differential fertility often exclude separated, divorced, and widowed individuals as well as nonmarried individuals from their samples. Therefore, demographers and geneticists should be very cautious with respect to utilizing such potentially biased data to predict the genetic consequences of the life styles in reproduction of a particular birth cohort.
Second, one must keep in mind the fact that as long as there is a large amount of variability with respect to individual human behavior patterns such as intelligence and personality within educational attainment, occupational or income groups, the group differentials in fertility cannot be strongly predictive with respect to ongoing change in the frequencies of genes underlying human behavior patterns (Bajema, 1966, 1968).
Third, the relationship between fertility and a behavior pattern such as intelligence is a dynamic relationship and is a function of the many social practices prevailing at any particular time in a particular society. The Eugenic Hypothesis predicted that the distribution of births in an industrial welfare-state democracy would become more eugenic as the environment improved with respect to health, educational and occupational opportunities, and particularly with respect to the spread of birth control to the point where freedom of parenthood became a reality for all citizens. The evidence from the studies reported above, inadequate as they may be for determining so large a problem, when coupled with other recent trends in differential fertility (Bajema, 1973), gives strong indications that the reproductive trend toward an increase in the frequency of genes associated with higher IQ discernible among some populations in the most recent generation of Americans

will probably continue in the foreseeable future in the United States and will be found also in other industrial welfare-state democracies.
Our conclusion is one of hope for the future. The environments that industrial welfare-state democracies are creating appear to be favorable in two ways. First, by bringing about a general improvement in the environment and by reducing socialclass inequities, particularly with respect to nutrition, health care, and educational and occupational opportunities, they are enhancing the phenotypic expression of the genetic potentialities of each and every one of their citizens. Second, these emerging environments produce childbearing patterns that appear to be bringing about an increase in the frequency of those genes in human populations which upon interaction with the environment lead to the development of above-average intelligence--a behavior pattern that enables individuals to cope more successfully with the challenges of their environments and to take more complete advantage of the opportunities for self-fulfillment present in society.
The genetic response to the many and varied environments of industrial welfarestate democracies should maintain the genetic and ecological diversity so desirable in human populations. These eugenic childbearing patterns are in large part the result of policies which have diminished socialclass inequities and increased equality of opportunity. The eugenic patterns are being brought about not by fallible authoritarian controls, of doubtful merit, but by wholly voluntary, unselfconscious, time-tested evolutionary processes which have brought man to his present condition, operating now mainly through the kindly method of differential births, and with a minimum of the harsh death selection of the past. In this light, the present trend in the evolution of man can be viewed with considerable optimism.
