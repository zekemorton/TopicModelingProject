The distribution of completed family size (or sibship size) has recently been a subject of interest for human biologists, geneticists, demographers, and social scientists; but a satisfactory fit of the observed data to any simple distribution has yet to be found. Since the variance of the family size distribution is much larger than its mean, a Poisson distribution is unlikely to fit. However, there is good empirical evidence that the distribution is nearly that of a negative binomial (Kojima and Kelleher, 1962). Certain theoretical considerations based on a birth process (discussed below) also lead to a negative binomial distribution.
In the process of fitting a negative binomial distribution to observed frequencies of completed family size from various sources, we have noticed that the number of childless families is invariably greater, usually much greater, than the fitted or expected number, although the fitting is generally good for the rest of the distribution. In fact, the observed number of childless families is inconsistent with the general form of a negative binomial distribution based on certain values of the parameters involved. This seems to suggest that the childless families may be a mixture of two types of families: (1) One is biologically fertile and could have children but did not;

this type of family should be a part of the general negative binomial distribution of family size. (2) Another type is either biologically or electively not fertile and thus has no children. The proportion of completed families belonging to this second type might be expected to vary among populations studied, due to sociocultural factors influencing the deliberate choice to have no children. The sterile families do not belong to the general distribution of completed family size. This communication reports the methods and results of fitting a negative binomial distribution to observed frequencies of family size and separating the two types of childless families so that we may obtain a finer estimate of the proportion of sterile families in the population. The theoretical considerations justifying a negative binomial distribution are discussed below.
A BIRTH PROCESS LEADING TO A NEGATIVE BINOMIAL DISTRIBUTION
The assumption that the size of a family follows a negative binomial distribution may possibly be justified from the following considerations of a pure birth process. The term "birth" is used in a broad sense here. In a family, it refers to the birth of a new offspring; in the theory of epidemics, it

simplicity, let us assume that the population initially has only one individual; that is, X(0) = 1. The population size X(t) is an integer-valued random variable although time t is continuous. The family {X(t)} then represents a birth process. The basic postulate about this process is that {X(t)} is a Markov process, thereby meaning that the probability distribution of the future size X(t + k), fora small time interval h > 0, depends only on that of the present size X(t) and not on that of the size in the past. Inthe following, we shall consider a comparatively simple type of pure birth

In any finite time interval (i.e., for a fixed t), the population cannot explode to infinity, although that can occur in infinite time. Also, we note that when the population grows from one individual to Nindividuals, the number of births ornew individuals added tothe population isN-- 1 in the time interval (0, t).
More generally, if the initial population size is X(0) = r individuals, it maybe shown (Chiang, 1968, p. S3) that the probability that the population size will be N at time t is

process known as the Yule process.

P{X(t)=N} =

Let the "birth rate" of the process be a positive number h This means that if at

N--l

time t there are k individuals in the popu-

lation, the probability that one birth takes place in the small time interval (t,t -\- h) is kl-^-oih), where o(k) isa negligibly small quantity compared with the length of the interval h. Also, the probability of having more than one birth inthe same small time interval is taken tobe o(h). These two assumptions may be written as follows:

where N^r. The number ofnew individuals added to the population is N-- r,in the time interval (0, t).
Now, wedefine a new process Y(t), where Y(t) = X(t) -- r is the number of births that occurred in the time interval (0, t),starting with apopulation ofsize r. The probability distribution of Y(t) may

Under these assumptions, itmay be shown that the probability that the population size at time t will be Nis
