ABSTRACT: Marriage in Indian society is a religious duty. Consanguineous marriage is common, where individuals prefer to marry within their clan (a unilateral kin group based on either matrilineal or patrilineal descent). Keeping in mind that this form of marriage has certain disadvantages for social and biological as well as demographic aspects of individuals and families, the present study examines the influence of mate selection (i.e., close relatives, distant relatives, not related) on female age at marriage, pregnancy wastages, and survival status of the first child. The study was designed based on the information collected on a sample size of 3,948 married women aged 13-49 in Tamil Nadu, India, by the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), 1992. Results suggest that 48 per cent of women in Tamil Nadu marry their relatives. This practice of marrying relatives is high in rural areas, among Hindus, Scheduled Castes/tribes, and illiterate women as compared to urban areas, among non-Hindus, non-SC/ST, and educated women, respectively. The bivariate analysis reveals that women marrying their close relatives had low age at marriage and experienced a higher per cent of pregnancy wastage and child loss (first child) as compared to those women marrying their distant relatives or nonrelatives. The result is found to be consistent even after controlling for selected background variables through multivariate techniques (applied separately for age at marriage, pregnancy wastages, and the survival status of first child). Hence, this study suggests that steps should be taken to inform people about the problems of marrying close relatives through appropriate IECprograms in Tamil Nadu.

Marriage in Indian society is a religious duty and one of the important stages through which every man and woman has to pass in order to achieve a status of completeness. By definition marriage not only brings two individuals together but the families of the couple as well. This social process of "togetherness" involves many dynamics, such as matching the horoscope or the social/economic situation of the bride/bridegroom and also examining their family backgrounds. Hence, the role of the elders or parents in selecting the mate is very important. As per Sanghvi (1982) there are three important regulations which largely

explain the pattern of marriages in the
country:
1. The regulation of endogamy (marriage within the group of birth) which is a most important attribute of caste.
2. The regulation of exogamy (marriage outside the group of birth) which applies to the sections into which a caste is divided. One of the important consequences of this regulation, as far as inbreeding is concerned, is to permit a marriage between children of two sisters or of a brother and sister, while prohibiting a marriage between children of two brothers.
3. The regulation of consanguineous marriages, which prohibits marriage between two individuals related through a

common male ancestor up to the seventh generation on the father's side and the fifth generation on mother's side.
According to the recent NFHS estimates (1992-93), the practice of marrying relatives is highest in Tamil Nadu (48.2 per cent) followed by Karnataka (37.2 per cent), Andhra Pradesh (36.5 per cent) and Maharashtra (28.3 per cent). The incidence of marriage between relatives is less than 10 per cent in all other states except for the Jammu region of Jammu and Kashmir (16.5 per cent), Goa (15.2 per cent), Arunachal Pradesh (13.8 per cent), and Kerala (11.0 per cent). Previous studies have also observed considerably higher levels of consanguinity in south India than in north India (Kapadia, 1958; Roychoudhury, 1976; Bittles et al., 1991). According to Bittles et al. (1991), on the average, 20-45 per cent of marriages in the primarily Hindu states of south India are contracted between close relatives, with uncleniece and cross-first-cousin unions, usually mother's brother's daughter, especially popular. Studies by Sanghvi (1982) and Govinda Reddy (1987) observed in the rural areas of Andhra Pradesh that around 45 per cent of all marriages were consanguineous. In the south the consanguinity prohibition is relaxed to conform to the prevailing custom of great preference for consanguineous marriage which originated at the time of entry of the Brahman influence in the first millennium (Sanghvi, 1982). This custom is an important way in which the south differs from the north as mentioned by B. C. Baudhayana (one of the earliest law givers) in his Dharmasutra (Sastri, 1955).
Earlier studies on mate selection in India and in other countries highlight the need for examining this issue, especially in demographic research. Some of these stud-

ies are grouped under different headings and are given below:
REASONS FOR MARRYING RELATIVES
There could be various reasons for the people of south India to prefer marriage between relatives. According to Dronamraju (1964) the main reasons are:
(1) to keep the cultivable land in larger subdivisions for growing food crops such as rice,
(2) parental influence, (3) the extreme youth of the brides, (4) mutual knowledge of families con-
cerned and (5) economic benefits, since the parents
and grandparents of the consanguineous spouses and their descendants can all live together in joint families, pooling their resources and sharing all expenditures.
Few studies have also highlighted that consanguineous marriages are preferred since they offer the optimum opportunity for compatibility, both between husband and wife and between the bride and her mother-in-law (Dronamraju and Meera Khan, 1963; Khlat et al., 1986; Reddy and Usha Rani, 1996).
However, Caldwell et al. (1983) observed that in south India the practice of marrying relatives is becoming less common, which they attributed to three reasons.
(1) The most common reason is an increased dowry if the boy's parents seeka marriage outside the family, because the tradition persists that the cost of marriage between relatives must be small.
(2) In a heterogeneous society (in terms of education and wealth), it is becoming more difficult to arrange an appropriate match within relatives, and hence it is necessary to search through a larger population.
(3) The third reason is a growing belief that such marriages might produce sickly children, an idea which is clearly

a cultural import (probably affected both by north Indian and Western attitudes).
INFLUENCE OF MATE SELECTION ON
FEMALE MARRIAGE AGE
Scholars are of the opinion that when marriage takes place between relatives the age at marriage of both males and females can be expected to be at younger ages since no searching and waiting for suitable mates is involved (Caldwell et al., 1983; Richard, 1988; Audinarayana, 1990; and Sureender, 1993). According to Kapadia (1958), "it very often happens that a bridegroom is not available within a small endogamous group. People cannot shed their endogamous habits and so they look for a partner for their daughter in the neighborhood. Time thus passes in the search for a bridegroom, and imperceptibly and unwillingly the girl grows up. This is the situation prevailing in the Hindu community today and it is bound to worsen." Sureender (1993) observed in rural areas of Pondicherry that the ages at marriage of both brides and bridegrooms of consanguineous marriages are lower than in nonconsanguineous marriages. According to the author, "people very much hesitate to go for unrelated matches since the practices and the normal way of living of those people may differ from their own, which may create the problem of adjustment between the bride/bridegroom and in-laws." Based on the above studies, we hypothesize that women marrying relatives would have a lower age at marriage compared to women marrying nonrelatives.
INFLUENCE OF MATE SELECTION ON
PREGNANCY WASTAGES
Genetically speaking, marriage among close relatives does have significant in-

fluence on fetal wastages. The scientific committee on the effects of atomic radiation set up by the United Nations (1962) critically examined studies in the United States, France, and Japan and found that rates of morbidity and mortality increased in the offspring of consanguineous marriages as compared to those of unrelated individuals. However, the studies are of very unequal scope and reliability for a quantitative analysis. However, there is convincing evidence linking inbreeding to increased rates of spontaneous abortion/ miscarriage (Neel and Schull, 1962; Schull et al, 1970; Al-Awadi et al., 1986). Boue and Boue (1973) observed that many early spontaneous abortions (those which are related to gametic compatibility) could be a result of genie and chromosomal anomalies. They also noted that this type of incompatibility seems related to the genetic homogeneity of couples. However, Reid (1976) in rural Sri Lanka observed that consanguinity of the couples was not found to affect significantly rates of spontaneous abortions, still-births, or deaths of later offsprings. On the other hand, a few studies have indicated that the incidence of congenital malformations is significantly higher in consanguineous progeny (FreireMaia et al., 1983; Jaber et al., 1992). From a biological viewpoint, the sharing of common "human leukocyte antigens" (genetic markers found on the surface of most nucleated cells of the body) by spouses, more probable in consanguineous marriages, has been claimed to be a contributory factor in difficulties initiating pregnancies and/or a history of recurrent spontaneous abortion (Bittles, 1994). Hence, the hypothesis tested in this study is that women marrying relatives would experience more pregnancy wastage than those marrying unrelated men.

INFLUENCE OF MATE SELECTION ON
SURVIVAL STATUS OF THE FIRST CHILD
Researchers generally argue that the survival status of the child also depends on the mate selection. Schull and his associates (1965) account for the elevated fertility of consanguineous couples in Japan as compensation for the higher mortality rates of their inbred offspring. There is also a general belief among the south Indians that marriages between relatives may produce unhealthy children (Caldwell et al., 1983). A study from south India, where a high proportion of childhood mortality was specifically diagnosed as genetic in origin (Radha Rama Devi et al., 1987), provides strong support for the hypothesis that deleterious recessive genes significantly determine childhood morbidity and mortality in communities with a high prevalence of consanguineous unions. Govinda Reddy (1987), while analyzing the effects of consanguineous marriages on fertility (among members of wealthier castes) in Andhra Pradesh, observed a higher child mortality among the offspring of consanguineous unions than among their counterparts. In a study carried out in Pakistan, infant mortality in each of the consanguineous classes was 12.7 per cent for double first cousins, 7.9 per cent for first cousins, 9.2 per cent for first cousins once removed/double second cousins, 6.9 per cent for second cousins, and 5.1 per cent among nonconsanguineous progeny (Bittles et al., 1993). Recently a positive association between consanguinity and mortality was noted by Bittles (1994) with excess deaths observed in the offspring of all consanguineous classes at all ages at death, even after controlling for nongenetic factors. Bittles and Neel (1994) observed in a predominantly

Hindu population of both rural and urban areas of Tamil Nadu that the percentage of mortality in first cousin offspring is higher than that of nonconsanguineous offspring. For instance, the authors noted that in rural areas of Tamil Nadu, 28.3 per cent of first cousin offspring die compared to 26.3 per cent of nonconsanguineous offspring. Hence, we hypothesize in this study that the survival status of the first child would be less for women marrying relatives compared to those marrying nonrelatives. The rationale of selecting the first order birth is that mate selection might have an immediate and strong effect on the first child rather than on subsequent births.
Overall, earlier studies have highlighted that marriage between relatives has certain disadvantages on social and biological, as well as demographic, aspects of individuals and family. However, the situation may turn out to be very different if recent information is analyzed. Hence, this particular issue has been considered for investigation in this paper. Since Tamil Nadu has a higher percentage of women marrying relatives than other states of India, this state is considered for the analysis. An attempt is made here to highlight the influence of mate selection on female marriage age, pregnancy wastage, and survival status of the first child among the women who were married only once by the time of survey. Although the practice of marrying relatives could result in malformations among babies and influence their intellectual capacity, these variables are not considered in this study due to nonavailability of data.

representative sample of 3,948 ever married women age 13-49 in Tamil Nadu, India, during 1992 is used for the purpose of this study.
Variable mate selection has been classified into three categories: close relatives, distant relatives, and not related. The category "close relatives" includes only persons marrying their first cousin, or second cousin, or uncle; those marrying other blood relations, or brother-in-law, or other nonblood relation are grouped in the category of "distant relatives." Those who marry outside their blood relations or outside their relatives are classified as those not related before marriage. The classification of close, distant, and not related reflects the biological or genetic influence of these variables. However, as the level of homozygosity is expected to vary between these three groups, care has been taken not to interpret the differences that would exist among them in precise biological terms.
For this paper, variable pregnancy wastage includes those women who had experienced spontaneous abortion or stillbirths in their reproductive life (coded as 1-experienced, 0-not experienced). The variable survival status of first child is measured as 1-surviving and 2-not surviving at the time of survey, for women who had given birth to at least one child.
Obviously, there are many factors in addition to mate selection that could affect age at marriage, pregnancy wastage, and survival status of the first child. Hence, based on the available literature (Caldwell et al., 1983; Audinarayana, 1990; Sureender, 1992; Shyamala, 1993), a few background variables were selected. These variables are: childhood place of residence (coded as 1-urban, 2-rural), religion (coded as Hindus, Muslims, and others),

caste (coded as O-sc/st, 1-others), age of women (continuous), female age at marriage (coded, while studying pregnancy wastage and survival status of the first child as women marrying below 18 years, marrying between 18-19 years, and marrying above 19 years), education of women (coded as illiterate and educated up to primary, middle, high school, and above), exposure to mass media (coded as those not exposed to any medium, exposed at least to one medium, two media, three media), knowledge about legal age at marriage for females (coded as 1-correct and 0-incorrect), age at menarche (coded as those below 13 years, between 13-14 years, and above 14 years), age of mother at first birth (continuous), and status of drinking water (coded as 0-unsafe, l-safe).
To study the influence of mate selection on female age at marriage, we use multiple regression technique. We use logistic regression to examine the influence of mate selection on pregnancy wastage and survival status of first child, since the dependent variable (pregnancy wastage and survival status of first child) is of more than one category.
CHARACTERISTICS OF
EVER-MARRIED WOMEN
Table 1 presents descriptive information on the sample of ever-married women. Nearly half of the women are under age 30. The percentage in each group increases up to age 25-29, reflecting the increase in the proportion married in successive age groups. The percentage declines after age 25-29, by which time most women have already married, reflecting the normal pyramidal shape of the age distribution (NFHS, 1992). The majority of women (70.2 per cent) stay in

rural areas and are Hindus (88 per cent); 19 per cent belong to Scheduled Castes/ Scheduled Tribes, and 81 per cent are from other caste groups. Half of the respondents are illiterate, and only 15 per cent have completed at least high school. In terms of their exposure to mass media, less than one-fourth have not been exposed to any medium. Nearly two-thirds are unaware of the legal female age at marriage which clearly reveals the weak enforcement of legislation on age at marriage. While only 15 per cent experienced their first monthly period before the age of 13, the corresponding percentages between the ages of 13-14 and above 14 years are 45 per cent and 40 per cent respectively. In the case of age at marriage, 52 per cent married before the age of 18, while 23.6 per cent and 24.4 per cent married between the ages of 18-19 and above 19 years, respectively. The mean age at marriage for females in Tamil Nadu is found to be 17.6 years. Around 21 per cent of women experienced pregnancy wastage at least once in their reproductive life, and 13 per cent of women lost their first child.
In the case of mate selection, 38.3 per cent of women in Tamil Nadu marry their close relatives; 9.9 per cent, their distant

relatives; and 51.7 per cent marry nonrelatives. Earlier studies by Rao et al., (1972, 1977) reveal that the frequency of consanguineous marriages in the rural and urban areas of Tamil Nadu were around 50 per cent and 30 per cent of all marriages, respectively. Further, according to the authors, the practice of marrying within relatives did not reveal any significant decline over the decades.
RESULTS
Table 2 provides information on mate selection for the rural and urban areas of Tamil Nadu by selected background characteristics. As compared to urban areas, the practice of marriage between relatives is high in rural areas. This finding could partly be attributed to changing cultural norms and practices in the urban areas due to increasing social awareness. This practice does not vary much by age in either rural or urban areas, indicating that there has not been significant change in mate selection over time. However, as compared to those women in the age group 45-49, slightly more women in the other age groups marry nonrelatives (except in the age group < = 19) both in rural and urban areas of Tamil Nadu.

An examination of mate selection by education of women reveals that educated women in both rural and urban areas are more likely to marry nonrelatives than are illiterate women. For instance, in urban areas, 68.5 per cent of women educated up to high school and above marry nonrelatives as compared to 55.3 per cent among illiterate women. This finding clearly reveals the influence of education on the mate selection procedure.
The table further shows that women of the Hindu religion are more likely to marry relatives than women belonging to other religions. This finding is the same both in rural and urban areas of Tamil

Nadu which reflects the fact that this cultural practice is more strongly followed by Hindus than by Muslims or Christians. Further, in the Muslim community, uncle-niece marriages are not at all preferred which could also have contributed to the difference between Hindus and Muslims in the percentage of women marrying unrelated men.
The caste picture reveals that the percentage of Scheduled Caste/Tribe women marrying their relatives is comparatively higher than for other caste women in both rural and urban areas. However, this finding is not consistent with earlier studies. According to Govinda Reddy (1987), in

Vol. 45, No. 3-4

Mate Selection

Andhra Pradesh higher caste women marry relatives more often than do Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. He explains, "higher castes follow this practice to avoid splitting their movable and immovable properties through dowry and bride price." This inconsistency in the finding could be partly attributed to the broad grouping of the variable "caste" as "SC/ST" and "others" in this study. Since the category "others" includes both forward and backward caste populations, it is possible that the real influence of the variable "caste" is not captured. However, because of the problems related to the grouping of different castes as forward and backward, this exercise is not carried out in this study.
Table 3 provides information on average female age at marriage by mate selection. It indicates that the average female age at marriage for those marrying their close relatives is 16.90 years as compared to 17.60 years and 18.27 years for those marrying their distant relatives and those marrying unrelated men, respectively.
This finding clearly indicates that there is a relationship between mate selection and female age at marriage, supported by a significant one-way analysis of variance between these groups. However, to strengthen this relationship, a few background variables have been controlled by the regression analysis. The independent variables that have been considered for the analysis apart from the variable mate selection are: current age of women, religion, caste, childhood place of residence, female education, age at menarche, exposure to mass media, and knowledge about female legal age at marriage. These explanatory variables are regressed with the female age at marriage, and the results given in Table 5. The results of regression

analysis reveal that those women marrying close relatives or distant relatives have a significantly lower age at marriage is compared to the reference category, i.e., not related, even after controlling for the rest of the background variables.
Among the rest of the explanatory variables, religion, caste, age at menarche, education of women, and childhood place of residence were found to significantly influence the female age at marriage. Nonscheduled caste women, those residing in urban areas, those with higher age at menarche, and those with better educational attainment were found to have a higher age at marriage as compared to scheduled caste/tribe women, women residing in rural areas, women with low mean age at menarche, and illiterate women, respectively.
Table 4 reveals the relationship between mate selection and the experience of pregnancy wastage. Women marrying their close relatives were found to experience higher pregnancy wastage (22.7 per cent) as compared to those marrying their distant relatives (21.6 per cent) and those marrying nonrelatives (18.7 per cent). To strengthen the relationship, background variables like age of women, childhood place of residence, religion, caste, education of women, female age at marriage, and age of mother at first birth are considered along with the variable mate selection.

Taking the background variables and pregnancy wastages as the dependent variables, we used logistic regression analysis, the results of which are given in Table 5.
Table 5 shows that the odds of pregnancy wastage was 1.3 times higher among those women who married close relatives as compared to those marrying nonrelatives. To an extent, this finding indicates that there is a significant relationship between mate selection and pregnancy wastages even after controlling for the influence of other background variables. Although those women marrying distant relatives also experienced higher pregnancy wastages than those marrying nonrelatives, the existing difference appears to be statistically insignificant.
In the case of the other explanatory variables, age of women, age at marriage, and mother's age at first birth significantly influence the chance of experiencing pregnancy wastage. Older women, those marrying early, and those having their first child at a later age experienced more pregnancy wastage compared to younger women, those marrying late, those having their first child at a younger age, respectively. The positive influence of women's age at first birth on pregnancy wastage clearly indicates the problems associated with late pregnancy.

The relationship between mate selection and the survival status of the first child is given in Table 6. It reveals that 16.8 per cent of women marrying close relatives lost their first child as compared to 15 per cent and 11.5 per cent of women marrying distant relatives and women marrying unrelated men, respectively. The chi-square value also indicates a significant relation between these two variables.
At the second step, background variables like age of women, religion, caste, childhood place of residence, mother's age at first birth, female age at marriage, education of women, and the status of drinking water are considered along with the variable mate selection and related to the survival status of the first child. Logistic regression analysis is used for this purpose and the results are given in Table 5. This table reveals that even after controlling for the selected background variables women marrying close relatives lost their first child significantly more often than did women marrying nonrelatives, i.e., 1.3 times more often than the reference category women. Although the percentage of women who lost their first child is high for those marrying distant relatives as compared to the reference group (i.e., not related), the difference is statistically insignificant. In addition to the variable mate selection, age of women, mother's age at first birth, educational level, and caste of women also play a significant role in influencing the survival status of the first-born child.

mainly to avoid sharing of property outside the family. Further, a general view is that parents marry off their daughters to a known family so that if there is any problem in the future, it could be easily solved. In these kind of marriages, the age of the girls is given least importance. This practice of marrying relatives is high in rural areas, among Hindus, Scheduled Castes/ tribes, and illiterate women as compared to urban areas, non-Hindus, non-SC/ST, and educated women, respectively.
The second analysis examines the influence of mate selection on female age at marriage, using the multiple regression technique. The results reveal that even after controlling for selected background variables, women marrying their relatives have a low age at marriage compared to their counterparts. It is possible that in nonconsanguineous marriage, the searching process takes a long time, and hence the female marriage age is high as compared to that of women marrying relatives.
The third and fourth analysis examine the influence of mate selection on preg-

nancy wastage and the survival status of the first child, respectively, by applying the logistic regression technique. The results show that those women marrying close relatives experience more pregnancy wastage and child loss (first child) compared to those marrying distant relatives and those marrying nonrelatives. To some extent this finding indicates the problem in marrying close relatives and suggests that adequate attention should be paid to the issue of mate selection in demographic analyses.
Especially now when the state of Tamil Nadu is nearing the replacement level of fertility, the major areas which require attention by state government are (1) to reduce infant mortality and pregnancy wastages, and (2) to further increase female age at marriage. To achieve these goals requires curtailing the practice of marrying relatives. Although the Hindu Marriage Act of 1955 prohibits uncleniece marriages, it has been largely ignored as is shown by the significant proportion of consanguineous marriages still taking place in Tamil Nadu. Since people may outweigh any biological disadvantages for the socioeconomic advantages of consanguineous unions, what we require more than legislation is a vigorous mass campaign to tackle this issue. The available Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) programs should try to highlight the problems related to these types of marriages along with their other campaigns relating to health and welfare.
