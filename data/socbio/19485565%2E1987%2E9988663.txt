ABSTRACT:A sample of 94 children with low birthweights (LBW 2500 grams) was identified in a group of 857 children who took part in an 18-year follow-up study of the Danish Prospective Perinatal Cohort. The LBW group was compared with the rest of the sample on a set of longterm intellectual and psychosocial outcomes. In addition, the relative predictive power of low birthweight and a set of environmental variables regressed on two adolescent academic outcomes was examined. No significant residual or complicating effects of LBW were found on any outcomes after 18 years. However, full-birthweight adolescents possessed diferential characteristics with respect to the pattern of correlated environmental variables. LBW adolescents appear to have a greater sensitivity to environmental influences. For males, stability of adult figures and general order and structure are more conducive to an optimal outcome; for females, the strongest predictor was level of maternal psychological adaptation or general contentment.

Inquiry describing long-term intellectual and psychosocial characteristics of infants born "at risk" for developmental problems has proliferated over the last decade (see Kopp, 1982, for a detailed review). Considerable research has focused on development over time of the low-birthweight (LBW) infant. (Beckwith and Cohen, 1984; Caputo et al., 1981; Drillien et al. 1980;Neligan et al., 1976; Weineretal., 1965).
Despite improvements in neonatal medicine which have reduced mortality and morbidity rates, the number of school-related problems of low-birthweight children remains disproportionately high (Francis-Williams and Davies, 1974; Kitchen et al., 1980; Neligan et al., 1976; Zachau-Christiansen, 1979). This is particularly true in children from lower socioeconomic groups. Although the incidence of serious school problems and handicapping conditions in low-birthweight children has been reduced since Drillien's (1964)

seminal study in which 40 per cent of the sample developed later intellectual and neurological problems, these children remain a vulnerable group. Later school performance of low-birthweight children and the interaction between birthweight and social class factors are still issues of central importance to developmental psychologists and educational researchers.
While follow-up studies of lowbirthweight children to early school age are not uncommon, few prospective longitudinal studies have traced the development of low-birthweight children through adolescence to young adulthood. Kopp and Parmelee (1979) noted that functional impairments arising from adverse perinatal events are likely to be most evident in the performance of very young children. However, as children grow older, characteristics of the environment seem to assume considerably greater influence. Sameroff and Chandler (1975) have noted the increas-

ing importance of what they call "the continuum of caretaking casualty"; Wilson (1985) has described the importance of support from the home environment for recovery from the longterm effects of low birthweight in twins; and, Beckwith and Parmelee (1986) found LBW children from stable middle-class homes to show no residual intellectual or EEG abnormalities at age five. On the other hand, LBW children from less stable or lower SES homes continued to show both types of deviance.
INTERACTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS
AND LOW BIRTHWEIGHT
Most studies have focused on socioeconomic status (SES) as the primary indicator of environmental adequacy. Several researchers have been able to show that the long-term effects of low birthweight are more severe in a lower social class environment and seem vitiated by a higher social class environment (Drillien, 1964; Weiner et al., 1965; Werner et al., 1971; Wilson, 1985). However, the association of SES with negative developmental outcomes does little to identify the specific characteristics of the child's environment that cause less optimal development and at the same time might be amenable to preventive or remedial intervention. Recent research has been directed toward a more refined description of the global SES variable by attempting to identify the critical elements within the social context that interact with individual characteristics to produce predictable outcomes.
One such cluster of critical elements has been identified as the characteristics of the mother or primary caregiver.

Drillien (1964), in an early attempt to describe maternal characteristics, studied a variable she called "maternal efficiency." This variable was comprised of aspects of the maternal care received by the child. Drillien related maternal efficiency to the incidence of accidents and illness in a sample of premature subjects; but she did not analyze it in relation to academic outcomes. Nevertheless, Drillien recognized the significance of the mother's ability to effectively organize the child's environment in relation to the child's physical development. Mother's IQ, which may be related to maternal efficiency, has also been shown to influence long-term negative consequences in LBW infants (Werner et al., 1971). Werner and her colleagues further observed that the stability of the home constituted an additional significantinteractive agent.
More recently, researchers from the Infant Studies Project at the University of California, Los Angeles (Beckwith and Cohen, 1984; Beckwith et al., 1976; Sigman et al., 1981), have hypothesized that the mediating link between early medical and neurological events and later competencies in their pre-term subjects is the nature of the interaction between infant and caregiver. Sigman et al. (1981) concluded that the importance of environmental factors supercedes that of early medical events, and further, that these factors are more influential for females than for males.
It is clear that variables such as maternal efficiency or orderliness, amount and quality of caregiver-infant interaction, and stability of the family are correlated with socioeconomic status (Bronfenbrenner, 1979, and others). When families experience economic duress, maintaining an organized and stable home where there is continuity of at-

tention paid to young children becomes increasingly difficult. It is, however, also clear that many mothers from lower social classes do have the resources and the ability necessary for maintaining stable conditions in the home despite economic hardship (Baker and Mednick, 1984). One purpose of the inquiry reported here is to determine the influence of a set of maternal and home descriptor variables that may function somewhat independently of SES. Since in many instances such variables are more amenable to manipulation or change than SES, the analyses reported here may result in heuristics useful in the design of treatment variables and intervention strategies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The analyses reported in this paper were completed as a part of an 18-year follow-up study of a group of 857 children who took part in a Danish prospective perinatal study. Children with low birthweight (LBW ^ < 2500 grams) were compared with the remainder of the follow-up sample born at normal or full birthweight (FBW) on a set of longterm intellectual and psychosocial outcome variables. In addition, the notion that LBW children are more sensitive to environmental stress was examined using two outcome variables defined in terms of overall adjustment to and academic success in school. The predictive power of a set of environmental variables in relation to these outcomes was determined for the LBW group and was subsequently compared with the predictive power of the same variables for the full sample. Thus, this paper represents an attempt to follow a group of LBW children to late adolescence to determine whether or not there are any resid-

ual or complicating effects of LBW still to be found after 18 years. The paper also attempts to provide further clarification of the nature and persistence over time of the specific sensitivity of LBW children to defined environmental variables. The value of this type of analysis rests in its potential contribution to the design of preventive and facilitative intervention strategies.
Two previously published papers that used a sample drawn from the Danish Prospective Perinatal Study had a direct influence on the design of the inquiry reported in this paper. Using a subsample (TV= 349) drawn from the perinatal study, Zachau-Christiansen (1979) found 12-year-olds who were LBW infants to have experienced more academic and intellectual problems than their full-birthweight classmates. However, in a reanalysis of the same data, Zachau-Christiansen and Mednick (1981) significantly modified the 1979 findings. It was pointed out in the 1981 paper that the 349 LBW subjects originally analyzed by Zachau-Christiansen represented a significantly lower SES distribution than the comparison group of full-birthweight classmates. Low SES in other studies has been found to be strongly associated with both poor academic achievement and intellectual problems (Broman et al., 1975; Caputo et al., 1981; Sameroff and Chandler, 1975; Sameroff, 1981). Similarly, a strong association between low SES and poor intellectual performance was also observed in the data reported in the 1979 paper. Thus, in the 1981 reanalysis Zachau-Christiansen and Mednick concluded that the 1979 findings presented an exaggerated estimate of the influence of LBW on the functioning of 12-yearolds. As a matter of fact, the 1981analy-

sis confirmed the finding of a strong interaction of LBW with low SES in the development of long-term intellectual and academic deficiencies.
Although the present study also used subjects from the Danish Perinatal Study, the sample selection differed from the 1979 study in two important ways: (1) Both LBW and comparison subjects were drawn from the Perinatal Sample, and (2) the SES distribution of the LBW group did not differ significantly from that of the comparison group. Thus, the confounding of LBW with SES that influenced the 12-year follow-up study in 1979 was eliminated in the study reported here. This, coupled with the fact that the subjects in this study were 18 rather than 12 years old, warranted an expectation that the LBW group would reflect considerably fewer problems than was shown in both the 1979 study and the 1981 reanalysis. This prediction is based on the general tendency reported in the literature (see references above) for low birthweight to become progressively less predictive of intellectual problems with increasing age.
SUBJECTS
The 857 mother-infant dyads sampled were randomly drawn from a Danish birth cohort consisting of all births that took place at the University Hospital in Copenhagen (Righospitalet) between September 1959 and December 1961. The total birth cohort consisted of 9,125 deliveries who served as subjects in a Danish prospective longitudinal project aimed at investigating the relationship between pre- and perinatal factors and children's later health and development. The purpose and procedures of the Danish Perinatal Project

have been described in detail in previous publications (Baker and Mednick, 1984; Zachau-Christiansen and Ross, 1975). Of the 857 subjects who took part in the 18-year follow-up study, 94 lowbirthweight infants (=s2500 grams) had full data sets related to all of the variables; similarly, a total of 701 fullbirthweight infants had full data sets.
The 795 subjects included in these analyses represent the whole range of the SES distribution, but have a slightly lower mean SES in comparison to relevant Danish population statistics. In addition, the sample includes a larger proportion of subjects whose mothers were teenagers and/or unmarried at the time of birth. This is due to a policy which was in effect during the data collection years. At that time all unmarried mothers from the Copenhagen metropolitan area were referred to the University Hospital for pre- and neonatal care. The reason for the disproportionately large number of LBW children found in the follow-up sample (approximately 12 per cent) is again related to the special admission policies of the University Hospital during the years in question. At that time, women from the entire Copenhagen area with histories of LBW deliveries or with complications in the present pregnancy were referred to this hospital. The majority of the LBW infants were also born prematurely, although some subjects were full-term and small for gestational age (Lubchenco, 1976).
DATA COLLECTION
Current addresses of the subjects were obtained from the Danish Population Register for purposes of the followup. The mothers of the subjects were contacted initially by an experienced

98

clinical social worker who explained the goals of the project and encouraged them to take part.
Through a carefully constructed interview protocol the mothers were queried in their homes about the family environment and about life history and characteristics of the index child. These interviews lasted approximately two hours and were performed by social workers who had undergone intensive training in the administration of the interview and the coding of the responses. During the interview, permission was requested by the social worker to contact a subset of the children's schools and obtain information from the teachers concerning the academic and psychosocial adjustment of the subjects. When the school was contacted, the teacher who had had the greatest amount of contact was asked to complete a detailed questionnaire. Teacher questionnaires were completed for 331 of the 795 students. Comparisons between these subjects and those for whom no teacher data was collected showed no differences in terms of social and maternal characteristics at the time of the index child's birth or at follow-up. Thus, generalization of reported findings based on the 331 subjects to the total sample of 795 seems warranted. Similar comparisons were made within the LBW and FBW groups to determine if there were differences between those with teacher ratings (LBW = 51; FBW = 280) and without teacher ratings (LBW = 43; FBW = 421). No differences were found.
DESCRIPTION OF THE OUTCOME
VARIABLES
Scales Derived from the Mother Interview.--Two scales derived from the mother's interview relate to the

mother's perception of the child's performance and adjustment in school. Both mother interview scales were first identified in an exploratory factor analysis of the original items. The first scale, Child's Academic Performance, consisted of the mother's ratings of the child's performance on an array of cognitive activities (e.g., reading) on a 3point scale. The Academic Performance scale had an alpha reliability of 0.77. The second scale, Child's School Problems, was derived from a "problems" factor that included moderately high loadings for a fairly heterogenous set of perceptions, for example, that the child had repeated a grade and had been given individual remedial tutoring. This scale yielded an alpha reliability of 0.52. These data were available for the total follow-up sample (LBW = 94; FBW = 701).
Scales Derivedfrom the Teacher Ratings of the Child.--Like the mother's interview, the teacher's questionnaire was administered when the index child was between 17 and 19years old so as to obtain ratings of the child's intellectual, emotional, and social functioning by the teacher who in each case was most familiar with the child. In general, the teacher was given a trait (e.g., moody) and asked to rate the child on a 5-point scale. Ten scales derived from the teacher questionnaire were used in the analyses reported here. The first four relate to academic performance and cognitive ability, and the last six relate to aspects of the child's psychosocial adjustment. The ten scales and reliabilities were: (1) Mathematics Proficiency, 0.95; (2) Reading Proficiency, 0.90; (3) Work Organization Skills, 0.88;. (4) Reasoning Skills, 0.88; (5) Emotionality, 0.86; (6) Peer Relations, 0.75; (7) Aggression, 0.81; (8) Impulsivity, 0.81;

(9) Self-Serving Assertiveness, 0.75; and (10) Social Responsibility, 0.90. These data were available for 51 LBW children and 280 FBW children.
DATA ANALYSES
The initial analyses involved a series of /-tests comparing the LBW group with the FBW group on all of the outcome measures. The purpose of this set of analyses was to determine if there were any differences between the two groups on measures of academic and psychosocial outcomes during adolescence. Comparison of LBW children with FBW children on these outcome variables provides information on whether there has been a protraction and generalization of the physical risks associated with LBW to long-term academic and psychosocial adjustment in adolescence.
Where the focus of the above analyses was on comparisons of long-term outcome measures, the second set of analyses was an attempt to better understand differential patterns of antecedent variables that may account for the variability on the outcome measures within defined groups. The second part of the inquiry consisted of a set of multiple regression analyses of the "school problems" and "academic performance" outcomes. The specific purpose of these analyses was to describe the differential sensitivity to environmental variables within the LBW group and the total sample, by sex. In the first two regression analyses eight independent variables were regressed on the school problems outcome for the total sample (N = 795), with males and females analyzed separately. In the second two analyses, the males (iV = 51) and the females ( # = 43) were analyzed separately within the LBW sample. The

latter analyses involved only seven predictors, since birthweight was left out. The same sequence of analyses was completed for the "academic performance" outcome.
The reason for analyzing the sexes separately is that the literature is inconclusive with respect to sex differences in sensitivity to environmental factors. As noted earlier, previous research with low-birthweight children has shown some indication that females are more sensitive to certain types of environmental influences (Beckwith and Cohen, 1984; Sigman et al., 1981). However, in general, the literature on sex differences in sensitivity to environmental factors indicates that males are the more sensitive (Gottesman, 1974; Maccoby and Jacklin, 1974; Mitchell, 1981). Outcomes derived from the teacher ratings were not similarly analyzed because the numbers in the subsample cells were too small.
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREDICTOR
VARIABLES
As noted previously, the quality of infant-caretaker interaction has been found to be an important factor in the development of LBW infants. In this study, the following home environment descriptors were used to indicate the several dimensions that are assumed to influence the adult-child interaction patterns of the home:
Number of FamilyConstellations.-- This variable is denned by the continuity provided by the adult figures in the child's immediate environment, as measured by the number of changes in family constellations. A change was recorded every time an adult moved in or out of the home, e.g., father moving out, relative or stepfather moving in. A change was also recorded whenever the

Since the responses to the questions were based on the interviewers' subjective evaluations rather than on concrete or recorded events, detailed sets of coding conventions were preestablished and continuous interinterviewer comparisons of codings were carried out. This procedure was followed to increase scale reliability and to ensure greater validity of the descriptions of the infants' home environment.

Socioeconomic Status.--The information used in calculating the subject's socioeconomic status was obtained from the mother's interview. The scale used was developed by Svalastoga (1959) for specific use with Danish populations. The coding range from "0" for an unskilled worker to "7" for a person with higher academic education and/or one occupying a leadership position.

more delay in reaching developmental milestones. We would expect a difference between the low and full birthweight infants on this measure, since many of the LBW subjects were also premature and therefore were of a younger conceptional age at one year. The information on which this variable is based was collected by the Danish Perinatal Project staff during the oneyear follow-up examination in which the whole sample took part. A detailed description of the data items included may be found in Mednick et al. (1983). In regression analyses involving the male and female LBW groups, the birthweight variable was excluded from the set of predictors.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows the means and standard deviations for the low and full birthweight groups on the outcome variables. There are no significant differ-

ences between the means of the two groups. Thus, it appears that on these longer-term outcomes the LBW group does not show any differential impairment, although the mean differences between the two groups consistently favor the full birthweight group. An analysis of the LBW group based on differences in size for gestational age also yielded no significant differences on the outcome measures (Hunt, 1982).
In the regression analyses, both stepwise and simultaneous solutions were computed. In the stepwise solution (Cohen and Cohen, 1975), variables were entered on the basis of the size of their contribution to the squared multiple correlation. In the simultaneous solution (Cohen and Cohen, 1975), the effect of each independent variable was tested after all other independent variables were held constant by partialling. Only variables which were significant in the stepwise solution were included in the simultaneous solution.

Simultaneous and stepwise regres-
sion produced the following statistics for
each of the independent variables:
1. Squared semipartial correlation (stepwise solution)--the increase in the squared multiple correlation which results when an independent variable is added to the stepwise solution.
2. F-ratio (stepwise solution)--a test of the significance of the squared semipartial correlation in a stepwise solution.
3. Squared semipartial correlation (simultaneous solution)--the increase in the squared multiple correlation which results when an independent variable is entered into the regression after all other independent variables are in the regression (i.e., the unique contribution of an independent variable in the regression).
4. F-ratio (simultaneous-solution)--a test of the significance of the unique contribution of an independent variable.

variables for the male and female

matrix for the predictor variables included in the analyses. Tables 4 and 5 present the results of the two regression analyses.
The analysis of the male sample included 344 subjects; the R2 for the three significant predictors was 0.20. Number of Family Constellations contributed the most to the equation: 11 per cent in the stepwise and 9per cent in the simultaneous solution. Two additional variables contributed significantly: Mother's Contentmentaccounted for 6 per cent of the variance in the stepwise and 4 per cent in the simultaneous solution; andMother's Orderliness accounted for 3 per cent of the variance in each solution. None of the other predictors reached significance.
Table 5 presents the corresponding analyses with the female subsample of 357 subjects. The R2 for the significant predictors was only 0.09. The same three variables which showed significance in the male sample contributed to the equation in the female sample, although in a different order of importance. Note, however, that the predictors accounted for considerably less variance in the female sample.Mother's

DISCUSSION
These analyses indicate that the 94 LBW subjects included in this study did «o/have significantly more difficulties in school during late adolescence than did the same-aged full-birthweight controls. However, the means for the LBW group consistently indicated comparatively lower functioning. These results are consistent with the predictions made in the introduction and with the findings of Sameroff and Chandler (1975), Mednick and Zachau-Christiansen (1981), Birch and Gussow (1970), and Beckwith and Parmelee (1986). That is, while the LBW variable serves to identify an "at risk" group at birth, in infancy and during long childhood, its residual influence on long-term academic and psychosocial outcomes seems minimal. Environmental influences become increasingly more important as the child grows older. The issue thus becomes one of determining which social variables contribute the most to selected long-term outcomes of interest. More specifically, do low- and full-birthweight adolescents possess differential characteristics with respect to the environmental variables of influence?
The regression analyses of the total samples of males and females show that the same three environmental variables contribute the most to the variance associated with the composite school problems variable: Number of Family Constellations, Mother's Orderliness, and Mother's Contentment. The amount of variance accounted for by these three variables in the male subsample is twice

that accounted for in the female subsample, indicating a somewhat greater sensitivity to those conditions in males. This finding supports the notion of overall greater sensitivity in males suggested by Maccoby and Jacklin (1974). The fact that SES did not represent a significant contribution to either regression analysis indicated that once the variance associated with the three significant predictors was accounted for, the unique variance associated with SES was too small to contribute any further to the solution.
The amount of variance "explained" in the male LBW sample was remarkably higher than was explained in the full-birthweight males and in both groups of females. The two most robust predictors were Mother's Orderliness and Number of Family Constellations. Together, these two variables accounted for approximately 61 per cent of the variance in the LBW male sample. Clearly there is a strong indication that the LBW males in this study are especially sensitive to the lack of structure and order in the physical environment (maternal orderliness) and in the social environment (constellation changes or lack of continuity in available adults).
The third significant predictor was One Year Motor Development, accounting for an increment of 4 per cent of the outcome variable variance. It is not surprising that this predictor, which involves an early indicator of the degree of physical impairment, contributed to the LBW male equation. Maccoby and Jacklin (1974) have gathere'd evidence that males in general are more vulnerable, and perhaps constitutionally weaker, than females in infancy. One Year Motor Development did not contribute to the equations for either sex in the total sample analyses or to the equa-

tion in the LBW female analysis. The two significant environmental variables contributed considerably more unique variance to the equation in the analyses of the LBW males. This is consistent with the findings of Sameroff and Chandler (1975) who noted that after the first few years environmental variables are more reliable predictors of intellectual performance than early medical variables.
The LBW females also show heightened sensitivity to environmental factors as a function of their special condition, but not so dramatic as is the case with males. At first glance, the analyses of the female sample do not support the findingof Sigman et al. (1981) that environmental variables are more predictive of later outcomes in female LBW subjects than in males. A closer examination, however, warrants speculation that LBW females may be particularly sensitive to one very specific type of environmental influence. Our finding that the female LBW group shows high sensitivity to maternal contentment intuitively seems consistent with the results of Sigman et al. (1981) that the characteristics of the mother's interaction style during infancy are particularly influential for female LBW infants. There seems to be a suggestion in these findings that females are more influenced by characteristics of the mother than by anything else in their environment. This may be an effect of the higher degree of identification and the more systematic modeling that takes place between female children and their mothers. Since the Sigman et al. (1981) study and the present one both deal with LBW children, it is of interest to note that Baker and Mednick (1984) found the total female group to be more influenced by mother characteristics (particularly her

contentment) than by other environmental factors such as family stability.
SUMMARY
It is clear that the LBW females in this sample in general do not show heightened sensitivity to environmental factors, at least those included in these analyses. However, the maternal contentment variable does have significant predictive power in the female sample. Since variables describing the psychological make-up of the maternal figure have been less frequently analyzed in previous research than variables such as SES, maternal education, and family stability, what appears in this study to be a female sensitivity to maternal psychological characteristics has remained relatively ignored. On the other hand, data from the total male sample support the literature with regard to a heightened sensitivity of males to environmental factors (Gottesman, 1974; Maccoby and Jacklin, 1974; Mitchell, 1981; Wender, 1971), and, as hypothesized in this study, this sensitivity was observed to an even greater extent in the LBW males. It should be noted that the LBW males did not reflect significant sensitivity to the psychological characteristic, maternal contentment. In the total sample analyses (Mednick and Baker, 1981), males were also found to be significantly less influenced by this variable and more influenced by other environmental variables.
The reported findings have some implications for the design of intervention procedures aimed at preventing longterm impairment in LBW children. For males, it appears that environmental situations characterized by stability of adult figures and general order and

structure aremore conducive to optimal outcomes. Infemale LBW subjects, the heuristics for intervention designs are less clear. The strongest predictor, maternal contentment, isconsiderably less powerful andobviously more difficult to manipulate.
