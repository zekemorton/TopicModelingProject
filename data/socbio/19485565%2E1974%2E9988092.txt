At the present time, 28 nations in the developing world are implementing family planning programs in support of official policies to reduce their rates of population growth (Nortman, 1972). The considerable efforts of these countries are hampered by two factors. These programs have failed to attract participation by sufficiently large proportions of the populations of these societies, and the successful practice of family planning is all too frequently a relatively brief event on the part of many adopters. Discontinuation of contraception and the related phenomenon of change of method are closely associated with the latter problem.
Pregnancy prevention techniques may be classified into two general categories: coitus-connected and coitus-independent (Polgar, 1965). Techniques included in the coitus-connected category include rhythm, withdrawal, condom, diaphragm, foam, and similar approaches. Coitus-independent techniques are divorced from the sexual act, and they included oral contraception (the pill), the intrauterine device (the IUD), injections of progestational agents, and male and female sterilization. In general, the coitus-independent methods are more effective in preventing pregnancy.

While evidence indicates that some coitusconnected methods have a potentially high degree of effectiveness (Lehfeldt, 1965; Kantner, 1966), the reliability of others is questioned (Whelpton and Kiser, 1959).
The use of contraception hinges on motivation and acceptability of the method (Pohlman, 1969, p. 351). The decision to participate in a family planning program indicates a degree of motivation. Acceptability is a factor in determining whether the motivation will continue. Interviews by Rainwater (1960) provided a number of vivid comments by couples concerning the nuisance effect of contraception with coitus-connected methods. This is particularly true for the "masculine" methods of condom and withdrawal. Westoff (1961) indicated that women appear to have a greater capacity to defer impulse gratification required with the use of coitusconnected methods. Rhythm also ranks low in the acceptability dimension because of the restrictions it places on sexual activity. As Pohlman (1969, p. 351) notes, "A highly effective method may be far from ideal in terms of its interference with sex relations, and hence may not be considered highly effective."

from intercourse avoids inconvenience inherent with coitus-connected methods. The IUD may remain in place for an extended period of time (Segal, 1964). The oral contraceptive pill, requiring daily use, avoids inconvenience, but requires a greater degree of continued motivation. In terms of acceptability, side effects and the need to remember the daily routine are major limiting factors in oral contraception. Zatuchni (1970, p. 105), reported that 47 per cent of pill discontinuation resulted from side effects. In a study of a family planning program in Honduras, it was found that 70 per cent of those women who no longer visited family planning clinics had ceased to use contraception. Of this group, 54 per cent reported having problems with family planning methods, primarily the pill (Nesman et al., 1971). Using a nationwide probability sample of women in the United States, Westoff and Ryder (1968) found that one-third of all women who reported using the pill for contraceptive purposes had discontinued taking it; 65 per cent of these women stated they had ceased taking the pill because of side effects. Similar dropout problems are reported in other studies (Jones and Mauldin, 1967; Taiwan Population Studies Center, 1968). Ambivalence has been described as one of the factors associated with the failure to follow daily use requirements of the pill (Lehfeldt, 1955; Lehfeldt and Guze, 1966), and some authors have suggested that side effects associated with both the pill and the IUD may be psychogenic (Goldzieher et al., 1971; Aznar-Ramos et al., 1969; King, 1967).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data were collected 1971-72 through interviews resulting from a series of audits of family planning clinics. Each of the ten agencies included in these audits oper-

ated a number of clinics, which accounted for about 75 per cent of the family planning acceptors in public clinics in the Philippines. An auditing firm was employed to randomly select clinics from each of the agencies to conduct interviews with 30 acceptors, also selected at random from clinic records. In order to qualify for inclusion in the sample, a clinic must have been in operation for at least one year and to have recruited a minimum of 200 reported acceptors. Clinics were expected to maintain follow-up records on acceptors and to serve as a source of contraceptive supplies for those needing them in order to remain active in the family planning program.
The audits were conducted with a dual purpose: (1) to determine the accuracy of information reported in clinic records, and (2) to ascertain the number of acceptors who had discontinued use of a family planning method or moved from the area served by the clinic. Information in this report involves only those women who were interviewed and does not focus upon migration or inaccuracies detected in clinic records.
Interviewers were trained by the auditing firm and, whenever possible, interviews were conducted in the home of the acceptor. A total of 1,321 interviews were conducted. Each respondent was asked which method she had originally accepted, whether or not she was continuing with the method, changed to another method, or discontinued use. When the respondent indicated that she was no longer practicing family planning, an effort was made to establish the reason for termination.
Although clinics included in this report represented a major portion of reported acceptors for the Philippines and the selection of both clinics and interviewees involved the use of a table of random

numbers, some limitations are evident. First, each clinic contributed about the same number of interviewees regardless of the number of acceptors on the records, Second, the absence of information on selected sample subjects who migrated from the area creates some bias.

A statistical comparison of women who continued to practice family planning with dropouts for coitus-connected and coitusindependent acceptors by means of Yule's Q indicated a negligible negative association (--0.006). It appeared that there was no appreciable relationship between acceptance of a coitus-independent or coitusconnected method and the decision to continue participation in family planning program. This finding suggests a similar

A total of 743 (56.2 per cent) of the acceptors were continuing with the method originally accepted at the clinic, 264 (20.0 per cent) changed methods, and 314 (23.8 per cent) reported that they were no longer participating in family planning.
Women who accepted a coitus-independent method originally were found to be more likely to continue with the first method (59.6 per cent vs. 47.6 per cent), less likely to change from a coitus-independent to coitus-connected technique (16.5 per cent vs. 28.8 per cent), and to have relatively the same proportion of dropouts as coitus-connected acceptors (23.9 per cent vs. 23.6 per cent).

attrition rate for coitus-connected and coitus-independent methods, but fails to explore differences within the categories.
Statistical significance was found for the comparison between coitus-connected and coitus-independent methods among women who continued with the original method versus those who changed to another method. Employing Yule's Q, a moderate positive association (Q = 0.37) was found. A 95 per cent confidence interval for Q revealed an upper limit of +0.50 and a lower limit of +0.24 (P < 0.025). Thus, it was found that, while the dropout rate was not statistically significant between coitus-connected and coitus-independent methods, the proportion of changes was significant.

Thus, the data indicate the likelihood that a woman who abandons a coitus-connected method will change to a coitus-independent method, and that coitus-independent changes will be to another coitus-independent method,
DROPOUTS
An additional dimension involved the stated reason for dropping out of the family planning program. Information presented in Table 4 clearly indicate that "side effects" are the most common reason for

discontinuing. Of 314 dropouts, 113 (36.0 per cent) listed one or more side effects as a reason. Side effects included nausea, headaches, dizziness, nervousness, weight changes, high blood pressure, allergy to the pill, and multiple reasons including several items. Combining "side effects" (113) with the complaints of IUD expulsion, pain, and bleeding (17), rumors of side effects (5), and the personal evaluation of the woman that "poor health" was ^ e r r e a s o n for discontinuing a method (19), we find that health-related reasons account for nearly half (154) of all dropouts.

was pregnancy. Failure was reported by 1.4 per cent of the women who originally accepted the pill, 3 per cent of the IUD acceptors, 17.S per cent of rhythm acceptors, 21.3 per cent of withdrawal/condom users, and 13.3 per cent for "other" methods. It is evident that coitus-independent techniques rank considerably higher in method effectiveness than coitus-connected methods.
In 23 cases, the woman reported that her reason for dropping out of the program was the desire to have another child. The proportion of women who dropped out of the program was relatively the same for coitus-independent acceptors as coitusconnected acceptors (2.3 per cent vs 1.9 per cent). It is interesting to note that over one-fourth (26.8 per cent) of the women who dropped out of the program did so to bear a child. This included the 61 (19.5 per cent) with unplanned pregnancies, and the 23 (7.3 per cent) who wanted another child.
Objections by the husband to the use of a contraceptive technique were less characteristic of women who accepted a coitus-independent method than for women using coitus-connected methods. Specifically, 10 women (1.3 per cent) of all coitus-independent acceptors indicated that the reason for dropping out of the program was an objection by the husband. In all cases, the objection was to use of the pill; no IUD dropouts were reported because of objections by the husband. With coitusconnected methods, 4.2 per cent of original acceptors discontinued use because of objections by the husband. This difference might be partially explained by the more active involvement of the husband in coitus-connected methods; objections by the husband were noted for rhythm, withdrawal, and condom, but not for other methods such as diaphragm and foam. No attempt was made to ascertain the specific

reason for objections by the husband, but the possibility exists that rumors of side effects or changes in the wife's physical appearance noted by the husband subsequent to her use of the pill could have been a factor.
Failure to take the pill was reported by 15 women, or 2.4 per cent of those who accepted the pill as their first method. No attempt was made to determine reasons for failure to take the pill. Forgetfulness might serve as an explanation, but not an extremely satisfactory one since the women could have resumed pill use after an omission, or she could have changed to another method that did not require her to remember the daily pill routine. Again the possibility exists that "forgetfulness" could serve to rationalize a decision to terminate family planning when a more accurate explanation might be apprehension concerning side effects. As Rainwater (1960) stressed, stated reasons frequently serve as rationalizations that may be quite different from actual reasons. In any event, the immediate goals of the family planning program were served since failure to take the pill did not result in pregnancy.
Inconvenience of the method was reported by 6 pill acceptors, 2 rhythm acceptors, and 2 withdrawal/condom acceptors. Considered in terms of proportions, about I per cent of pill and rhythm acceptors and 2 per cent of the withdrawal/condom acceptors reported inconvenience as their reason for dropout.
Absence of the husband from the home accounted for 16 dropouts, and reaching menopause was reported by an additional II women. Neither of these reasons could be considered as directly related to acceptance of a coitus-connected or coitusindependent method. Lack of supplies accounted for only 2 dropouts and suggests that the distribution system was adequate.

including those who discontinued program involvement as a result of pregnancy, is presented in Table 5. The number of sample subjects using the pill decreased from 745 to 531, while those employing the IUD increased from 206 to 214. Respondents using the rhythm method decreased from 236 to 195, while the number practicing withdrawal or using the condom decreased from 103 to 42. Persons employing other methods decreased from 29 to 24. As a result of dropouts and pregnancies, 76 per cent of the women who entered a family planning program were practicing a method at the time of the interview. The per cent in the sample changed from 56.4 per cent to 52.7 per cent between the original method chosen and the method currently practiced. For the IUD, the percentage increased from 15.6 per cent to 21.3 per cent, while rhythm increased from 17.9 per cent to 19.4 per cent, withdrawal and condom decreased from 7.8 per cent to 4.2 per cent, and other methods showed a relatively small increase from 2.2 per cent to 2.4 per cent.
DISCUSSION
Several general observations can be made regarding findings with the population of this study:
1. Coitus-independent methods are more effective in the prevention of pregnancy than coitus-connected methods.
2. Women who change from a coitus-

connected method are more likely to change to a coitus-independent method, ·while changes from a coitus-independent technique is likely to be to another coitus-independent method. 3. The dropout rate is no greater for coitusconnected than coitus-independent methods, although the reason for dropout is different. A coitus-independent method is likely to be abandoned because of side effects, while pregnancy is the most likely reason to discontinue a coitus-connected method.
Apparently, there is a great deal of dis-
satisfaction with contraceptive techniques
made available to clients. The finding that
one-fifth of the women changed methods
and that nearly one-fourth abandoned
family planning is evidence that program
effectiveness is limited. A woman who is
dissatisfied with the method accepted at
the clinic will follow one of two courses
of action, depending upon the strength of
her motivation to participate in family
planning: (1) If sufficiently motivated,
she may change to another technique, or
(2) if motivation is weaker, she is likely
to drop out of the program. Considering
that she must have had a degree of motiva-
tion for joining the program, the concern
of program personnel is to insure that this
motivation does not diminish. However,
clinic personnel are limited by the re-
sources at their disposal. To recommend
the pill is to invite side effects that may
convince the client to change methods or

Vol. 21, No. 1

dropout; to recommend coitus-connected methods invites the possibility of method failure or resistance from the husband.
Evidence from this study indicates that for this population the IUD provides the maximum protection from conception with the minimum likelihood of program dropout. The IUD was found to have the highest retention rate and the lowest dropout rate. The major negative factor was the finding that the IUD was more associated with change than either the pill or rhythm. I t is difficult to explain the low proportion of acceptors for the IUD (i.e., less than the pill or rhythm) in the light of the more favorable results that were obtained.

An additional consideration is thepossibility of adverse publicity resulting from dissatisfaction with method. While no measure of diffusion wasincluded in the study, the apparent lack of satisfaction with methods offered could hardly be expected to be associated with the communication of favorable views on contraceptive techniques to other potential acceptors in the community.
Although coitus-independent methods hold an advantage in terms of effectiveness, the methods examined in this study fail to provide an ideal answer to the need for a contraceptive technique that is both effective and acceptable for the Philippine population.
