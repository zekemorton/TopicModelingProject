ABSTRACT: No reliable life tables for Jews appear ever to have been published before in either the United States or Canada. This study presents abridged life tables for Jews of the City of Montreal at approximately ten-year intervals over the period 1920 to 1971.For much of the half century, about one-third of the Canadian Jewish population lived in the City of Montreal. For the first thirty years of the period, the "Jewish pattern of mortality"--very low mortality up to early middle age, with relatively high mortality rates thereafter--was evident. But by the end of the 1960's, the traditional mortality pattern had disappeared. At that time, female Montreal Jews had an expectation of life at birth similar to that for Canadian women of all religions, but the comparable expectation for male Montreal Jews was higher than that for the males of any country in the world.

Several attempts have been made to construct life tables for North American Jews, but virtually all the resulting tables have been of dubious accuracy. In the United States, no questions on the religion of respondents have ever been included in the population census, so that even the numbers and age distribution of Jews in the country are not known precisely. In Canada, by contrast, the age distribution is known accurately and in detail, as information on the Jewish population, defined both by religion and by ethnicity, that is, by Jewish descent, has been collected in censuses since 1901.But statistical information on the age-specific mortality of Jews remains rare, and all of it that has been made available relates to Jews by ethnic origin. For simplicity, in the remainder of this paper, where it is necessary to distinguish between the two categorizations of Jews, those classified in terms of their religious denomination will be referred to as "Jews (R)," whereas those defined in terms of their ethnic origin will be referred to as "Jews (E)."

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Unpublished information on the mortality of Jews (E) appears to have been collected by most of the provinces between 1921 and about 1962, but little more than the total number of deaths for each sex was published. Nevertheless, Spiegelman (1948) and Fauman and Mayer (1969) were able to obtain access to some of the unpublished material, and to produce life tables for Canadian Jews (E) using the officially collected statistics.
Spiegelman's life tables were based on the age distribution at death of 505 Jews (E) who died in Ontario in 1943. Because of the small numbers involved, his estimates of the mortality rates, particularly at the younger ages, where very few deaths could have occurred, would have been subject to large sampling errors.
The life table estimates for Canadian Jews (E) published by Fauman and Mayer were calculated by W. Zayachkowski of the Dominion Bureau of Sta-

tistics, and were based on a much larger sample of deaths, consisting of three years (1960-62) of Jewish (E) mortality data for all the Canadian Provinces other than Ontario, British Columbia, and Newfoundland (Fauman and Mayer, 1969, p. 426). The numbers of deaths were compared with the age distribution of ethnic Jews in the population census for 1961 to produce the agespecific mortality rates from which the life tables were constructed. Unfortunately, however, these mortality rates were almost certainly overestimated, but to a different degree at different ages.
In the 1961 census, the number of Jews classified by ethnic origin was anomalous, even "inaccurate," in the sense that the number so defined was very different from--about one-third less than--the number of Jews defined by religious denomination. In the five censuses before 1951,the difference had always been small, approximately 1 per cent or so. The main explanation of the sudden large discrepancies in 1951 and 1961 appears to have been a change in census editing procedure.
Some editing had always been required because Jews have never fitted readily into the ethnic classification used in the census. Each census listed examples of the major ethnic groups, including Jews, but in no census was the concept of ethnicity explicitly defined. The instructions given to the enumerators in the 1951 census and in later ones suggested that, for persons in most cultural groups, ethnicity was determined largely by the language the person spoke or his nationality on arrival in Canada, or, if he were born in North America, the language or nationality of his paternal ancestor when he first came to this continent. But Jews have no common

language or nationality. So, for example, a Jew born in Poland, who was brought to live with relatives in France as a baby, and who migrated to Canada as an adult, could equally reasonably claim his ethnicity to be Polish (his nationality), or French (his language), or Jewish.
The problem was dealt with in other censuses--certainly in those of 1931, 1941, and 1971,and probably in those of 1911 and 1921--by the census editors classifying all respondents who declared their religion to be Jewish as being ethnically Jewish as well (Norland [Yam], 1974, p. 36). However, in the censuses of 1951and 1961,this procedure was not followed, with the result that over eighty thousand persons who recorded their religion as Jewish in 1961were classified in the census as being other than Jewish by origin. Moreover, the ratio of the numbers of Jews (R) to the numbers of Jews (E) varied substantially between different age groups. But we may assume that virtually all the Jews by religion who declared their ethnic origin to be nonJewish in the census, and who died in the 1950's and 1960's, would have been reported at death as being Jewish by "racial origin," the ethnic category on the registration-of-death form, by the undertaker responsible for completing the form. Typically, no more than two undertakers would arrange the burials of all Jews (R) dying within a city, even large cities such as Montreal and Toronto, and it would be more or less automatic for these undertakers to record persons buried according to Jewish religious rites as ethnic Jews.
If this were not the case, we would expect to find a sharp break in the trend of Jewish mortality rates calculated by comparing Jewish (E) deaths with Jewish (R) population in the 1950's and

1960's. But no such break was observed (see Tables 2, 3, and 4, below). Jewish mortality rates did not plummet in the 1950's and early 1960's, and then soar in 1971. They continued to decline fairly steadily throughout the period. Hence, we may conclude that the Fauman and Mayer (1969) estimates of the Canadian Jewish population at risk in the early 1960's were much too low, and that as a consequence the calculated mortality rates were much too high.
In this paper, which presents for the first time reasonably accurate life tables for Canadian Jews extending over half a century, the group principally examined are Jews from the City of Montreal. The populations at risk, in both Montreal and Canada as a whole, are based on the census figures of Jews (R), but the deaths nominally relate to Jews (E). However, for the reasons discussed above, the recorded number of deaths of Jews (E) can be assumed to be the same as the number of deaths of Jews (R), so that, in effect, all the mortality rates given in this paper can be taken to relate to Jews (R).
The numbers of deaths of Montreal Jews were obtained from the Annual Reports of the Department of Health of the City of Montreal, 1920-1971. All tests of the reliability of the statistics, including comparisons with census information, indicated that the mortality figures were reasonably accurate. In some years, the numbers of Jewish deaths in each age group were not given for each sex separately, but only for both sexes combined. In these cases, the procedure used to divide the deaths between the sexes for any given age group was to assume that the ratio of the male Jewish mortality rate to the Jewish mortality rate for both sexes combined for that age group was equal to the comparable ratio for the Canadian population

of all religions in the nearest census year. Throughout the calculations, where the age intervals in the source used did not correspond with those in the abridged life tables, the numbers in the required age intervals were estimated by cumulating the original data and using mid-panel cubic interpolation.
The population estimates for Montreal Jews (R) aged five years and above were obtained from the decennial population censuses. But young children tend to be underenumerated in censuses (Spiegelman, 1968, pp. 59-60), and they certainly were in the Canadian censuses of 1931 through 1971. In order to avoid this problem, the population of Montreal Jews under five years of age was estimated from the number of births in the previous five years.
Age-specific mortality rates relating to the census years, 1931, 1941, 1951, and 1961 were constructed by comparing the average number of deaths in each age group over thefive-yearperiod centered upon the census date with the population at risk at that date. A different procedure had to be adopted for 1921 and 1971, as in neither of those years was the age distribution of Jews in the City of Montreal published in the census. However, as the net migration of Jews into or out of the city appears to have been negligible between 1921 and 1931, the age distribution of the 1921 Jewish population could be estimated by taking account of births during the decade, and by applying reverse survival factors to the 1931 age distribution. The method proved to be remarkably accurate. The first back projection, before any subsequent adjustment, gave an estimated total Jewish male population within 0.2 per cent of the total recorded in the census.
A similar procedure could not be

that the proportional rate of net migration is the same for children under five as for children aged 5-9 years, then the population of children under five may be estimated corrected for both net migration and census underenumeration.
The procedure described above requires that the numbers of births used in the calculations should be accurate, and the numbers of male Jewish births registered in the City of Montreal appeared to be so. But in most years the numbers of female Jewish births recorded, both in the City of Montreal and in Canada as a whole, were suspiciously low. Thus, during the period 1923-51, in which Jewish (E) birth statistics for Canada were published in VitalStatistics, the average ratio of male to female live births was 1.146. For the City of Montreal over the period 1920-71, the average was 1.109. But the acceptable range of sexratios for live births is normally taken to be 1.04-1.07 (Visaria, 1967), with ratios consistently above 1.07 being strongly suggestive of biased reporting.
The explanation of the underreporting of female Jewish births in the Province of Quebec was well understood. In that province, where ministers of religion were responsible for reporting births (Bailey, 1947, p. 257), the local rabbi would quickly learn of the births of all male Jewish babies, who had to be circumcised a few days after birth. But there was no similar requirement for Jewish baby girls, and as a result, the births of female Jewish babies were less reliably reported (Kuczynski, 1930, p. 56; City of Montreal, Department of Health, 1934, pp. 278-284).
It is not clear why the births of Jewish baby girls in other provinces should so frequently have been under-reported, but there can be little doubt that underreporting was common. One implica-

tion of this finding is that estimates of Jewish fertility based directly on data from VitalStatistics will be biased downward. In an attempt to avoid similar bias, in this study, female Jewish births were assumed to be equal to 94.34 per cent (= 1/1.06) of male Jewish births in the same year.
Having obtained the lx column of the life tables, we derived the ndx, npx, and nqx values from the lx column in the usual manner. But the nLx values, being obtained by integrating the theoretical l(x) curve associated with the observed lx values, can be calculated in a number of ways. For ages under five, the nLx values were in fact obtained by integrating the hyperbola that was fitted iteratively to the IQ, h and /5 values. For ages between 5 and 64 years, where the ageintervals on both sides of the interval for which nLx was calculated were of five years, the l(x) curve was assumed to be approximated by a series of cubic arcs, the equation used to obtain the nLx values being that given by Greville (1943, Equation (14), p. 40). For ages between 65 and 89 years, where the age intervals were not of uniform width, the seconddegree equation used to obtain nLx was that given by Greville (1943, at the top of p. 42). For the open-ended age interval, 90 years and over, Lgo was taken to be equal to /» / M».
Having obtained the nLx columns, we derived the remaining columns in the life table, ,,Tx and ex, in the usual way.

AGE PATTERN OF MORTALITY
A number of authors comparing Jewish mortality with that of non-Jews in the same country in the first half of this century have commented on the remarkably consistent pattern found (Ruppin, 1934, pp. 85-90; Spiegelman, 1948; Seidman et al., 1962; Goldstein, 1966; Fauman and Mayer, 1969). The profile

of age-specific mortality observed was so consistent that we may call it, the "Jewish pattern of mortality." Typically, infant and childhood mortality rates for Jews would be very much lower than the national mortality rates, often less than half, forthe same age groups. The relatively favorable rates ofJewish mortality would continue into early middle age, but then, in the 40's or 50's, the

Jewish rate would increase rapidly, overtake that of the non-Jews, and remain above the gentile mortality rates at all higher ages.
Some evidence of this pattern among Jews in the City of Montreal is shown in Table 3.
The characteristic pattern persisted for both male and female Jews, though becoming less pronounced over time, until about the early 1950's, as can be seen in the bottom third of the table. Jewish mortality rates up to that time were much lower than those of Canadians in general for all age groups below 40, and higher for all age groups above 40. So few were the deaths among Jews under 40 that, even though death rates were based on five-years experience, the mortality rates were subject to appreciable sampling variability.
Mortality rates tended to fall more rapidly throughout the fifty-year period for Jews than for non-Jews, particularly among males, so that by the early 1960's, male Jews had better survival chances than male non-Jews in all age groups. Among females, the traditional pattern persisted longer. Whereas among Jews, female mortality rates for all age groups fell more rapidly than those of males, among non-Jews the gap between the mortality rates for the two sexes widened even more dramatically. As a consequence, the traditional Jewish mortality pattern was still faintly evident among females even as late as the beginning of the 1960's. But by the end of the 1960s, for both male and female Canadian Jews, the pattern had disappeared. It appears, however, that something of the pattern still lingered in at least one Jewish community in the United States into the 1980's (Goldstein, 1986, pp. 89-90).
Nobody has ever been able to estab-

lish a satisfactory explanation of the traditional pattern, largely because in those countries where the pattern was found little information on the causes of death of Jews was available (though, see Ruppin, 1934, pp. 88-94). The Annual Reports of the Department of Health of the City of Montreal do contain some material on this topic, but unfortunately, neither the cause-of-death categories nor the age groups distinguished are sufficiently fine to enable us to test any of the more promising explanatory hypotheses. In particular, no information on causes of death of the different ethnic groups was published for the critical adult age groups--the open-ended age group in the annual reports related to persons over five years old.
Whatever the cause of the traditional mortality pattern, it is clear that the explanation could not have been occupational, since Jewish men had much the same pattern of mortality by age as Jewish women, but a very different occupational distribution. Nor is it likely, as suggested by Spiegelman, (1948, p. 301), that the very much lower mortality rates at younger ages for Jews in itself brought about higher mortality later in life by merely postponing the deaths of impaired persons from youth to middle age. If that had been a major part of the explanation, we would expect that the later cohorts, with the lowest mortality in the youthful age groups, would have had the highest rates in middle age; that is, that the traditional pattern would have become more pronounced over time. But, in fact, as we have seen, the reverse occurred.
A plausible, though regrettably vague, hypothesis would seek to explain the phenomenon in terms of changes in the Jewish way of life. The suggestion is that the traditional Jewish way of life as

practiced in Europe and North America in the first half of the century led to high mortality in late middle age, possibly from one or more of the degenerative diseases. Then, after the Second World War, as the Jews in the Western world, including those in the City of Montreal, came to behave more like their neighbors, particularly in their dietary habits, so the pattern of their mortality rates became more like that of the non-Jews about them.
EXPECTATION OFLIFE
Table 4 shows the expectation of life at selected ages of Montreal Jews and of Canadians of all religions over the fifty year period.
The differences between the Jewish experience and that of all Canadians are

striking. The great improvement that occurred between the early 1920's and the late 1960's in middle-age mortality for Montreal Jewish males is shown by the increase in expectation of life at age 40 of almost seven years between those years. In contrast, over the same period the expectation of life for the average Canadian male at the same age increased by less than a year. But it was the Montreal Jewish males who were unusual; the experience of the middleaged Canadian males was comparable with that of men of similar age in many other industrialized countries throughout the period, particularly in the years since about 1950 (see, United Nations, 1982, pp. 17-18).
