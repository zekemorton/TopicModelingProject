ABSTRACT:The purpose of this study is to determine how children's health conditions are related to their mothers' risk of divorce or separation. The study is based on data from over 7,000 children born to once-married mothers identified in the 1988 Child Health Supplement to the National Health Interview Survey. The effects of 15 childhood health conditions on the mothers' risk of divorce are estimated with Cox's proportional hazard models. Controlling for demographic, marital, and reproductive measures, we find that mothers' prospects for divorce are affected both positively or negatively by their children's health status, depending on the type of childhood condition and, in the case of low birth weight children, timing within the marriage. Women whose children have congenital heart disease, cerebral palsy, are blind, or had low birth weight appear to have higher risks of marital disruption than mothers of healthy children. In contrast, mothers whose children have migraines, learning disabilities, respiratory allergies, missing/deformed digits or limbs, or asthma have somewhat lower rates of divorce.

Two questions about children's health and their mothers' risk of marital disruption are addressed in this study. First, do mothers of children with specific serious or permanent health problems have higher or lower risks of divorce than mothers with healthier children? Second, is the relationship between divorce and children's health status explained by factors associated with both the risk of marital disruption and the onset of serious childhood health conditions?
The two questions are motivated by concerns about family well-being. The impact of illness on families has long been a policy consideration. Usually, these effects are described in terms of medical expenditures. What is less clear, yet potentially as catastrophic, is how family cohesion is affected when a child has a serious health condition. Growing evidence on the negative effects of divorce on children (Amato, 1993) raises particular concern in this context. If di-

vorce rates are higher than expected among couples with children in poor health, then the longer-term adverse consequences of a child's poor health may be exacerbated, especially for severe conditions. Alternatively, the presence of a child in poor health may strengthen the couple's resolve to care for the child and thereby reduce their chances of divorce. Current knowledge about the relationship between children's health status and their parents' risk of divorce is limited.
Generally, the risk of divorce varies by the number, ages, and timing of children. Marital stability is greatest when children are young and their total number is moderate (i.e., two to three children). Marital stability tends to be lower among couples with five or more children (Heaton, 1990). Older or premaritally-born children increase the chances of divorce for first marriages (Martin and Bumpass 1989; Waite and Lillard, 1991;Wineberg, 1988). In contrast, the likelihood of divorce decreases

the longer a woman waits to have her first child (Wineberg, 1988). This relationship has not changed for marriage cohorts since 1960, but the risk of divorce has generally increased across marriage cohorts for any marital duration (Chadwick andHeaton, 1992).
The evidence on divorce rates among parents of children with serious health conditions is mixed. While studies from the 1970's reported high divorce rates among parents of chronically ill children (Finley et al., 1979; Gath, 1977; Lansky et al., 1978; Martin, 1978; Tew et al., 1974), most of the recent research found no significant difference in the divorce rate of couples with seriously ill children compared to couples in the general population (Hauenstein, 1990; Longo and Bond, 1984; McCubbin, 1989; Sabbeth and Leventhal, 1984; Yura, 1987). Much of this past work, however, does not control for potential confounders such as the presence and number of other children, or the timing of a child's birth within the life course of the marriage (Finley et al., 1979; Gath, 1977; Hauenstein, 1990; Lansky et al., 1978; Longo and Bond, 1984; Martin, 1978; McCubbin, 1989; Palfrey et al., 1989; Sabbeth and Leventhal, 1984; Silben et al., 1982; Tew et al., 1974; Yura, 1987). Past work has also generally relied on small, cross-sectional, convenience samples.
Exceptions are recent studies by Corman and Kaestner (1992) and Mauldon (1992). Based on the large, nationally representative 1981 and 1988 Child Health Supplements to the National Health Interview Surveys, both conclude that an unhealthy child decreases the mother's likelihood of being married. The study reported here complements theirs by focusing on specific health conditions (e.g., blindness, cerebral palsy), instead of more subjective or broadly defined health measures (e.g., "disabled").

While subjective measures of a child's health status are useful in that they represent a summary of the parent's view of the child's condition, such measures tend to be based on circumstances at the time of the survey rather than over the duration of the condition'. These summary measures may also be limited by social desirability effects and recall bias, and colored by the respondent's marital status at the time the data are collected (Angel and Woreby, 1988). Other broadly-defined measures, such as total number of physical health conditions, may mask the range of marital effects experienced by parents, since milder and more severe conditions are treated equivalently.
An analysis of divorce rates by health conditions raises the question whether specific conditions have inherent effects on the divorce risk. It is not suggested here that this is the case, but rather that more serious conditions may impact marital quality differently than less serious conditions. While it would be preferable to work with measures that assess directly how the quality of a marriage is affected by the severity of a child's health problems, in the absence of such information, different health conditions are used as indirect indicators.
CHILD HEALTH AND THE RISK OF DIVORCE
The question remains why marriages may be more or less stable when a sick child is present, and why some conditions may create stronger effects than others. The literature suggests a number of mechanisms that can lead to positive as well as negative changes in family dynamics.
Two theoretical perspectives predict that marriages with seriously ill children have higher divorce rates than those with healthy children. First, Friedman et al.

(1994) argue that the "uncertainty reduction principle" leads us to engage in behaviors that are likely to reduce uncertainty about the future. While marriage in general is a strategy for reducing uncertainty, "the instability of marriages is yet another source of uncertainty" (Friedman et al., 1994, p. 383). Some childhood chronic health conditions are so severe and permanent (e.g., cerebral palsy or congenital heart disease) that they are likely to introduce challenges and stresses to the family that can destabilize a marriage, increasing parents' uncertainty about the future and thereby the probability that the partner who expects to be the noncustodial parent after the break-up seeks a divorce. For conditions that are more episodic, not as severe, and may disappear after some time (e.g., migraines, allergies), parents can be realistically optimistic that the child will improve and that they can be active players in helping their child. The uncertainty reduction principle predicts that parents in this latter group will have divorce rates similar to parents of healthy children.
Second, within economics and sociology, some suggest that children represent "marital-specific capital." Children as marital-specific capital increase the net gain from marriage, enhancing marital stability (Waite and Lillard, 1991; Becker et al., 1977). If a child is less able to meet parental expectations (e.g., diminished parental enjoyment and pride), then the child's marital-specific capital is lower than anticipated, leading to a lower than expected gain from the marital relationship and a higher divorce risk.
Alternatively, increased parental concern about the adverse effects of divorce on a child with a chronic condition may enhance rather than reduce marital stability. Prevailing social norms encourage

couples with children to stay together more than childless couples, and these expectations may be even higher for parents of special-needs children.
Some perspectives suggest both positive and negative marital consequences when seriously ill children are present. Children with special needs are likely to increase their parents' emotional and financial strain. While the same could be said for any marriage with children, the difference with unhealthy children is the prospect of long-term hardships stemming from additional medical and social support costs (Birenbaum et al., 1990). On the other hand, these additional costs, including the possibility of losing health insurance (Berk and Taylor, 1984), could increase the financial burden of single parenthood to such an extent that a divorce becomes unattractive to the likely custodial parent.
The added time needed to raise a child with special needs can be considerable. Marriages may be strengthened by either increasing the specialization of roles (one parent is the primary caregiver while the other is the primary breadwinner) (Traustadottir, 1991), or through more equal role-sharing (both parents share in both roles). However, a parent's role as caregiver can be over-specialized to the point where it has a negative effect on their marriage (Pearlin and Turner, 1987).
In summary, theoretical perspectives suggest that a sick child may have a stabilizing or destabilizing effect on the parents' marriage.

examined with the Child Health Supplement to the 1988 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS-CH). The NHIS is an annual nationwide household survey of the civilian noninstitutionalized U.S. population. The 1988 NHIS-CH was administered to NHIS sample households with at least one child under age 18 (Dawson, 1991). Within these households, one child was sampled at random, providing information for 17,110 children between the ages of 0 and 17. The survey was conducted with the adult family member who knew "most about health related matters" of the sample child, typically the mother.
In selecting the subsample for this study, the following criteria were applied. First, the sample child had to be born while the biological parents were married to each other. Second, the biological mother had to be married only once; the questionnaire was structured such that marital history information was ambiguous otherwise. Third, at the time of the interview, the sample child had to live with the biological mother. Too few children of divorced families were living with biological fathers to conduct a meaningful analysis of this group. Fourth, the onset of the sample child's health condition had to occur while their parents were married and over one year before the divorce or interview date. Conditions beginning during the year prior to a divorce may be the result of the impending divorce rather than a contributing cause.
For sample size reasons, divorces and separations were combined into one category. The two marital states will be referred to as "divorced" for the remainder the paper.
MODEL AND VARIABLE DESCRIPTION
One way in which the effect of a child's health could be assessed is by in-

vestigating its impact on marital quality. In the absence of such data, indicators of specific health conditions provide indirect measures of the variety of psychosocial and economic challenges introduced into the family. Accordingly, children's health conditions were selected from the NHISCH to range in severity and permanency and to be less likely subject to recall bias with respect to the occurrence and the onset dates of these conditions. The latter is particularly important for a divorced mother who is recalling her child's health when the marriage was intact (Dawson, 1991). Drawing on Newacheck and Taylor (1992), the conditions examined here are missing or deformed limbs/back/hands/ feet, severe headaches or migraines, allergies, asthma, deafness, speech defects, blindness, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, congenital heart disease, low birth weight, developmental delays, learning disabilities, and emotional/behavior problems.
Divorce hazard rates are analyzed with Cox' proportional hazard regression models. Each health condition is entered as a dummy variable into its own regression. In contrast to earlier studies, standard errors for parameters in the regression models are estimated with SUDAAN 6.0 software (Shah et al., 1993) to account for the complex NHIS-CH sample design. In addition, all results are weighted to reflect national population estimates.
The divorce hazard rate is defined as the probability of divorce at time t, given the couple is still married just prior to /. For children who remain free of the selected health conditions ("healthy" group), Ì = 0 at the sample child's birth. Children who become ill have two parts to their lives: the portions before and after the onset of the health condition. While children are healthy, they are con-

sidered part of the "healthy" group. The portion of the child's record that occurs after the disease is apparent is part of the "ill" group. For this group, t = 0 at the onset of the condition.
For marriages still intact in 1988, marital duration is censored at the time of the interview. Marriages ending through spousal death are censored at the time of widowhood.
Several covariates are included in the model to address possible confounding. The arrival of children, healthy or otherwise, may affect marital quality differently depending upon the stage of the marriage. Generally, when children are born into relatively new marriages, parents are more likely to experience divorce than when children are born into older marriages (Wineberg, 1988). Apart from access to greater socioeconomic resources, older marriages are more stable than younger ones because most unhappy marriages have already dissolved during the early years of marriage. The "length of marriage at t = 0" covariate adjusts for differences in the duration of marriages at the time of birth/disease onset.
It is possible that there is an interaction effect between the onset of the health condition and the duration of the marriage, that is, the effect may differ depending on whether the child is born earlier or later in the marriage. To address this possibility, the analysis distinguishes whether a low versus normal birth weight child is born within the first two years of the marriage or afterwards. The limited number of cases for many health conditions did not allow a more detailed investigation of this issue.
The model further includes a measure of whether the child was born less than eight months into the marriage. Women

who marry while pregnant may bear a child who is at higher risk for health problems due to the stressful nature of the marriage and the decreased likelihood of adequate prenatal care. These marriages are also at higher risk of divorce (Wineberg, 1988).
Health problems of other family members may affect marital stability as well. For other family members the NHIS does not provide information on the dates of disease onset beyond 12 months prior to the interview. To consider the relationship between family members' health and marital stability indirectly, the analysis controls whether the mother or any sibling is unable to perform major activities at the time of the interview. Being unable to perform one's major activity is most likely the result of an ongoing chronic condition that preceded rather than followed a divorce.
Additionally, the model contains maternal measures of the mother's age at marriage, her education, whether she is African American, whether she had a child premaritally, the birth order of the sample child, and her marriage cohort. Previous studies indicate that these factors are related to the risk of divorce (White, 1990).
Other measures of socioeconomic status in the NHIS-CH that may be relevant for a divorce analysis pertain to conditions at the time of the interview rather than the time of the child's birth or the marriage. If these measures could be the consequence of the child's health status or the divorce rather than precursor, they were not used. For respondents who were divorced by the interview date, no data were collected on the child's father while the marriage was intact. Accordingly, no father data were included in the analysis.

Table 1 shows descriptive statistics for the covariates. The covariates are used to estimate adjusted hazard rates.
RESULTS
Table 2 lists parameter estimates, unadjusted and adjusted hazard rate ratios (RR), and their 95 per cent confidence limits derived from Cox regression models for 15 health conditions. The results are arranged from smallest to largest effect. The RR's are based on comparisons between the divorce hazard rates among women whose children have selected health conditions and the divorce hazard rate for women with children in the "healthy" group (i.e., the children who are or were free of the 15 health conditions). The unweighted number of children with a given health condition and the number whose mothers experienced a divorce are listed in the last two columns of Table 2.
Marriages with children who have congenital heart disease, cerebral palsy, or who are blind have divorce rates that are 2 to 3 times higher than those with healthy children. However, marriages with children who have migraines, a learning disability, or a respiratory allergy have significantly lower rates of divorce. Mothers of children who have asthma or a permanent deformity or loss of limbs/digits also have somewhat lower divorce rates.
The results presented in Table 3 show that women who had a low birth weight child were more likely to get divorced than women whose child had a normal birth weight if the birth occurred in the first two years of the marriage rather than later.
The effects of the control variables (available upon request) generally support findingsof other recent longitudinal studies

(Heaton, 1990; Waite and Lillard, 1991). Mothers who are African American, had a premarital birth, give birth to the sample child at a young age, marry while pregnant, are members of recent marriage cohorts, and are unable to perform major activities are more likely to divorce than mothers without these characteristics.
DISCUSSION
This paper explores the effects of children's health conditions on their mothers' risk of divorce. Two questions were raised for which preliminary answers are provided. First, we found that mothers of children with serious or permanent health problems have both higher and lower risks of divorce than mothers of healthier children, depending upon the condition. Second, these relationships are not necessarily explained by confounding factors that may affect both the risk of divorce and the onset of the health conditions. After controlling for demographic, marital, and reproductive measures in addition to proxies for mothers' and siblings' health, the same health conditions had similar effects (positive or negative) on the risk of divorce.
It is recognized that condition-specific analyses may incorrectly attribute effects of one condition to another if they occur together. For example, low birth weight children are at greater risk of experiencing severe health conditions including blindness, deafness, congenital heart disease, and cerebral palsy (Miller et al., 1989). A model that examined the effects of these health conditions and controlled for low birth weight (not shown) found insignificant effects for deafness and cerebral palsy and significant effects for blindness and congenital heart disease similar to those reported in Table 2.

Given the rarity of some of the health conditions considered here, analyzing them separately may make it more difficult to detect moderate effects. The estimates for epilepsy and deafness, for example, are based on a small number of cases and while neither estimate is signif-

icant, the magnitude of these effects is not trivial, suggesting that the risk of divorce may be affected by these conditions. As indicated in the introduction, examining summary indices of health instead (Corman and Kaestner, 1992; Mauldon, 1992) has its own limitations.

As an alternative, one could use information about the mother's assessment of how her child is affected by the condition as an indirect measure of its impact on the mother's marriage. The NHIS-CH reports the mothers' perceptions of how much each condition "bothers" the child during the past year and the limitations it imposes on the child's "daily activities." Newacheck and Taylor (1992) show, for

example, that for all mothers (married or not), frequent headaches or ear infections generate more "bother" to the child than heart disease or cerebral palsy. On the other hand, cerebral palsy limits the child's "usual activity" more than frequent ear infections, with heart disease and frequent headaches both having intermediate effects. These findings suggest that the relationship between a particular

Vol. 44, No. 3-4

childhood chronic health condition and the mother's perception is complex, but also that these measures are imperfect because the mother was not asked to name specific reasons as to why she perceives her child's condition the way she does. A further problem is that some assessments were obtained after a divorce.
A potential limitation of this study is its reliance on a modest number of variables measured at or prior to the child's birth. Using the variables listed in Table 1 ensures that their values are not the result of the child's birth or health conditions. Another concern is the possibility of reverse causation, whereby a child's health status may be the result of the parents' low marital quality. While this argument does not apply to the observed protective effects, it is also not likely to explain the findings for blindness and congenital heart disease. To examine the reverse causation scenario fully, future studies need to secure more information about the marriage prior to the birth, including measures of marital quality and access to prenatal care.
Another possible limitation of the study is its sample. As noted, women who remarried after their divorce had to be excluded from the analysis. If mothers with healthy children are more likely to remarry in the general population, then their divorce rate in the sample is lower than the true divorce rate. For health conditions that are associated with lower divorce rates, our results thus underestimate the real difference in the divorce rates between the "healthy" and "unhealthy" groups and hence are conservative. However, since the remarriage rate among mothers with young children tends to be low overall, any bias in the results is likely to be small.

Two other sources of biases may influence the results, although steps were taken to minimize or identify their effects. First, divorced mothers may report more health problems than married mothers (Angel and Woreby, 1988). This finding would suggest more reportedly ill children among divorced families. Overreporting of childhood illness among divorced mothers is unlikely to be a problem for the protective effects observed here. Second, if marriages with seriously ill children comprise a disproportionate share of bad marriages (where the quality of marriages is unobservable), one would expect a higher divorce rate for this group and one could have argued for reverse causation. Instead, protective effects were found for several conditions, while two to three adverse effects were observed for conditions that are unlikely to be the result of bad marriages.
In closing, it is important to emphasize that this study is based on a nationally representative sample of children in 1988. The children in this analysis had to be alive to be part of the sample (a feature of the NHIS-CH). As a result, children with some of the most severe health conditions were more likely to have died and were thereby excluded from the sample. This study is, therefore, not in a position to discuss the impact of infant or child mortality on the marriage of surviving parents. In this light, the findings are probably conservative.
These initial analyses indicate the importance of children's health for the stability of their mothers' marriages. If some children's illnesses are more likely to hasten the demise of marriages by contributing to family stress, it will be important to determine whether the children's health status declines further during the

post-divorce years. It will also be important to identify characteristics of marriages that do not dissolve despite the potential stresses encountered from the children's medical conditions and whether there is an interaction effect for the onset of a health condition relative to the duration of the marriage.
