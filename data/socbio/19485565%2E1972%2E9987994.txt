The research available concerning the phenomenon of childlessness is very limited, especially when compared with the voluminous literature which has been directed toward other facets of human reproduction. When the occurrence of childlessness is considered, a variable assumed to be of primary importance is the issue of causation. In discussing the causes of infertility, it is traditional to distinguish at the onset between "voluntary" and "involuntary" childlessness (Pohlman, 1970). This dichotomy implicitly assumes an incongruence between child-bearing motivation and child-bearing capacity. Voluntarily childless couples are assumed to be fertile, but not inclined towards parenthood; involuntarily childless couples are assumed to want children, but to be unable to have them.
Although the theoretical implications of the distinction between voluntary and involuntary childlessness are manifold, the practical application of the dichotomy is very difficult. In order to place individuals in the appropriate category, it is necessary to know details concerning not only their health, but also their innermost motivations and aspirations. Such data can be gleaned

only in intensive personal interviews and are not readily available for representative samples of large populations. As a result, it is not surprising that research directly concerned with assessing voluntary and involuntary motivations for childlessness is rare (Popenoe, 1936; Kiser, 1939; Popenoe, 1943; Whelpton and Kiser, 1950). Most of the data on childlessness are collected incidentally during research overtly concerned with other themes.
Some information is available from census materials which can provide reliable factual information concerning the sociodemographic characteristics of women who do not become mothers (Harrington, unpublished). However, such materials do not provide any direct information regarding causation. Thus, although Grabill and Glick (1959, p. 60) acknowledge that "data on voluntary or involuntary childlessness are . . . one aspect of comprehensive demographic investigations," their own analysis of American census data makes no attempt to unravel the causes of childlessness. Information concerning childlessness is also available incidentally in the largescale American fertility studies, based on

interviews with representative samples of American women (Whelpton and Kiser, 19S0; Freedman, Whelpton, and Campbell, 1959; Whelpton, Campbell, and Patterson, 1966). Although the samples involved are large and carefully drawn, they do not compare in size or comprehensiveness with samples from the census itself.
The dilemma involved in a perfectly comprehensive description of childlessness lies in the desire on the one hand to utilize very large and comprehensive samples such as are available through the use of census materials, and the need on the other hand to involve respondents in detailed and expensive personal interviews in order to establish adequately whether a particular incident of childlessness is voluntary or involuntary. It is suggested that although the latter kind of information is undoubtedly invaluable for the clinical assessment and counselling of individual couples, it may be superfluous for purposes of demographic analysis. From the demographers viewpoint, it is suggested that a more heuristic approach to the problem may be to differentiate childlessness not in terms of intentional-unintentional, but in terms of childlessness which is due mainly to physiological factors, and childlessness which is due mainly to psychological factors. It is the contention of the present research that if such a change in orientation is made, it becomes possible to utilize census data to estimate the relative importance of physiological and psychological factors in the etiology of childlessness. The problem of the present research is to apply this perspective to the analysis of data from a 20% sample of the 1961 Canadian census1
1 The 1961 Dominion Bureau of Statistics Census of Canada includes a 20% sample on Migration, Fertility, and Income, which provides information on the number of children who have ever been born to over four million Canadian women who have ever been married. These data are subject to at least two limitations. First, be-

and to thereby estimate the incidence of psychological childlessness among urban Canadian women.
PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CHILDLESSNESS
The many possible causes of childlessness can be usefully classified into two main groups: physiological factors and psychological factors. Physiological factors are those which contribute to some specific physical abnormality or malfunction of the reproductive organs and so lead to the sterility of the husband and/or wife. Such damage may result from congenital defects, traumatic injuries, disruptive diseases (such as venereal diseases or mumps), impairment of the reproductive process during surgical procedure, or a variety of other circumstances. Estimates of the incidence of sterility vary, depending upon the operational definitions used,2 but it is generally felt that about 10% of all couples are definitely sterile. For example, Thomlinson (1965, p. 48) states: "About one-third of all couples in the United States appear to be subfecund, and approximately ten percent are definitely sterile, that is, they seem
cause statistics refer only to the parity of wives, only very cautious generalizations can be made concerning childless husbands or childless couples. Second, no information is available on marital history. Presumably, some of the childlessness among ever-married women can be attributed to the absence of the husband for some or all of the fecund years, due to separation, desertion, divorce, or death.
2 The idea of sterility has been used in a number of ways in demographic literature. At least two dimensions are commonly involved. In terms of duration, sterility may refer to a lifetime inability to have children or, at a particular time in life, the inability to have any more children. In terms of degree, sterility may refer to being absolutely sterile, with no possibility of having children; to being probably sterile, with little chance of having children; or to being subfecund, with a below average probability of having children. For the purposes of the present research, sterility will be used to refer to those situations where it is certain or almost certain that a woman has never had a child and will never be able to have one.

totally incapable of having children." He later extends this estimate to refer also to Canada as a whole (1965, p. 157) Whelpton, Campbell, and Patterson (1966, p. 163) conclude: "If fecundity impairments had been the sole cause of childlessness, the proportion of couples with no children would have been between nine and thirteen percent."
Psychological factors are those which lead to the infertility of the husband and/ or wife, although there are no apparent physical reasons why reproduction does not occur. Psychological factors may be manifest in two different but related ways, as psychosomatic infertility, or as voluntary childlessness. The processes involved in psychosomatic infertility are not clearly understood, but for at least some people psychic strain, tension, or the intense desire to avoid parenthood, apparently can interfer with the reproductive process. No estimates are available of the probable incidence of psychosomatic infertility. Voluntary childlessness involves the absence of children due to the deliberate decision by the husband and/or wife not to have any children, and to use birth control and/or induced abortion to prevent any live births.
In practical terms, it is very difficult to separate psychosomatic infertility from voluntary childlessness, and the attempt to do so lends itself readily to a variety of speculations. For example, the same socialpsychological factors which contribute to voluntary childlessness may very well contribute to psychosomatic infertility as well, rendering elaborate birth control measures superfluous. Some women who claim they want to conceive may be unconsciously rejecting pregnancy and motherhood, and those unconscious processes may affect their fecundity. In Riser's study of 300 never-pregnant women, about 15% of those who sought medical help in becoming pregnant were told there was "no apparent

reason" why they did not conceive (Riser, 1939).
Although early studies suggested that of all childless couples, between one-half and one-third were childless by choice (Popenoe, 1936; Riser, 1939; Popenoe, 1943; Whelpton and Riser, 1950), recent data suggest that almost all childlessness is due to sterility. Riser hypothesizes that the lower the incidence of childlessness in a population, the lower the proportion of all childlessness which is deliberate (Riser, 1959). In the opinion of many population and family life experts, as the rates of childlessness have declined, voluntary childlessness has virtually disappeared. For example, Thomlinson (1965, p. 148) concludes: "Almost all couples who say that they expect to be childless are biologically subfecund; voluntary childlessness is very rare in the United States today." Martinson (1970, p. 314) reflects a ubiquitous opinion among scholars when he states flatly: "The desire for children is nearly universal. Marriages childless by choice are practically nonexistent." Bell (1971, p. 417) comments: "High positive values about having children are accepted by the vast majority of Americans, and the majority of childless couples are not that way by choice." Williamson (1966, p. 430) notes that although women may vary in the number of children they prefer: "In reality, few women reject the idea of children altogether."
ESTIMATE OF THE MAXIMUM INCIDENCE
OF PHYSIOLOGICAL CHILDLESSNESS
In a population with very high positive values on fertility, it can be assumed that almost all of the childlessness which occurs will be due to physiological factors. It is suggested that the minimum rates of childlessness in a high fertility population provide a useful estimate of the maximum possible rates of physiological childlessness

of women in urban Canada. This is assumed to affect the incidence of voluntary childlessness at least two ways. First, Catholics generally desire more children than non-Catholics. Given the Church's

270

teaching that an intentionally childless
marriage is not valid in the sight of God,
it is unlikely that a Catholic wife would
consider childlessness an ideal state (Pohl-
man, 1970, p. 7). Second, the Catholic
taboos on birth control and abortion are
stricter than non-Catholic restrictions. Even
in the improbable event that a rural Catho-
lic wife would prefer to avoid motherhood,
her ability to successfully control all of her
own fertility is exceedingly doubtful.
As would be expected, the rates of child-
lessness among rural farm women in Quebec do prove to be remarkably low.4 Since age
at first marriage is known to affect the
incidence of childlessness (Veevers, 1971)
and since women in rural Quebec do tend
to marry younger than their urban counterparts,5 the minimum rates of childlessness
were calculated controlling for age at first
marriage. Since, even in Quebec, the rates
of childlessness do vary slightly over time,
it is possible that some of the childlessness
is due to psychological factors. However,
what is important for the present purposes
is that the rate of physiological sterility
could not be more than the entire rate of
childlessness, and as such the rates for rural
farm Quebec can be taken as maximum
estimates of physiological childlessness.
4 The rates of childlessness among women in rural farm Quebec are comparable to the lowest reported in the literature. For example, Grabill and Glick report that the most extreme case they could find in a survey of the American census for 1910, 1940, 19S0, and 1957 was for women over 40 years of age in 1910 who were born in Russia and Poland. Among this group, the lowest rate was 2.3%, and the average was about 3% of aged women ever married. The lowest reported rate for women born in North America was found among women in Utah who were from SO to 74 years of age in 1910, of whom only 4.5% were childless (Grabill and Glick 1959, pp. 62-63).
5 In urban Canada, the distribution of age at first marriage is as follows: 26.6% are married from 15 to 19; 46.5% from 20 to 24; 17.7% from 25 to 29; 5.3% from 30 to 34; and 3.9% at 35 or older. In comparison, women in rural farm Quebec tend to marry younger. There, 29.0% are married from 15 to 19; 49.5% from 20 to 24; 16.2% from 25 to 29; 4.7% from 30 to 34; and only 0.7% at age 35 or older.

These rates are given in Column 4 of Tables
1 and 2.
Another group ideally suited for this
kind of comparison are Hutterite women.
The Hutterite way of life combines a rural
background and a desire for large families
with early marriage and absolutely no birth
control or abortion. One could discount com-
pletely the possibility of voluntary child-
lessness and could expect that psycho-
somatic sterility would be rare. It has been
estimated that among Hutterite women
ever-married, the incidence of childlessness
is less than 3% (Whelpton, Campbell, and
Patterson, 1966, p. 164).
ESTIMATE OF THE MINIMUM INCIDENCE
OF PSYCHOLOGICAL CHILDLESSNESS
To estimate the extent of psychological
childlessness among urban Canadian women
past childbearing years, the following steps
were taken, as shown in Table 1 and 2.
1. For each age at first marriage, the number of urban women (Column 2) and the percentage of urban women who remain childless (Column 3) was calculated from census data
2. For each age at first marriage, the lowest recorded percentages of childlessness among rural farm women in Quebec were selected as indicating the maximum percentage of childlessness due to physiological reasons (Column 4).
3. These percentages were applied to the number of urban women to obtain an estimate of the number of urban women childless due to physiological reasons (Column S).
4. The minimum percentage of childlessness due to psychological reasons was obtained by subtracting the percentage due to physiological reasons from the percentage of all childlessness (Column 6).
5. These percentages were applied to the number of urban women to obtain an estimate of the number of urban women childless due to psychological reasons (Column 7).
6. The estimates of number of urban women childless due to physiological reasons were compared with the estimates of the number of women childless due to

psychological reasons to obtain an index of the relative importance of the two factors (Column 8).
CONCLUSIONS
An examination of the child-bearing patterns of Canadian women indicates that, as the general incidence of childlessness has declined (from 15.2% for women over 45 to only 10.8% for women aged 30 to 44), the estimated incidence of physiological childlessness has declined as well, from 6.6% to 4.6%. Since some of the younger women may still bear at least one child before the onset of the menopause, this incidence may actually decline still further.6 Among the factors which have probably been influential in effecting this change are the declining age at first marriage, the general improvement in the treatment of subfecundity problems, and the overall improvement in health standards.
The incidence of sterility in the population is often estimated at about 10% of all couples. The data presented suggest that this figure is much too high and that a more realistic estimate would be about 5% or less. Although similar low estimates have been previously mentioned in the
6 Although it is theoretically possible for a nullipara over the age of 30 to bear a child, it is very unlikely. For example, the rate of first births of women aged 30-34 is 6.6 per 1000, compared with 7S.3per 1000for women aged 20-24. Bythe age 35-39, the rate has dropped to 2.2 per 1000, and by the ages 40-44 it almost disappears at only 0.5 (Natality Statistics Analysis, 1970, p.13).

literature (Kuczynski, 1938, p. 359; Mitra, 1966, p. 134; Bogue, 1969, p.725), the discrepancy between them and the common assertion of 10% has engendered little comment.
The incidence of voluntary childlessness also appears to be declining, in spite of the many common sense arguments as to why it might be expected to increase. Among post-menopausal women, an estimated 8.6% of those ever-married did not become mothers as a result of psychological factors; among younger women ages 30 to 44, the comparable percentage is estimated to be only about 6.2%. However, contrary to Riser's hypothesis (1959, p. 4928) the relative incidence of the causes of childlessness has not substantially changed. Although childlessness has declined, the estimated proportion of childlessness due to psychological factors has remained relatively constant at slightly more than 50% (Col. 8, Tables 1 and 2). Given the fact that psychological childlessness apparently accounts for at least half of the childlessness of ever-married women over the age of 30, it seems premature to presume, as Tomasson (1966, p. 328) and others have, that a "virtual disappearance of deliberate childlessness" has already occurred.
