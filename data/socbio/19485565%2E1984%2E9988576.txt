ABSTRACT: The central issue of this analysis is whether the relationship between modernization and fertility is isomorphic across different parities. Results from bivariate and multivariate analyses of the 32 states of Mexico in 1970 reveal parity differentials in the relationship between modernization and fertility. In general, at the bivariate level, significant inverse relationships are obtained between modernization indicators and parities 5 and above. However, at the lower parities both negative and positive, and mostly insignificant results are obtained. Regression analyses reveal that indeed a model based strictly on socioeconomic development is less robust at lower parities, and particularly robust for middle-range parities. In both bivariate and multivariate analyses, the relationship between an aggregated measure of fertility, the average number of children ever born per woman, and modernization appears to be weakened by the mixed and indeterminant behavior of lower parities in response to modernization. We suggest that these mixed and indeterminant results at the lower end of the parity continuum are due to the combined and opposite effects of modernization on subfecundity and social behavior.

There is little doubt that fertility transitions over time and differentials at one point in time are associated with social and economic development. The intricacies of this relationship have attracted much research, an attraction due in part to its relevance for demographic transition theory. Implicit in the literature is the assertion that changes in family structure and fertility declines are ultimate outcomes of socioeconomic development. However, as Friedlander and his colleagues (1979, p. 239), as well as others, have pointed out, "While this proposition is indisputable in the long run, critical questions remain relating to the short-run impact of socioeconomic development on the onset and pace of fertility decline, and to the identification of the specific mechanisms that link socioeconomic development to fertility changes."

Surprisingly, cross-national studies have reported contradictory results. In their review of the literature, Bollen and Entwisle (1981) point out that a significant negative relationship between social and economic development and fertility is in fact not consistently supported in cross-national research. Some studies report positive associations for the fertility/development relationship (Weintraub, 1962; Adelman, 1963; Heer, 1966; Gregory and Campbell, 1976); other studies report negative results (UN, 1965; Kirk, 1971; Beaver, 1975; Hohm, 1975): and some studies show mixed and indeterminant results (Friedlander and Silver, 1967;Janowitz, 1971; Ekahem, 1972). Most surprising, of the multivariate studies in the Bollen and Entwisle (1981) review only Friedlander and Silver (1967), Gregory and Campbell (1976), and Adelman

(1963) report statistically significant results. As Bollen and Entwisle (1981, p. 5) conclude, research to date is inconsistent with "expectations based on theory, historical research and policy assertions."
Cutright and Kelly (1978) suggest that previous research has been plagued by such difficulties as small and illdefined samples, limited theoretical perspectives, and multicollinearity among the modernization variables. Moreover, most cross-national research on the modernization/fertility relationship employ simplistic measures of fertility due to poor data accessibility in most countries, particularly the less developed. The most widely used measure is the Crude Birth Rate (for a few examples see: Kirk, 1971; Kasarda, 1971; Ekamen, 1972; Gregory et al., 1972; Oechsli and Kirk, 1975; Beaver, 1975; Freedman and Berelson, 1976; and Cutright and Kelly, 1978). Less frequently used are age-specific fertility rates (Adelman, 1963), the child-woman ratio (Heer and Turner, 1965;Kasarda, 1971), the Gross Reproduction Rate (UN, 1965; Janowitz, 1971), the General Fertility Rate (Heer, 1966;World Bank, 1974; Srikantan, 1977), and the Total Fertility Rate (Hohm, 1975). No study, to our knowledge, has attempted to relate modernization to a particular fertility outcome, with the exception of recent studies concerning the relationship between modernization and childlessness (Romaniuk, 1980; Poston and Trent, in press; Poston et al., in press).
In an attempt to address some of these issues, this paper explores the relationship between socioeconomic development and parity distribution in the states of Mexico in 1970. Since the mid1940's and continuing through most of the 1970's, Mexico has been experienc-

ing social and economic development (Reynolds, 1970; Solis, 1970; Forsyth and Ramirez, 1981). Despite this growth, substantial intra-national differences remain. Thus, Mexico provides a more than adequate setting in which to explore the variability in modernization and its relationship to parity distribution.
THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES
THE TRADITIONAL PERSPECTIVE
According to an orthodox interpretation of demographic transition theory, socioeconomic development is positively related to the occurrence of lower parities in a population. Many argue that social and economic development have induced fertility declines leading to the completion of the demographic transition in nineteenth-century European society (Davis, 1945, 1949, 1955; Notestein, 1953). A brief and simple synopsis of the theory based largely on the European experience is that mortality rates begin to decline with the onset of modernization, and high fertility rates eventually follow suit. The declines in mortality occur with social and technological improvement such as improved health care and medical technology, higher standards of nutrition, increased production and dissemination of food, and improved channels of communication and transportation. Modernization weakens traditional kinship ties, alters traditional sex roles, early age at marriage, and family size. In addition to increased contraceptive use, all these factors influence fertility decline during the demographic transition. Although there has been considerable debate as to the adequacy and universality of demographic transition theory

women over 45 years of age had never conceived a child; in 1960 among Moslems of northern Cameroon 35 per cent of women aged 25-45 years were childless; in 1952 a sample of Buganda women in Uganda revealed 31.6 per cent of women 45 years of age and over were childless, and among women 25 years and over of the Bobo of Upper Volta a childless rate near 25 per cent has been reported.
More recently, Frank (1983) warned of the potential impact of subfecundity on population growth in Sub-Saharan Africa. She indicated that as much as a 15 per cent increase in total fertility could result if levels of subfecundity are diminished. The per cent of women childless at the end of childbearing is estimated to be as high as 17.3 per cent in the Central African Republic, 20.5 per cent in the Congo and Zaire, and 32.0 per cent in Gabon (Frank, 1983).
While most reports of the extent of subfecundity in developing regions have focused on Africa, Poston and Trent (1983) investigated the phenomenon cross-nationally. They reported circa1970census-based rates as high as 20 per cent in Bangladesh, 18 per cent in Mozambique and Nepal, and 17 per cent in Bermuda, Indonesia, and Peru among women aged 15-49. More specifically, among women who had completed their childbearing (ages 45-49), childlessness rates as high as 26 per cent for Martinique, and 16 per cent for Mozambique were reported. In later analyses of World Fertility Survey data, Poston and his colleagues (1983) found definite evidence that among a sample of fourteen developing nations, little, if any, of the reported childlessness was voluntary. In fact, it was demonstrated that over 90 per cent of the permanent child-

lessness reported in Mexico was involuntary.
The extent of childlessness in developing nations has been well documented, and some studies have attempted to account for the causes and/or possible impact of the phenomenon on population growth. Poston and Trent (in press) investigated the relationship between childlessness and socioeconomic development in 36 developing countries for the circa-1970 time period. Modernization was conceptualized in terms of structural development, health conditions, and female status. The relationships between these three socioeconomic indicators and the rate of marital childlessness were negative. The health conditions component showed the strongest influence, confirming the authors' theoretical argument that involuntary childlessness predominates in less developed countries (see also Poston et al., 1983). Not surprisingly, we may conclude that subfecundity appears to be negatively associated with modernization.
A most persuasive explanation put forth for understanding fertility trends in individual developing countries emphasized the role of subfecundity. Romaniuk (1980) examined the early stages of modernization and its impact on natural fertility from the mid-1950's to the mid-1970's in the country of Zaire and its regions. During this twenty-year period, characterized by improvements in the provision of health services and reduction in malnutrition, "populations in which formerly infertility was high experienced a dramatic reduction in childlessness" (Romaniuk, 1980, p. 304). More recently, Tabutin (1982) reported that, over the course of twenty years, areas of Western Zaire have experienced

substantial fertility increases in the midst of increasing social and economic development. The author attributed one of the major causes of this phenomenon to decreasing levels of endemic sterility.
Most relevant to the study at hand is a subnational investigation of childlessness in Mexico. Poston and his colleagues (in press) found that among the 32 states of Mexico in 1970, levels of modernization were negatively related to childlessness. Four factors of modernization were identified: one clearly reflecting health conditions and the other three indicators of various structural economic dimensions. The health conditions dimension of modernization proved the more influential predictor of childlessness.
If modernization (particularly health components of modernization) has been shown to be negatively associated with childlessness, then it becomes reasonable to expect a similar relationship to occur among other low parities in developing areas of the world. This argument is founded not only on the implications of the above mentioned studies, but also on evidence of repeated problem pregnancies reported in many studies. We turn now to a discussion of subfecundity and low parity outcomes.
Repeated pregnancy loss has been linked to chronic maternal disease, inadequate nutrition and hygiene, low levels of education and income, and other indicators of depressed socioeconomic conditions (Schneider, 1973). Subfecundity as a whole is due primarily to genetic factors, psychopathology, disease, nutritional deficiencies, and environmental factors (McFalls, 1979). The principal causes of subfecundity in the developing world today are disease and nutritional deficiencies which are "com-

pounded by the relative absence of quality health care and facilities" (McFalls, 1979, p. 7).
Many studies have indicated that women who have experienced such difficulties as infertility, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, and fetal death, are likely repeatedly to exhibit problem pregnancies. Also, women with a history of infertility tend to have negative outcomes if they do conceive (see Schneider, 1973; NCHS, 1965; Niswander and Gordon, 1972; and Shapiro et al., 1962, 1965, for more thorough discussions on repeated pregnancy loss). The pattern of repeated pregnancy loss suggests that the achievement of high parity women in a given population serves as testimony to the fecundity of those women.
Thus, an alternative framework for explaining differentials in the relationship between parity and modernization in developing areas emerges. If modernization has been shown to be negatively related to childlessness in developing countries, then, as we have argued, it becomes reasonable to expect a similar relationship to occur among other low parities. However, at the other end of the continuum, modernization and parity may indeed be negatively related as classical modernization theory would predict; the higher the parity, the less likely the presence and influence of subfecundity. Figure 2 demonstrates our argument. The relationship between socioeconomic development and fertility may indeed be a parity-specific relationship. If such is the case, measures of fertility which mask parity specific issues (such as the Crude Birth Rate and the General Fertility Rate) could result in contradictory relationships between fertility and modernization.
The objective of this paper is to ac-

four dimensions of modernization. In

In order to reduce the large number of modernization indicators to reasonable proportions, we chose to factor analyze the twenty independent variables and regress the measures of fertility on the emerging factors. Four distinct factors emerged in the analysis. Factor 1, which we will refer to a Structural Development consists of the per cent literate, per cent of the population in places of 2,5000 + , 10,000 + , and 100,000 + , and the per cent of the population in professional occupations, per cent in agricultural activities, per cent females economically active, per cent dwellings without sewerage, per cent dwellings with piped water, per capita gasoline consumption, and per capita sugar consumption. All eleven of these variables loaded above 0.56; six, above 0.80. The second factor generally reflected Health

this representation we may now more clearly observe the relationships inferred from Table 1. Immediately apparent is that only Factor 1 and Factor 3 show significant bivariate relationships with the dependent variables. As expected, Factor 1which represents structural development, i.e.,' literacy, urbanization, economic activity, sanitation, gasoline, and sugar consumption!, is negatively related to every parity represented. Among the low parities, the higher the levels of modernization, the lower the levels of 1-, 2-, and 3-child families. Contrary to what we refer to as a classical interpretation of demographic transition theory, increases in levels of structural development are not indicated here to be associated with increases in small family size. Factor 3 is positively related to Parities 1,2,3, and

Effects of Subfecundity

Factor 1 (Structural Development) and Factor 3 (Medical Care, Economic Activity, and Transportation) are significant and negative predictors of fertility. Fertility and these dimensions of modernization are negatively related as modernization theory would predict. Over half of the variance in fertility is explained by a model based on socioeconomic development. However, when overall fertility is broken down by parity, we see that this model serves well for middle-range parities, but is less robust for parities on either the lower or higher end of the continuum. Moreover, the predictive power of the various dimensions of modernization are dependent upon the parity under consideration.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
This paper has been concerned with accounting for some of the inconsistencies reported in cross-national research concerning the relationship between socioeconomic development and fertility. We chose to analyze the relationship not only utilizing a measure of fertility similar to those used in past research (average number of children born), but also to investigate the relationship on a parity-specific basis.
Results from bivariate and multivariate analyses of the 32 states of Mexico in 1970 revealed parity differentials in the relationship between modernization and fertility. In general, significant inverse relationships were obtained between modernization indicators and Parities 5 and above. However, at the lower parities, both negative and positive and mostly insignificant results were obtained, indirectly confirming the inadequacy of a classical demographic

transition interpretation at those levels. We suggested that mixed and indeterminant results at the lower end of the parity continuum are due to the combined and opposite effects of modernization on fertility outcomes of low parity women. On the one hand, modernization induces incentives for smaller families. On the other, social and economic development curtails the effects of subfecundity in a population. Thus, the relationship between the average number of children born variable and modernization appears to be weakened by the mixed and indeterminant behavior in lower parities in response to modernization.
Regression analyses revealed that a model based strictly on socioeconomic development is indeed more robust at higher parities, particularly middlerange parities. More importantly, regression analyses showed that the predictive power of the various dimensions of modernization are dependent upon parity. Factor 3 (Medical Care, Economic Activity, and Railroads) was the sole predictor of Parities 1,2, and 3. Interestingly, Factor 1 (Structural Development), which constitutes variables typically used in research on the modernization/fertility relationship, does not become a significant predictor until Parity 4.
In general, we have found considerable support for our argument emphasizing the role of subfecundity among low parity women. To the extent that the inferences drawn in this paper are true, the effects of subfecundity on fertility deserve the attention of policy planners in Mexico. As discussed earlier in this paper, Frank (1983) has warned of the potential impact of subfecundity on population growth. Let us reemphasize
