ABSTRACT: This paper investigates the effects of maternal demographic characteristics and social and economic statuses on infant mortality in rural Colombia. Demographic characteristics include the age of the mother, parity and length of preceding interbirth interval, and sex of infant. Measures of women's status at the time of birth include education, wage labor and occupation, economic stratum, place of residence, and whether the mother is living with a husband. The life history data for the study (involving 4,928 births) were collected in 1986 from a representative sample of two cohorts of women resident in rural central Colombia. Overall diflFerentials in infant mortality by measures of women's status are small and are in good part associated with the differing reproductive behaviors of the women and variations in breastfeeding practices. The sharp declines in infant mortality recorded in rural Colombia in recent years appear less related to improved status of women than to reductions in fertility that enhance infant survivorship and to public health interventions shared by all segments of the population.

A key element in the demographic transition of any modernizing society is the reduction in infant mortality. Lowered infant death is a highly visible outcome of the improved life chances associated with social and economic development, and improved health care delivery (Preston, 1980; Shin, 1975). Significant reductions in infant death permit parents to invest more emotional andfinancialresources in their newborn children and enable parents to think about planning their family size with greater certainty (Preston, 1978; Taylor -et al., 1976). Reductions in fertility often are associated, in turn, with longer birth intervals and fewer high parity births, changes which further reduce infant mortality (Chen, 1983).
During this demographic transition, societies often witness a revolution in

the social and economic lives of women. In Colombia, the society we examine in this paper, these changes in demographic behaviors and the lives of women have had major consequences on the lives of the rural population as well as on urban residents (Florez et al., 1987). Economic divisions in the rural society are important, with the poorest families living in isolated regions without basic public services. While a majority of women are living with a husband when their children are born, a substantial proportion are single mothers who lack access to the economic and social support a husband can provide. The education of these rural women has increased in recent cohorts, although few go beyond primary school. While most mothers do not engage in paid labor at the time they give birth, a substantial

minority do continue such work, often under poor conditions and for low wages.
Research demonstrates that the risks of infant mortality are determined largely by birth weight, nutrition, incidence of infection and accidents, and the quality of health care. Birth weight depends mainly on the length of birth intervals and the mother's nutritional status. The infant's nutrition depends mainly on the intensity and duration of breastfeeding, and on supplements or replacements used in place of breastmilk. The incidence of infections and accidents depends on infant hygiene and quality of care. Health care is determined by the availability and utilization of preventive and curative medical services (Chen, 1983).
The revolution in women's lives has implications for infant survivorship, because of the effects of women's social and economic characteristics on these determinants of infant well-being (Mason, 1984). Factors such as the education of women and the opportunity costs of childbearing promote contraceptive use which lengthens birth intervals (Cochrane, 1983; Wolfers and Scrimshaw, 1975). It has also been hypothesized that more educated mothers are less influenced by traditional practices inimical to modern health care and are more capable of dealing with modern institutions, especially health services (Schultz, 1980). Access to and use of prenatal and postnatal medical care isof critical importance (Smucker et al., 1980; Haines and Avery, 1978; Orubuloye and Caldwell, 1975;Puffer and Serrano, 1973). Furthermore, it has been argued that more educated mothers are able to alter the traditional balance of family relations to favor the allocation

of a greater share of resources to their children (Caldwell, 1979). Thus, enhanced women's autonomy is hypothesized to reduce infant mortality (Mason, 1984; Dyson and Moore, 1983).
Women's employment has contradictory influences on infant mortality. Women's work may be associated with enhanced individual autonomy and improved family incomes, both of which are thought to be beneficial for infant survival. On the other hand, women's work in developing nations often involves long hours and poor working conditions which lessen the ability of mothers to care for their children. Restrictions on their ability to breastfeed may be critical in this regard (Hogan and Kertzer, 1986; Hobcraft et al., 1984).
These measures of the social and economic situations of women are indicative of the status of women, with effects, in turn, on the survival chances of their children. In this paper we investigate the magnitude of these effects on infant mortality in rural Colombia. We first turn to a description of the population and place this study of individual behaviors in the larger context of the demographic transition in Colombia. After describing our data and methods, we present overall differentials in infant mortality. We then attempt to assess the extent to which the dimensions of women's status influence infant survivorship taking into account their impacts on reproductive behaviors, and on breastfeeding.
INFANT MORTALITY DIFFERENTIALS IN
RURAL COLOMBIA
During the last five decades both urban and rural Colombia have been experiencing the demographic,transition process. The process started at the end

of the 1930's with improvements in mortality conditions. Later, by the beginning of the 1960's, fertility began to decline. The crude death rate fell from 30.5 in 1938 to 9.0 in 1978. Life expectancy rose from 44 years in 1938 to 61 years in 1978 and to 67 years in 1985. The crude birth rate decreased from 45.2 at the end of the 1950's to 28.9 in 1980. At the same time, the total fertility rate decreased from 7.0 in 1960-64 to 4.6 in 1972-73 and to 3.6 in 1978, a reduction of almost 50 per cent in less than 20 years. Associated with this demographic process have been government policies in health and education, the activities of the private sector oriented toward providing family planning services, and structural changes related to modernization (Florez et al., 1987;Banguero, 1983).
As part of this demographic transition, Colombia has experienced considerable declines in infant mortality in both urban and rural areas. Infant mortality rates nationally decreased from 200 in 1938 to 61 in 1978 and to 43 in 1985 (Ordonez, 1988). Improvements in the educational levels of the population, the extensive countrywide health campaigns oriented to the prevention of illness during the 1950's and the 1960's, and the national children's immunization campaigns supported by the government during the 1970's and the 1980's are among the factors generally believed to have produced the infant mortality decline.
Despite these dramatic declines in infant mortality, substantial regional, demographic, and socioeconomic differentials in infant mortality levels exist in Colombia. Direct estimates from the 1976 Colombian World Fertility Survey (WFS) indicate that infant mortality is very high when the mother is quite

young, reaches its lowest level for mothers around the ages of 25 to 30, and then increases steadily with age of mother (Somoza, 1980). At the same time, Somoza found that first births have experienced a lower mortality than births of any other order. Given that younger women tend to have births of first order, he explained this apparent contradiction by the fact that a large majority of first births occur at ages 20-29 where there is a clear mortality differential by birth order, with first births experiencing lower mortality. Somoza's (1980) results also indicate that urban infant mortality is lower than rural mortality, and that the highest infant mortality is found in the Pacific region and the lowest in the Oriental-Bogota region. (In all studies based on the WFS data, socioeconomic and residential characteristics refer to the time of the survey and not to the time when the child was born. Colombia is divided into five geographical regions: Pacific, Atlantic, Central, Oriental, and Bogota. However, with the WFS data, it was not possible to study Bogota separately because of small sample sizes.) At the same time Somoza (1980) shows that the mortality of children of women with lower education (less than three yearsof schooling) is higher than the mortalityof the children of mothers with higher schooling (three or more years of schooling).
A multivariate analysis done with World Fertility Survey (WFS) data for 28 countries suggest that there are important variations in the effects of maternal education, work status, and place of residence on infant mortality (Hobcraft, 1984). In order to have comparable results between countries, the research used a standard grouping of education by years of schooling into those with 0,1-3, 4-6 and 7 + years of

Vol. 37, No. 3-4

education. In the case of mother's work status, information from WFS surveys is only available for work status since marriage, with no detail on timing of such work. Hobcraft distinguished three categories, namely, those who have not worked, those who have worked for their immediate family, and those who have worked for others. In the specific case of Colombia, the higher the mother's level of education the higher the children's chances of survival. The work status of the mother and place of residence had no effect on infant mortality. However, since the mother's socioeconomic characteristics refer to the date of the survey rather than to the time of the birth, the results, in particular those for work status and place of residence, may be subject to error. Indirect calculations using data from the 1985 Colombian population census indicate that there still is a significant urban/rural differential in infant mortality (Ordonez, 1988). The infant mortality rate for the country as a whole was estimated as 42, with a rate of 38 in urban areas and 53 in rural areas.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
SURVEY DESIGN
This analysis utilizes data from the Colombian Longitudinal Rural Survey conducted between October and November 1986 by the Center of Studies in Economic Development of Los Andes University, Bogota, Colombia. The main purpose of that survey was to gather life history data on demographic and socioeconomic variables for two cohorts of women representing the behavior before and after the sharp decline in fertility experienced by the country during the last three decades. Women born

in 1937-46 were selected to represent women who were in their reproductive ages at the beginning of the 1960's when fertility began to decline, and women born in 1955-61 were selected to represent those women who were in their reproductive ages in the 1980's after'the sharp decline in fertility. Thus, these two cohorts were 40-49 and 25-31 years of age, respectively, in 1986 when the fieldwork was done.
The area of study was defined as the rural zones of Cundinamarca and Boyaca states located in the higher areas of the Andina region (see Figure 1). This region has similar geographical and cultural patterns to Bogota, the capital and biggest city of the country. It is located between the medium and the higher thermic floors and 1500 meters above sea level. These two states account for almost 80 per cent of the total migrants to Bogota. These rural areas have, in general, good accessibility to urban areas. The average distance for these rural areas to the nearest county seat with a commercial center and health center is close to 7 kilometers. Typically, the journey must be done walking. According to the 1985 census, only 30 per cent of all rural areas in Colombia have a safe supply of water, and 41 per cent have electrical services. The areas under study have relatively better access to these facilities, but even so only about half of them have water and electrical services. These rural areas also have slightly higher educational levels than the average for rural Colombia. The illiteracy rate for the study area is 22 per cent, whereas for the rural areas of the whole country, according to the 1985 census, illiteracy is 30 per cent. The delimited rural area has relatively homogeneous characteristics of economic production and land tenancy relations:

design was probabilistic with equal probabilities for all the elements of the population (that is, it is self-weighting). The sample was a two-stage one. In the firststage, townships were selected, and in the second one, sample dwelling units were selected. The target sample size of 600 women in each cohort led to visits to 3,537 households in 360 conglomerates, of which 3,284 were occupied, and in 3,059 was it possible to get information (93.1 per cent coverage). These households included 570 women from the 1955-61 cohort and 638 from the 193746 cohort. Of these sample women, 93.5 per cent in the 1955-61 cohort and 90.6 per cent in the 1937-46 cohort agreed to be interviewed, giving a total of 533 and 578 completed interviews respectively.
The survey made use of three instruments to obtain data, one for the rural conglomerate, the household, and the woman's life history. The community questionnaire gathered information about isolation, altitude above sea level, and existence of community services. The household questionnaire gathered information on household typology, household quality, and household characteristics as a consumption unit.
Three socioeconomic strata were defined according to relative conditions of the household (quality), tenancy relations, economic support source, isolation, community services access, and community organization. The low stratum included one-third of the households which had the lowest infrastructure and the most precarious production conditions. The middle stratum included the next third of the households, and the upper stratum included the top one-third of the households classified on these aspects of well-being. Women were assigned membership in the socioeconomic strata according to the household to which they belonged.

The woman's questionnaire gathered two sets of information, one on the woman's characteristics at the moment of the interview and another on her life history. The life history tells about the sequence of events in a woman's life on the following variables: residence, education, paid work, non-paid work (housework consumption and/or nonagricultural family type activities), cohabitation, fertility, and family planning. This part was structured as a matrix in which rows corresponded to the woman's age or the dates (calendar years) and the columns, grouped by headings or subjects, corresponded to the measured variables. For each variable, each entry, suspension, or drop-out was registered at the corresponding age with complementary information about characteristics of the events. This life history matrix design allowed checks for internal consistency of the data and facilitated accuracy in the recall of the ages of occurrence of the different events. Specifically, the life history matrix was filled by variables (columns), and as each history variable wasfilledin, it was checked against other life domains for which information had already been provided.
The woman's life history matrix was the main source for the infant mortality data used in this analysis. The retrospective data on fertility included a complete life history for each one of the woman's children born alive, comprising information on the mother's age at birth, and the child's sex, breastfeeding, survival status, and, where relevant, age at death. Additionally, the fertility history also gathered information on other pregnancies that did not result in a live birth, including the woman's age at occurrence and outcome (abortion or dead birth). This information permits flexibility in the analysis. Preceding

birth interval, parity, and date at birth can be calculated for each single live birth. Moreover, the availability of a complete fertility history along with complete residence, education, paidwork, and cohabitation life histories allow us to reconstruct for each woman her social and economic status and other demographic characteristics at the moment of each live birth. This permits us to characterize accurately differentials in infant mortality in a manner not possible with conventional survey data (such as the WFS). These variable retrievals were done using CASA, a Data Base Management System Program written by Nancy Karweit from The Johns Hopkins University. The units of analysis for this study then are the 4,928 live single births recorded in the fertility histories of the two cohort of women.
BREASTFEEDING AS A PROXIMATE
DETERMINANT OF INFANT DEATH
Numerous studies have indicated that breastfed infants experience a lower mortality risk than do artificially fed infants. (For a general review of the evidence relating breastfeeding and infant mortality, see McCann et al., 1981). The advantages of breastfeeding stem from the fact that it is nutritionally ideal assuring that virtually all the infant's nutritional requirements will be met, and that, at least for the initial period of infancy, it provides some immunity against gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases. There is also evidence that breastfeeding does, in fact, affect levels of infant mortality in developing countries (Palloni and Tienda, 1986; Goldberg et al., 1984). Breastfeeding has been found to be an important factor in infant survival, even after other characteristics, such as mother's age at birth, birth order, education of the mother,

and place of residence, have been controlled. Indeed, differentials in breastfeeding often account for many commonly observed differentials in infant mortality.
Estimates of the breastfeeding and infant mortality relationship can be biased by methodological problems. First, since infant's death curtails the duration of breastfeeding, the average duration of breastfeeding among those who survive beyond the first year of age islonger than among those who die before their first year. The resulting truncation of breastfeeding artificially inflates the association between survival status and breastfeeding duration when in fact it is death that leads to shorter durations rather than the other way around. To avoid this bias, one can, if the data allow it, truncate the length of total breastfeeding by considering only the duration to the beginning of the period at risk (Davanzo et al., 1983). Alternatively, when the data on length of breastfeeding is least complete, one can disregard length of breastfeeding and consider only whether or not the infant was breastfed at all up to the end of the period at risk (as we do in this study).
Checks on internal consistency at the time of the interview enhance the reliability of the data. Validation of data quality is provided by a comparison of the estimated infant mortality rate of these births and period estimates of infant mortality. The 1985 Population Census measured the infant mortality rate for the total rural area in Colombia as approximately 52. The estimated infant mortality rate from the longitudinal rural survey is 42 for the two cohorts combined (Table 1). Although this figure islower than the census estimates, we expected it to be so since the infant mortality rate in the survey is calculated

using retrospective data from only two cohort of women living in the rural areas of Cundinamarca and Boyaca states which, as it was shown before, have better socioeconomic conditions than the average of rural Colombia.
The sex ratio at birth is 104.5 and 109.1 for babies born to mothers in the 1937-46 and 1955-61 cohorts, respectively, with an overall normal ratio of 105.8. This provides some evidence that infants of both sexes were accurately recorded. As described below, the survey also shows the usual sorts of differentials in infant mortality by sex of child and age of mother and reproduces the expected trends. We conclude that the data collected in the rural longitudinal survey appear to be of sufficient quality to conduct a study of infant mortality differentials in rural Colombia.
RESEARCH METHODS
Each live birth included in this analysis was classified as an infant death (died during the first year) or a surviving infant (lived at least one year after birth). The independent variables measure demographic and woman's status factors. Those factors are: date of birth (before 1960; 1960-72; after 1972); parity of birth and interval since last birth (first birth; 2-4 parity/1-2 years interval; 2-4 parity/3 years or longer interval; 5 or higher parity/1-2 years interval; 5 or higher parity/3 years or longer interval); sex of birth (male; female); breastfeeding (none; some); mother's age at birth (19 or less; 20-32 years; 33 or more years); cohabitation at birth (yes; no); residence at birth (urban; rural); mother's education at birth (none; primary; secondary or higher); mother's paid work at birth (none; agriculture; industry and services; housework, including independent domestic service); and

mother's cohort (1937-46; 1955-61). Overall infant mortality differentials were calculated through the crossclassification of birth outcome by these independent variables.
Given that our main interest is in the relative effects of woman's status and demographic characteristics on infant death rather than estimates of levels of infant mortality by subgroups or categories, we use logit models. These models are suitable for a multivariate analysis of infant mortality since they consider the relation between a binary dependent variable and a set of independent variables. The dependent variable takes on but two values, say 0 and 1, assumed to be mutually exclusive and exhaustive. The logit model then predicts infant death by:
eBX
l + eBX
where E(\q0) is the predicted (expected) proportion of infant deaths, Jfis a vector of independent variables and B is a vector of estimated parameters. The independent variables can be categorical or continuous. We defined all variables included in the analysis as categorical. The design variables for each categorical variable are considered as a set and their coefficients are expressed to a baseline omitted category. When hierarchical models are built, using stepwise selection procedures, one set of design variables is added or removed from the model according to its statistical significance. Parameters are then estimated by a maximum likelihood procedure. (We use in this analysis the PLR subroutine of the BMDP computer program.)
Statistical tests of significance for the coefficient estimates follow the usual procedures of linear regression. The t-

statistic is used for testing the null hypothesis that a coefficient, say bk,is zero (or equivalently that the variable Xk has no effect on xq0). The likelihood ratio statistic is used to test the joint hypothesis that all coefficients except the intercept are zero, that is for a test of goodness of fit of the overall model (Aldrich and Nelson, 1984; Knoke and Burke, 1980).
RESULTS
DIFFERENTIALS IN THE INFANT
MORTALITY RATE
A total of 207 of the 4,928 children born to the women in this survey died before reaching their first birthday, producing a probability of infant death of 0.042 (see Table 1). The recorded probability of infant death varies by demographic characteristics and women's status variables. The sorts of demographic differentials ordinarily observed in infant death are recorded in this survey. Males have rates of infant mortality that are about one-third higher than females (0.048 vs. 0.036). Substantial declines in infant mortality are observed across periods with 0.072 of babies born prior to 1960 dying, compared to 0.050 of babies born in 1960-72 and 0.033 of babies born after 1972. Babies born to teenage mothers had a substantially higher probability of infant death. First-born children and higher parity births occurring after birth intervals of less than two years displayed considerably higher probabilities of infant death. There were no noteworthy differences in the infant mortality experiences of children born to mothers who were living with husbands and those who were single mothers.
The small number of babies born to these rural-survey women in urban ar-

eas had a slightly lower probability of infant death than those born in rural communities (0.034 vs. 0.043). There were few differences in the infant mortality experiences of children born to rural women in the different economic strata, although children born to women engaged in paid agricultural labor or paid housework had substantially higher probabilities of dying before reaching age one. Children born to mothers who had at least a secondary school education had a much lower probability of infant death than other children, but there was little differential in the infant mortality probabilities of children whose mothers had no education and those whose mothers had primary schooling.
LOGIT MODELS OF INFANT MORTALITY
The earlier ages at first birth, larger family sizes, and shorter birth intervals of women in the lower economic stratum and of those with little education would tend to increase infant mortality among the children of these women. What are the net effects of each of these reproductive characteristics on infant mortality? Do women's status variables influence infant mortality, net of the characteristics of their reproductive behaviors? To address these questions, we estimated logit models of infant mortality that simultaneously consider the influences of these demographic and women's status variables (see Table 2). Table 2, Model 1, shows the net effect of each variable on the logit of infant death, and Table 2, Model 2, includes only those variables that have statistically significant effects on the logit of infant mortality.
The probability of an infant death declined between periods even taking into account the changes in the parity and spacing of births and mother's age and

improvements in socioeconomic status. Females had lower probabilities of dying before age one than males. Relative to first births, births occurring two years or less after another birth had significantly higher probabilities of infant death. This was especially true of infants born to high parity mothers after a short interbirth interval. Comparing births with similar interbirth intervals, infants who were second, third, or fourth children had better survival chances than babies born to higher parity women. Even taking into account the greater likelihood that births to teenage mothers are first births, babies born to such women have substantially poorer chances of surviving until age one. However, there are few differences in the survival chances of children born to women ages 20-32 and those who are 33 and older. Thus, demographic characteristics of the mothers had substantial impacts on infant mortality in rural Colombia, and these differentials conform to those observed in other populations.
Net of these demographic variables, no measure of women's status has a significant additional impact on infant mortality (see Table 2, Model 2). When the measures of women's status are included in the logit model (Table 2, Model 1), their coefficients generally confirm this absence of effects with a few notable exceptions.
Net of other demographic characteristics and measures of women's status, we observe only trivial and nonsignificant differentials in infant mortality by socioeconomic stratum. Women who were living in rural areas at the time their children were born experience higher rates of infant death than those whose children were born in urban areas, consistent with the better maternal

and infant health care services available in urban Colombia. The children of mothers with a primary school education had no better chance of surviving their first year than children whose mothers had no schooling. Children born to women with secondary schooling had a lower recorded probability of infant death, but this result was not statistically significant. Other studies have shown considerable importance of mother's education on infant mortality in Colombia. Although in those studies mother's educational level referred to the moment of the survey rather than to the moment of the birth (as in this study), the non-significant effect of mother's education on infant mortality in this study probably is due to the generally low education of these rural women (averaging 3.6 years in the 1955-61 cohort and 1.8 years in the 1937-46 cohort), rather than to an absence of any educational effects on infant mortality.
Children born to mothers who were engaged in paid work in agriculture or the industrial/service sector of the economy had survival chances that appear slightly higher but were not statistically different from those of babies whose mothers were not engaged in wage labor. Babies born to women who worked as domestics had considerably higher probabilities of dying before their first birthday, and these results are statistically significant. Women who are employed as domestics are from the poorest rural families, and these are among the lowest paying jobs, usually done in urban areas while the babies stay at home with their families. It appears that, even controlling for the generally low position of these women in the socioeconomic stratification system and

for their low educations, their situation is associated with higher risks of infant mortality for their children.
Breastfeeding is an extremely important factor in the survivorship of these infants. Babies who were not breastfed have substantially higher probabilities of dying before age one (see Table 3, Model 1). While some of this differential is an artifact of the inability to breastfeed infants who survive only a few hours or are extremely sick from the time of birth, this linkage is so strong that it accords well with other research documenting the effectiveness of breastfeeding for its nutritional benefits and the resistance to disease it imparts. These effects appear especially salient in a rural population that is relatively poor and with inferior access to medical care.
Do differentials in breastfeeding account for any of the effects of demographic characteristics or women's status variables on infant mortality, or does breastfeeding reduce any differentials that would otherwise be apparent? Comparing the coefficients of Table 3, Model 1, and Table 2, Model 1, there are several noteworthy differences. Downward trends in infant mortality would have been even sharper had there not been reductions in breastfeeding of infants in recent years. The higher infant mortality among high parity births occurring after a short interbirth interval is nearly matched by lower parity births with short interbirth intervals, taking into account breastfeeding practices. Rural women have higher rates of breastfeeding than women living in urban areas at the time of birth, and this partially ameliorates the higher infant mortality that would otherwise be experienced by rural-born infants. Similarly, children of women who are engaged in paid housework would have even higher

probabilities of dying but for the more extensive practice of breastfeeding among these very poor women. The other women's status variables have no significant impact on infant mortality, taking into account the breastfeeding practices of the groups.
Finally, we estimated a model that included all of the demographic characteristics and women's status variables, breastfeeding practice, and the birth cohort of the mother (Table 3, Model 2). This model permits us to confirm that the effects we observe are not an artifact of the two-cohort sampling design of the Colombian study. With the exception of the trend in infant mortality across birth years, introducing a control for the cohort structure of the sample does not alter the estimated effects of the variables on infant mortality. The reduction of the trend in infant mortality between births in 1960-72 and after 1972 is more an artifact of collinearity between child's birth year and mother's birth cohort (since nearly all of the births to the younger cohort of mothers occurred after 1972) than it is indicative of any bias associated with the study design.
The inclusion of a variable for mother's birth cohort also permits a crude assessment of whether intercohort changes in childrearing practices (apart from intercohort changes in fertility, maternal education, and breastfeeding) have reduced infant mortality. The evidence on this issue is negative, given the lack of any significant effect of mother's birth cohort on the logit of infant death.

Colombia. This study replicates previous research ondemographic differentials in infant mortality. Overall differentials in infant mortality by measures of women's status are small, but are in the expected direction. However, multivariate models that take into account the differing demographic characteristics of births to these women indicate few persistent differentials in infant mortality. Most of the observed differentials in infant morality by maternal statuses arein good part associated with the differing reproductive behaviors of the women and variations in breastfeeding practices. Despite these generally negative findings, there are persistent disadvantages for the survival of infants whose mothers work as domestics or paid houseworkers. Differentials ininfant mortality by maternal educationare in the expected direction, but are small and notstatistically significant. This lack of any clearcut differential in infant mortality by maternal education is at least partly attributable to the small number of children born to highlyeducated women in this rural population.

The sharp declines ininfant mortality recorded in rural Colombia in recent decades do not appear to be related to major improvements in the status of women. Rather, decreases in fertility have reduced the number of high parity and closely spaced births that are especially at risk of infant death. Also, important public health interventions that have improved infant survivorship have been shared byall segments ofthe population. In these ways, rural Colombia has witnessed major reductions in infant mortality.
