ABSTRACT:Male and female students were asked to select from photographs projected on slides the individual they would most prefer as a mate in a long-term husband-wife relationship. Frequencies of contrasting hair color, facial expression, and profile types were varied on the slides to determine whether a minority-type advantage occurred. It was found that minority-type females were selected more frequently than expected on slides contrasting hair color and facial expressions, and that minority-type males were selected more frequently than expected on slides contrasting facial expression. The increased selection of the minority females was apparently due to constant bias, whereas the increased selection of the minority males was apparently due to both constant bias and frequency-dependent bias.

From the four groups of photographs, three types of slides were made. One type was a series of 18 "A" slides, each of which consisted of two rows of five photographs and which displayed all five base blonds and all five base brunettes. Each "A" slide consisted of a different randomized arrangement of the individuals in the ten positions on the slide. A second type of slide, those belonging to the " B " series, consisted of 60 slides displaying either one base blond with the five base brunettes, or one base brunette with the five base blonds. Six "B" slides were made for each blond displayed with the five base brunettes and for each brunette displayed with the fivebase blonds. Each slide consisted of six photographs arranged in two rows of three. The photographs on each slide were positioned randomly and no two slides were identical. The third type of slide, those belonging to the "C" series, consisted of 60 slides displaying either one base blond with the five base and six supplementary brunettes, or one base brunette with the five base and six supplementary blonds. Six slides of each base blond displayed with the eleven brunettes, and six slides of each base brunette displayed with the eleven blonds were produced. Each "C" slide consisted of twelve photographs arranged in two rows of six. The photographs on each slide were randomly positioned and none of the slides were identical.
The procedure for producing slides of females differing in facial expression was essentially the same as that used to produce the slides featuring hair color differences. Twenty-two photographs were selected on the basis of their fitting into one of four groups. One group consisted of five photographs of very attractive females with obvious smiles (the

base smilers); another consisted of five photographs of very attractive females who were smiling only slightly if at all (the base nonsmilers); another consisted of six photographs of moderately attractive females with obvious smiles (the supplementary smilers); and another consisted of six photographs of moderately attractive females smiling very little if at all (the supplementary nonsmilers).
As with the hair color photographs, three different types of slides were made from these 22 photographs; an "A" series, a " B " series, and a "C" series. There were 18 different slides of the five base smilers and the five base nonsmilers in the "A" series. There were 60 different slides in the "B" series, all of which displayed either one of the base smilers with the five base nonsmilers, or one of the base nonsmilers, with thefive base smilers. There were also 60 different slides in the "C" series, all of which displayed either one of the base smilers with the five base and six supplementary nonsmilers, or one of the base nonsmilers with the five base and six supplementary smilers.
Only ten photographs were used in producing slides featuring profile differences. The photographs were selected for inclusion on the basis of their fitting into one of two groups. One group consisted of five attractive females displaying a right profile (more of the right side of the face could be seen than the left side) and the other group consisted of five attractive females displaying a left profile. These photographs were used to produce two types of slides, an "A" and a " B " series. The "A" slides displayed all five right profile and all five left profile photographs. Again 18 different "A" slides were produced. The " B " series slides displayed either one right

with the restriction that no two hair color slides, no two facial expression slides, and no two profile slides were shown consecutively. Each slide was projected on a screen for twenty seconds. After the twenty-second interval, dim lights were turned on for five to ten seconds to allow the participants to record the position of the individual they selected. After the five to ten second interval a new slide was shown. Students who did not make a selection from each of the eight slides, non-Caucasians, and anyone not 18to 29 years of age were excluded from the study. These exclusions involved slightly less than 8 per cent of the students viewing the slides.
Female participants in the study were treated in the same manner as the males, though they were asked to make their choices from slides showing photographs of males. Before any slides were shown, the participants were provided with a form on which they could record their selections and other requested biographical information. Just prior to showing the slides, the following statement was read to the participants:
In the first phase of this study you will see groups of photographs projected from slides. From each group of photographs you are asked to select the one individual you would most prefer as your mate in a long-term husband-wife relationship. It is important that you select one and only one individual from each group of photographs. Failure to select an individual or the selection of more than one individual from each group will invalidate your entire set of responses. The females in this class should only respond to the slides showing photographs of males, the males in this class should respond only to the photographs of the females. Anyone not wishing to participate should leave his or her entire answer sheet blank. Please do not make any vocal comments relative to any individual shown in the slides. The slides show only Caucasians. This is not

intended to slight any ethnic group, but rather because it is essential to the design of the study.
THE ANALYSES
To determine whether a minority type advantage existed, a selection ratio was determined for each individual shown in the "A" hair color, facial expression, and profile slides. This ratio consisted of the number of times a particular photograph was selected over the number of times this photo or any of the five photographs of individuals with the contrasting feature was selected. The same selection ratio was determined for each individual when displayed on "B" slides with five individuals of the contrasting type and for each individual when displayed on " C " slides with eleven individuals of the contrasting type. Since all five individuals of each of the two contrasting types were shown on "A" slides, the selection ratio determined for these slides was based on a situation in which the frequency of both contrasting types was 5/10 or 50 per cent. On the "B" and "C" slides, selection ratios were based on slides in which one of the contrasted types was rarer than the other type. The frequency of the contrasted type (the minority type) on the "B" slides was one in six and on the "C" slides was one in twelve.
Both observed and expected group selection ratios were compiled. Observed group selection ratios were computed from "B" and "C" slides using the individual selection ratios. Each group selection ratio consisted of the total number of times all the individuals in a group were selected when they were the minority type over the total number of times a minority type or a contrasting type was selected. Expected group selection ratios were compiled from the

featuring the characteristic by the percentage of participants selecting that characteristic on the other types of "A" slides.
To determine whether the minority type advantage might be due in part to preferences influenced by the temporal rarity associated with the photograph display (frequency-dependent preferences), a comparison was made of the number of "A" and "B" selection disparities with the number of "A" and "C" slide selection disparities.
For example, when each of the hair color photographs was the minority type on a "B" slide and was selected as the most preferred mate, the "A" slide selection of the participant was recorded as to whether it was the same individual, another individual having the same hair color, or an individual with the contrasting type of hair color. Likewise, when each of the base hair color individuals was the minority type on a "C" slide and was selected as the most preferred mate, the "A" slide selection of the participant was recorded.
From this data a ratio (an AB disparity ratio) was compiled, which consisted of the total number of times the "A" slide selections of participants selecting the minority type photograph on the "B" slides were of the contrasting hair color type, over the total number of times the selections were of different individuals with the same or the contrasting type of hair color. The same type of ratio (an AC disparity ratio) was made from the selections of participants choosing the rare type photograph on the "C" slides.
The two ratios were then compared using the previously mentioned statistical methods (using the values of the AB ratios as expected values) to determine whether the increased rarity present on

the "C" slides (one in twelve versus one in six) increased the rate of disparity. The same procedures were used to compile and analyze ratios based on the facial expression slides. Data from the male participants was again treated separately from that of the female participants.
RESULTS
The selection ratios (expressed in whole numbers and as a percentage) for each individual shown on the "A" slides are given in Table 2 (male participant series) and Table 3 (female participant series). These selection ratios represent the number of times an individual on a particular slide was selected as the most preferred mate over the number of times that individual or one of the five individuals with the contrasting trait was selected. The selection ratio on the "A" slides is based on selection opportunities from slides allowing the choice of either of two equally frequent types of individuals. The selection ratio of an individual on the "B" and "C" slides is determined only from opportunities when the individual is the minority type. On "B" slides the frequency of the minority type characteristic is one in six and on the "C" slides is one in twelve.
From the selection frequencies (the selection ratios expressed as percentages) shown in Table 2, it appears for some characteristics that when a particular type is infrequent, the individual with that type is more likely to be selected than when the type is common. Furthermore, it appears that when the particular type is least frequent, the selection frequency is the greatest. This effect is perhaps most evident in the data of the facial expression slides. Seven of the females shown as the minority type

Statistical evidence of an intrinsic preference among the males for smiling or nonsmiling individuals is lacking.

The lower half of Table 6 provides data which indicate that females also have intrinsic or constant mate selection bias. The strongest evidence is from the facial expression series.

Table 7 gives the results of the analyses to determine whether the rarity of a particular type at the time of selection (variable or frequency-dependent bias) was, in part, responsible for the observed minority advantage phenomenon. A larger AC disparity ratio as compared to the AB disparity ratio within a series is expected if frequency-dependent bias plays a part in causing a minority type advantage. From the ratios compiled for the male participants, it can be seen that larger AC ratios than AB ratios are found for both the.hair color and facial expression slides.

type mating advantage is thought to be due only to variable or frequencydependent bias, when, in fact, it may be due to intrinsic or constant bias. Many of the studies demonstrating a rare male mating advantage in Drosophila can be explained on the basis of intrinsic or constant bias (O'Donald, 1977; DeBenedictis, 1977), since only the males which were being selected were varied. If in natural populations the degree of intrinsic bias is directly proportional to the frequency of the type being selected, these studies may be demonstrating an effect that is unique only to experimentally manipulated populations. The same criticism can be applied with respect to the findings showing a minority female advantage in this study, as only evidence of intrinsic bias was found. With respect to the minority male advantage, however, the results of the facial expression analyses (see Tables 6 and 7) indicate that in this case the advantage of the rare type is related both to intrinsic bias and to variable or frequency-dependent bias.
The minority type mating advantage phenomenon may be of great importance in both human and nonhuman populations as a means of maintaining genetic polymorphisms. If a minority type mating advantage exists, the rare type in the population would tend to increase in frequency because of the fitness benefits associated with being preferentially selected as a mate. The type would not become fixed, however, since as the type became common, its mating advantage and therefore, any fitness advantage would be lost. In this way, stable polymorphisms of genetic traits could be achieved without heterosis and without accompanying problems of genetic load common to the heterozygote advantage model. The number of

loci which could be maintained in a polymorphic state by a rare type advantage is limited, however, just as it is with overdominance. As Lewontin (1974, p. 259) has said, "A generalized intrapopulation advantage for rare males with respect to almost any genotype could not exist, if for no other reason than that every male is genotypically rare in a population with 10 per cent heterozygosity and 40 per cent polymorphism!"
The minority type advantage may also be an important means of promoting outbreeding. Rare type individuals are less likely to be related to an individual that is not the same type than to an individual that is. Because of frequent encounters between relatives in many populations, rare type individuals are more likely to be perceived as being rare by nonrelatives than by relatives. Consequently, if a minority mating advantage exists, the effect would act to enhance mating between nonrelatives and thereby increase the degree of outbreeding. Also the introduction of the new individuals into a population would tend to introduce new minority types. If a minority mating advantage exists for these types, the participation of these individuals in the mating pool would be enhanced and, consequently, the degree of outbreeding within the population would increase. Farr (1977) has suggested that the rare male mating advantage he observed in guppies was due to habituation of the females to males with common color patterns. A different color pattern exhibited by a male having an entirely different set of genes acted as a stimulus to which the female responded by ultimately copulating. This, Farr suggested, lessens the degree of inbreeding and increases the degree of genetic variability in the females' offspring.
