To provide the model with enough flexibility, both linear and nonlinear functions were employed. The three ethnic groups studied were Japanese, Caucasians, and Filipinos. The results show that Japanese have the highest tendency to commit suicide while the Filipinos have the lowest. However, the suicide rates of the three groups appear to be approaching a common value. While age and sex proved to be highly significant in explaining suicides, the magnitude and the form of their effect differ between one ethnic group and another. The trends of suicide rates for each ethnic group seem to be the least uniform. Suicide rates are decreasing for Japanese males and females and for Caucasian males. They are increasing for Caucasian females and Filipino males, while not changing for Filipino females.

Caucasians were chosen as a reference group because of their influence on every aspect of Hawaii's culture, such as the language, the economy, the arts, etc. Hawaiian Caucasians and mainland U.S. Caucasians may be considered culturally similar since the majority of Hawaiian Caucasians originated from the mainland. For instance, in 1970 only 34 per cent were born in Hawaii and 3.3 per cent were foreign-born, the rest coming from the mainland (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1971). Japanese, especially the elderly, are believed to commit suicide more often than Caucasians, while Filipinos, governed by a strong Roman Catholic influence, are expected to commit suicide less often.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
A simple regression of the suicide rate on ethnicity is not a useful procedure for assessing its effect. Excluding a significant variable that is correlated with ethnicity would cause its coefficient to be biased. For example, if age is excluded and if Japanese live longer than the other two groups, the effect of their ethnicity on suicide would be overestimated. Below is a brief discussion of some of the variables that affect suicide.
VARIABLES
Ethnicity.--In discussing ethnicity and suicide some investigators attempted to isolate the racial effect. This effort is a hazardous task that may not lead to valuable conclusions. Stengel (1973) studied the South African populations and was not able to assess the effect of race on suicide because he could not control other relevant cultural factors. Hence, most comparative suicide studies concentrate on the cultural parameters rather than on the narrower issue of racial differences.
were racially mixed, and this percentage is increasing with time (State of Hawaii, 1973).

The fact that reported suicide rates vary greatly between one country and another is at least suggestive of real ethnic differences. Sainsbury's (1968) findings indicated that differences in suicide rates between nations and between districts within a nation are real and do not confirm the view that these differences can be attributed to reporting methods. Great differences have been reported in various parts of the world (Barrett, 1967). In 1952, the rate was around 18/100,000 in Japan compared to 10.8/100,000 in the United States. In 1963, the rate was still higher in Japan, although the gap had narrowed somewhat (Kramer et al., 1972).
In a classic study, Guernsey (1883) stated that in some Oriental countries suicide was not only legal but was considered meritorious. "Hara-kiri" in Japan was for many centuries an honored traditional form of suicide, particularly among the nobility and military castes. Until the practice was prohibited by law in 1868, convicted criminals in Japan used to disembowel themselves to save family name and property. The history of Japan is full of famous figures who committed suicide. Mass suicide was frequent in the caves of Okinawa during World War II.
Western religions, on the other hand, took a strong stand against suicide. Early Christians thought of suicide as being a product of "diabolical inspiration," believing those who committed suicide died with a mortal sin. Ultimately, canon law decreed in the sixth century that a suicide would not Jbe buried on church territory, i.e., consecrated ground. This attitude, according to Virkkunen (1974) may have stemmed from the belief that God has a sovereign power over life and man cannot therefore interfere in any way.
Porterfield (1965) maintains that religion acts as a sort of prophylactic against suicide. He explains that it is not specific dogma but rather the belief phenomenon
