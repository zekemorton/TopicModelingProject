A rapid increase in outcrossing, or mating between ethnic groups, has been noted in the United States in the past twenty years. There is considerable evidence that there has been a decline in consanguinity rates and a simultaneous increase in the frequency of interethnic marriages. Nonetheless, there have been few studies on the consequences of outcrossing. This report conveys the findings of a research project on the interrelationships among three factors: fetal loss, the number of countries in the background of parents, and the distances between birthplaces of parents.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Data were collected on every pregnant woman entering the clinic of the Providence Lying-in Hospital, Rhode Island, during the calendar years 1960-1961 and on 131 consecutive pregnant private patients who visited an obstetrician during April and May of 1961.
About 40% of the infants born in Rhode Island and 65% of those born in Providence in the early 1960's were delivered in the Providence Lying-in Hospital. A large number of women residing in the state delivered most or all of their infants at this hospital. Hence, it was possible to obtain a nearcomplete, and at times complete, reproduc-

tive history on many women from the hospital medical records.
However, for local administrative reasons, data on abortions and stillbirths prior to a first live delivery in the Providence Lying-in Hospital, were not available. Therefore, only fertile women, generally in their mid-reproductive stages, who had at l.east one prior live birth in the hospital, had usable records for purposes of this investigation. This qualification signifies there is no attempt to produce a "standard" for fetal loss in relation to the number of pregnancies. Naturally the women in this study would be older and have had more pregnancies than those in any nationally based set of averages.
From the Providence Lying-in Hospital records, data were collected on parental ethnic groups, place of birth, illegitimate births, twin births, clinical condition, and other factors which could influence the inclusion or exclusion of the woman and family unit in the sample. Additional and corroborative information on reproductive history of the women was obtained from other hospitals and many gynecologists and obstetricians in Rhode Island.
An in-depth interview was arranged with each woman in the sample to obtain the desired ethnic information. Specifically, each woman was asked to supply information on

race, religion, and national origin for: (a) herself and her husband (two individuals in the Pi generation) ; (b) her parents and her husband's parents (four individuals in the P2 generation) ; and (c) her grandparents and her husband's grandparents (eight individuals in the P3 generation). Since few women could provide this detailed information immediately, each was asked to complete the survey sheet at home. In addition, each woman was asked to provide additional information about herself and her husband (Pi generation), such as birthplace, age, prior pregnancies, adoption, and illegitimacy.
Originally, complete records were sought for 792 clinic patients and 131 private patients. Certain items of information were deemed critical, and their absence was sufficient cause for the elimination of the records of a woman and her family from the present analysis. Whole family histories were eliminated if any one of the 42 pieces of the "ethnic" data was unknown. Additional reasons for exclusion from the main sample were: a known illegitimacy in any prior live birth, an incomprehensible reproductive history, a reproductive history involving two or more husbands, and the presence of twins in any pregnancy. Excluded from this report are the 158 family histories where one or more individuals had an African background because interracial matings are not the focus of the present study.
In summary, all matings accepted for this ethnic study met the following conditions: (a) all 14 individuals in the family history were white; (b) national origin and religion was known for all 14 individuals in the family unit; (c) according to the best available information at the time, the pregnant women had never had an illegitimate child, a previous husband, or twins; (d) specific birthplaces were known for the pregnant women and their husbands; (e) all the pregnant women had at least one prior live-born child. Almost all of the pregnant

women and their husbands lived in an urban-suburban environment in central Rhode Island.
The data on reproductive wastage were originally collected in terms of stillbirths and abortions. At that time hospital officials designated reproductive wastage of under 28 weeks as an abortion, and more than 28 weeks as a stillbirth. However, continued experience in handling the data revealed many inaccuracies in assignments compelling us to abandon the classification and substitute the collective term "fetal loss."
The sample presented in this paper contains 708 family histories. Of these, 593 were from clinic patients and 115 were from private patients. These two subsamples were combined after an analysis of two variables: the average numbers of pregnancies and of live births in each group. For clinic patients, the averages were 3.31 and 2.99 respectively; for private patients, the averages were 2.42 and 2.16 respectively. However, the critical comparison is the percentage of live births compared to total pregnancies. The population of clinic patients was unexpectedly higher--90.2% as contrasted with 89.3% for the private patients. A chi-square test was made on private vs. clinic and live births vs. fetal loss. The chi-square value was 0.11 after a correction was made for continuity, with P > 0.50.
The second consideration was a comparison of the number of countries of birth in the parental generation (P3) of the 708 couples. Up to six different countries were found in the parental backgrounds of the 593 clinic couples. By number of countries and number of couples, the figures were: one, 189; two, 228; three, 137; four, 31 ; five, 7, and six, 1. The numbers for the 115 private patients were: one, 35; two, 45; three, 24; four, 9; five, 2; and six, 0. A t test revealed P > 0.50.
It may also be argued that the relationship of socioeconomic status to fetal loss represents a bar to combining the clinic and

private samples. Table 1 shows theassignment of the families into a tripartite socioeconomic arrangement.1
It is evident from thesample data that socioeconomic status appears to have little effect on fetal loss (chi-square test: live born vs. fetal loss value is 0.134, 2 d.f., P > 0.90). For this and other reasons cited above, itwas judged unnecessary to keep the clinic and private samples separated for analysis.

data for four, five, andsix countries were combined in a test involving live born vs. fetal loss, thechi-square equaled 8.87 with the level of probability between 5% and 2%.
Family records were also separated into two categories: (a) fetal loss never recorded in the Filevel; and (6) at least one fetal loss

As expected, an analysis of the data clearly shows that fetal loss increases with age. However, in all ofthe subsequent analyses presented inthe tables ofthis report this factor did not show significant deviations from the mean in any of the classes or groups ofdata soastorepresent a cause for increased ordecreased fetal loss.

The distance between birthplaces within the continental 48 states of the Pi generation was charted on a straight-line basis. In this analysis only 646 families were used, since 62 were eliminated because one or both of the Pi generation members were foreign born. The greatest distance between two points in Rhode Island is approximately 50 miles, and thus couples born within the state were placed in a separate category. However, many couples then residing in Rhode Island had birthplaces in other states which were also less than 50 miles apart. These too were put in a cognate category below the "Rhode Island X Rhode Island"

difference in the average number of P3 countries between these two populations. For a further chi-square test, data from the last two rows were combined to make one row of 1,000 miles or more. In addition, data in the columns of 4, 5, and 6 countries were combined, making 12 cells of data. The twelfth cell has an expected value below five. Omitting this cell results in a chi-square value of 11.14, somewhat short of the 5% level (6 d.f.); including the cell results in a chi-square value of 16.02, and this is > 1% level.
Data in Table 5 show that with increasing distances there is greater fetal loss. Com-

paring all matings involving less than 50 mile distance with all matings of more than SO mile distance, and also comparing them on a fetal loss vs. live born basis, the chisquare value was 8.21 or > 1% after a correction for continuity was made. Admittedly, the relation between distance and fetal loss alone is superficial, but the relation assumes meaning when viewed from the findings indicated in Table 4. The fundamental relation is between fetal loss and number of countries of birth with distance between birthplaces "representing" this more significant association.
Table 6 contains the combined data of

Table 4 and 5. The relationship between increasing fetal loss and countries of birth is corroborated. However, a difference between the two distance groupings is noted. An immediate interpretation cannot be offered for this "migration factor." A subsequent fuller report containing further analysis involving interfaith and intrafaith religious matings, blood group genes, height of parents, and age of parents is planned.
COMPARATIVE DATA
An earlier report (Bresler, 1961o) contained data on blood group genes and infant hemoglobin. Data on reproductive wastage were collected but never published. Those

Reproductive histories were collected on all white, Rh negative women who entered Providence Lying-in Hospital between the years of 1950 and 1958. No cases were rejected for any clinical disorder. Certain indices of the original data indicated that the population was typical for the geographical area. These were the ABO distribution of mothers, fathers, and infants, and the Rh distributions for fathers. As for the present sample, which we shall designate as Population A, data were collected on women who had at least one prior live birth in the hospital. In the latter part of 1961 we contacted the parents by mail for the ethnic information and received 391 useful histories.
In summary, the following information was available on Population B : (a) all mothers were white and Rh negative; (5) all fathers were white; (c) all members in the P3 and P2 generation were listed as white; (d) birthplace information was available on all parents; (e) a reproductive history was used only when no known or suspected illegitimacy, twins, or two husband situations were indicated; and (/) all women had at least one prior live birth.
In Tables 7 and 8 the number of countries of birth in the P3 generation is related to factors previously analyzed for Population A. Although there are insufficient numbers, it is clear that there are replications of the directions reported in Population A.
In Table 2 fetal loss begins at 7.6% for the one-country category, whereas in Table 7 it begins at 8.6%. Ignoring all country categories where five or fewer families are found, the fetal-loss percentage increases 10.3% in four increments in Table 2 and 8.8% in three increments in Table 7. In Table 2 the approximate average increment is 2.6%, whereas in Table 7 it is 2.9%. Combining these data, the sum of the seven increments is 19.1%, or an approximate 2.7% increase for each country. Hence, it would tentatively appear that each additional

country adds between 2.5% and 3.0% fetal loss. At least this appears to be the case in the lower half of the theoretical range of countries from 1 through 8.
TWINS
Twin data for 16 families in Population A and 6 families in Population B were available. The mothers in Population A had 72 pregnancies with an average of 4.5 each. Five pregnancies failed to result in a live birth, resulting in a 6.9% fetal loss. In Population A, the Pi generation had a 2.44 average number of countries in the P3 generation. For Population B the results were respectively: 19 pregnancies, a 3.17 pregnancy average, 5.3% fetal loss, and 2.5 as the average number of countries. If, for the sake of a broad overview, the results from both populations are combined, the results are: 91 pregnancies, a 4.13 pregnancy average, 6.6% fetal loss, and 2.45 as the average number of countries (Pi).
The first observation to be made in comparing these results to those in Tables 2 and 7 is that the average number of pregnancies is higher. Even more unexpected is the markedly low fetal loss of 6.6% vs. 9.9% (Population A) and 10.7% (Population B). Thus, the fetal loss percentage of the twin population is below the "one-country" category for either Population A or B, and there is a higher average number of countries in the twin population, 2.45 vs. 2.07 (A) and 2.13 (B). For the average number of countries, an approximate 10.6% fetal loss is "expected" rather than the observed 6.6%. No explanation can be offered on this twin data combination of high fertility, low fetal loss, and high average number of countries in the background. It would appear, however, that women giving birth to twins have a favorable reproductive history.
DISCUSSION
I t is concluded that greater fetal loss is indeed related to greater heterogeneity in

the background. This would appear to be the case for two all-white samples in this investigation. No extrapolation of these findings can be made to interracial matings at this time.
The adverse effect of additional countries on fetal loss appears to be cumulative, there

being no threshold, in terms of number of countries, which is associated with a large increase in fetal loss. Additional data involving six or more countries in the background areneeded to seewhether a threshold exists at these levels. The salient question remaining is how to relate this increased fetal loss to genetic and/or social factors.
Previously (Bresler 1961&, 1962) I reported on the relationship of the fertility patterns of a white Rhode Island population of one generation and the ethnic mixtures in

show increased fetal loss with outcrossings. These collective results can best be interpreted from a genetic basis, with sociocultural factors entering into the findings in a minor way. The most suitable explanation is as follows: The greater the number of countries in the background, the greater is the likelihood that larger numbers of Mendelian gene pools arebrought together. With greater mixing of gene pools and concomitant genetic imbalance between loci, fetal loss increases. Fortunately there is an ani-

mal model which supports this view as shown by the summary of the excellent series of experiments conducted by Moore (1943, 1946, 1947, 1949, 1950, 1951, 1952) which follows.
In many ways, the evolutionary status of the North American frog, Rana pipiens, is similar to the human species. The geographic range of the frog is very wide, encompassing virtually all of North America. Rana pipiens is found in many different environments, such as both hot and cold areas, wet and dry areas, and at high and low altitudes. While the taxonomic status is not clear, it seems reasonable to conclude that the species complex contains a very large collection of local geographical races even though it is convenient to regard the whole group as a "single" species. For example, a frequently used taxonomic set of characteristics such as pigmentation shows such a bewildering array of clinal shifts that it is difficult to sort the group into cohesive units (Bresler, 1963,1964).
Accordingly, Rana pipiens, like man, is a vertebrate found in a very extensive geographical range--sometimes isolated, sometimes partially isolated, and sometimes in broad panmictic populations. It is also difficult to classify even with characteristics commonly accepted by investigators.
Moore found that he could bring frogs from different environments of the geographical range into the laboratory, make appropriate genetic crosses, and study reproductive wastage and development. Significant findings include:
1. The hybrids between members of adjacent geographical territories tended to be normal in development and morphology.
2. The greater the geographical distance between parental combinations in eastern North America, the more retarded was the rate of development, the greater were the morphological defects in the hybrids, and the fewer were the normal individuals.
3. The greater the geographical distance between parental combinations, the larger was the percentage of eggs which failed to develop properly.

4. The further apart in geographical distance in eastern North America the members were collected from, the earlier in development did reproductive wastage occur.
Strict comparisons between this study and the previously published excellent study on interracial crosses in Hawaii (Morton, Chung and Mi, 1967) are difficult to make. That study was addressed to first-generation racial hybrids and a complex of indices of heterosis and recombination as well as issues involving quality of live offspring. The present study is an intraracial study of matings involving significantly smaller evolutionary differences between parents and their effect only on one index, fetal loss.
SUMMARY
Data on two white populations show that fetal loss (Fi generation) in matings of the parental generation (Pi) increases cumulatively by approximately 2.5% to 3 % with each additional country of birth in the greatgrandparental generation (P3). A dependent relation shows that increased fetal loss is also related to greater distances between birthplaces of mates within the Pi generation. Conversely, low fetal loss is encountered with a small number of countries in the background and shorter distance between birthplaces.
I t is suggested that a larger number of countries of birth represents a larger number of Mendelian gene pools and that with increased mixture of these gene pools, fetal loss increases proportionately. An animal model is cited in support of this contention.
