ABSTRACT: The purpose of this analysis was to determine if there were differences in selected fertility characteristics including parity, pregnancy spacing, ageat first pregnancy, ageof menarche, breastfeeding postpartum, and contraceptive practices among white, black, Hmong, and other Southeast Asian mothers attending a maternal infant care program in Minneapolis, Minnesota, during 1980-82.
White and black mothers were younger than the Hmong and other Asian mothers. The lowest mean age of first pregnancy was among blacks. Ages of first pregnancy were similar for whites, Hmong, and other Asians, although the mean ageof menarche wasapproximately two years later for Hmong and other Southeast Asian mothers compared to the white and black mothers.
Based on self reports at the first postpartum visit onemonth after delivery, 39per cent of the whites and 25 per cent of the blacks were breastfeeding. In comparison 8.7 per cent of the Hmong and 17per cent of theother southeast Asian mothers were breastfeeding.
Maternal age and age at first pregnancy were significant predictors of parity for whites, blacks, Hmong, and the other Southeast Asians. Ever-use of contraception was a significant predictor of parity only for Hmong.
The highest proportion of ever-users of contraception wasamong the white mothers (80 per cent) followed by the blacks (69.3 per cent) and other Asian mothers (34.8 per cent). Hmong mothers had the lowest proportion having used contraception (17.1 per cent).

methods. Johnson and Stokes (1976) have found that if individuals are satisfied with existing norms and roles, their fertility pattern will mimic that of their family of origin.
There is limited data that systematically represent Southeast Asians in the United States and also provide sufficient information about ethnicity, fertility, and contraceptive use. Consequently, research has had to utilize specific clinic data or rely on more generalizable data with limited variables to measure fertility and contraceptive practices. Most previous research has focused on refugees entering the United States during the mid-1970's who were predominantly urban and more educated than the second wave of refugees entering the United States in the late 1970's. The purpose of this analysis is to assess differences in parity, pregnancy spacing, age at first pregnancy, age of menarche, breastfeeding, and contraceptive practices among white, black, Hmong, and other Southeast Asian mothers attending a maternal infant care program in Minneapolis, Minnesota during 198082.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data base consists of the service statistics from the Minneapolis Health Department Maternal Infant Care Program. Interpreters were available to ask questions and translate responses. Between 1980-82 a total of 594 white, 192 black, 356 Hmong, and 112 other Southeast Asian (Cambodians, Laotians, Vietnamese) mothers delivered in the Maternity and Infant Care Program. While Minnesota has about 3 per cent of the total Southeast Asian refugees that have come to the United States up to 1982 (Office of Refugee Resettlement,

1982), 80 per cent of these refugees have settled in Hennepin and Ramsey counties with the majority residing in Minneapolis and St. Paul. The refugees in this study population entered the United States in 1979.
Southeast Asian women receiving care at the Minneapolis Health Department had less than 5 years of education compared to an average of 11 years for whites and blacks. Income per individual in Southeast Asian families was less than for whites and blacks, although 97 per cent of the Hmong and 88per cent of other Southeast Asian mothers were married compared to 35 per cent of the whites and 25 per cent of the blacks. Southeast Asian mothers were older (25-26 years) and of higher parity (3-4) than whites and blacks. On the average, white and black mothers were 22-23 years old and had one living child.
Five per cent of the Hmong and 10 per cent of the other Southeast Asian mothers spoke some English when admitted to the program. The other Southeast Asians include three distinct ethnic groups, Cambodians, Laotians, and Vietnamese, while the Hmong represent one distinct ethnic group, a nomadic hill tribe that had resided primarily in Laos (Swenson et al., 1985).
RESULTS
Age at first pregnancy was similar for whites, Hmong, and other Asians although the mean age of menarche was approximately two years later for Hmong and other Southeast Asian mothers compared to the white and black mothers (Table 1). The outcome of the first pregnancy comprising the most recent intervals was a nonlive birth for 8.6 per cent of the Asians, compared to 26.5 per cent of the whites and 22.2

per cent of the blacks (Table 2). There is no distinction in outcome of the most recent nonlive birth as being either a spontaneous or an induced abortion. How-

ever, whites and blacks more frequently reported a history of both spontaneous and induced abortions than did Hmong or other Asians. Although Hmong and

other Asians had minimal differences in the reported frequencies of previous spontaneous abortions, 10.7 per cent of the other Asians reported previous induced abortions compared to 1.4 per cent of the Hmong. Although considerably more of the Hmong and other Asians had intervals of less than 12 months compared to the whites and blacks, smaller proportions of the Hmong and particularly the other Asians had completed intervals during

the years since they entered the MIC program compared to the whites and blacks (Table 2).
The regression model for parity, explaining 69 per cent of the variance, indicated that whites and blacks had significantly lower parities than other Southeast Asians, although Hmong had significantly higher parities than other Southeast Asians (Table 3).

per cent of the blacks were breastfeeding. In comparison, 9.2 per cent of the Hmong and 17 per cent of the other southeast Asian mothers were breastfeeding. Clinic data does not specify whether the mothers were fully or partially breastfeeding.
There were differences between mothers who had not previously used contraception and those who had previously used contraception in their acceptance of contraception postpartum, particularly for the Hmong mothers. While 90.9 per cent of the Hmong mothers who had used contraception previously accepted contraception after delivery, 62.9 per cent of the Hmong mothers who had not used contraception previously accepted contraception postpartum. There were differences in the percentages returning for their postpartum visit among ever-users compared to never-users. Hmong who had not previously used contraception were more likely to return for their postpartum visits than those who had previously used

contraception. The converse was true for whites.
Among the previous users, white and Hmong mothers most frequently chose barrier methods: diaphragms, foam/ jelly or cream. Black and other Asian mothers most often chose oral contraceptives. Among never-users, white and black mothers most often chose oral contraceptives, while Hmong and other Southeast Asian mothers most often chose barrier methods.
DISCUSSION
Concurrent with their higher parities and closer pregnancy spacing, the majority of Southeast Asian women had not used contraception in the past. Contrary to expected findings, the Southeast Asian women were less likely to breastfeed than black and Caucasian women. Although breastfeeding may have been more prevalent among the Southeast Asians prior to their entry into the United States, it may be more conven-

to the Hmong. Some clinic staff suggest that the Southeast Asian mothers may both breast- and bottle-feed although they report bottle-feeding, thus producing some underreporting of breastfeeding among the Southeast Asians. The 'short intervals observed among the Southeast Asians, particularly the Hmong, may reflect their lack of breastfeeding coupled with their limited use of modern contraceptives.
The interpregnancy intervals are in most cases closed intervals where the first pregnancy comprising the interval occurred before the mothers' entry into the MIC program. The first pregnancy of the intervals for most of the Asian mothers occurred before the mothers' immigration to the United States. The larger proportions of nonlive births as first pregnancies of intervals for whites and blacks compared to the Asians may distort comparisons of pregnancy spacing between the race groups.
Estimates of spontaneous and induced abortions may be biased by less complete reporting of fetal deaths by the Asians compared to the whites and blacks. Higher reporting of induced abortions among the other Southeast Asians compared to the Hmong may reflect their greater efforts to control fertility. This interpretation is supported by the higher reported frequencies of ever-use of contraception among other Southeast Asians compared to Hmong, more effective use of contraception, preferences for oral contraceptives and IUD's, and the proportion of other southeast Asian mothers selecting tubal ligation. These findings may be related to the fact that the other Southeast Asian mothers were also slightly older and of higher parity on the average than white and black mothers. In addition, the other Southeast Asians had more

education than Hmong and potentially were more inclined to limit childbearing to increase opportunities for upward social mobility.
The increase in use of contraception postpartum compared to prior to entry into the MIC program suggests acceptance when methods are available. Conclusions about contraceptive methods may be biased by several conditions. First, contraceptive use after delivery may be a temporary method which the women may change at a later time. Secondly, the differences in proportions returning for postpartum visits vary between race groups by previous use of contraception.
The older ages of first pregnancy reported by the Hmong and other Southeast Asians may be due to the years of war and disruption. Therefore, age of first childbearing among the Southeast Asian refugees requires further examination in future research particularly when considering the lack of any significantimpact of age of menarche on age of first pregnancy for Hmong and other Asian mothers. Validity of data on age of menarche may be more questionable for the Asian than for the white and black mothers. However, the differences in the mean ages of menarche may reflect the differences in nutritional status between the groups prior to menarche.
