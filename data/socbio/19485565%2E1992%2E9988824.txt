ABSTRACT: The study investigates the relationship between age at marriage and the length of first birth interval in two states of India: Uttar Pradesh and Kerala. Life tables of first-birth intervals and median first-birth intervals are computed for several subgroups of the study population. Multivariate hazards modelling technique is used to study the net effect of age at marriage, controlling for a multiple of socioeconomic factors. The result shows that the average first-birth interval varies by age at marriage and is much longer in Uttar Pradesh than in Kerala.

In populations in which marriage is nearly universal, age at marriage has a strong influence on a variety of demographic and social phenomena. Early and universal marriage are the two most outstanding features of rural society in India. Quite often girls are married at an age well before puberty. Together with economic causes, social considerations are important factors perpetuating the custom of early marriage. In almost all cases, the marriage is arranged by the parents or the guardians, and the prospective bride and bridegroom are generally not consulted in this respect.
Marriage does not signal the beginning of cohabitation or sexual relations. It is only after the Gauna or Rukhsat (hereafter termed return marriage [RM]) ceremony that the bride goes to live with her husband, and the partners enter conjugal relations. The distinction between marriage and RM is a critical element in what is often referred to as a "two-stage" marriage process. The two-stage process always

operates in the case of childhood marriage, but it also operates quite often in marriages that take place after menarche. Generally, RM is performed at an age when a girl is considered physically mature enough to become a wife although exceptions are not uncommon. In certain rural parts of India, a custom of frequent visits by brides during the early years of their marriage is prevalent. After RM, brides usually stay for a short duration with their in-laws and then return to their parents for a considerable period. Further, they make frequent short visits to their parents in the following years. Older women in the family customarily isolate younger women from their husbands during the initial days of marriage.
Marital customs vary by regions in India, and India's Kerala state presents a different marital pattern. The custom of return marriage is nonexistent in Kerala. Age at marriage has been constantly rising in Kerala and is the highest in the nation for men and women. The more years of schooling a woman

has, or the better off she is economically, the more likely she is to marry at an older age. Caste and religion also make a difference. Economic factors, such as the employment of the prospective husband are key determinants of marriage in Kerala (Zachariah, 1984). Kerala has received worldwide attention for its unpredicted fertility decline in recent years. Rapid fertility decline took place despite low percapita income and low levels of industrialization, urbanization, and nutrition. The links between marriage and fertility are at least superficially obvious. Rising mean age at marriage and rising percentages of single individuals are associated with declines in measures of fertility such as the birth rate. Women who marry late in any population ultimately have fewer children on average. It is estimated that nearly 30 per cent of the overall fertility decline in Kerala is because of an increase in age at marriage. In Kerala, consummation of marriage takes place with the marriage, and virtually no couple uses contraception before their first child is born.
In societies where contraception is nonexistent, such as India, timing of the first birth is considered a measure of fecundity. However, the childspacing patterns in India have not been extensively studied. Timing of the first birth is influenced by social factors such as the return marriage customs in Uttar Pradesh and biological factors such as age at menarche (especially because of the early age at marriages) and nutritional levels (such as the low nutritional status of Kerala population) (Panikar, 1980).
We examine the timing of first birth in two Indian populations (Uttar Pra-

desh and Kerala) with emphasis on the role of age at marriage. In Uttar Pradesh, age at return marriage is considered the beginning of sexual activity, whereas in Kerala such activity begins with the marriage ceremony. The availability of data from two time points (1978 and 1987) from Uttar Pradesh allows us to look at trends in the timing of first birth in the population. Since marriage is usually associated with social and economic factors such as religion, education, year of marriage, and work status, this study examines the net effect of age at marriage, controlling for these factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The basic data we use come from three surveys. Two Uttar Pradesh surveys--Rural Development and Population Growth: A Sample Survey, and Effect of Socio-cultural Factors on Determinants of Fertility in Eastern Uttar Pradesh--were conducted in 1978 and 1987 under the auspices of the Centre of Population Studies, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh (UP). The third, the Kerala Fertility Survey, was conducted in 1980 by the Kerala State Bureau of Economics and Statistics and the World Bank.
The objective of the UP surveys was to study the fertility level and other demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. The 1978 and 1987 surveys included all the households--3,514 from one district and 4,230 from three districts, respectively. A couple (or woman) was eligible if both partners were alive on the reference dates (March 25, 1978, and October 1, 1987), and the woman was less than age 50. In addition to other informa-

tion, data relating to age at marriage and RM, the interval between RM and first birth and between consecutive births, and age at different orders of birth were collected for each married female in the household.
The objective of the Kerala survey was to examine the determinants of the recent fertility decline in Kerala. The study used data collected from 3,000 households selected randomly from three districts of Kerala, chosen on the basis of geographical location and fertility level. For every adult living in the household, information was collected on marriage, attitudes toward marriage, fertility history, and on a number of socioeconomic variables.
The variable of principal interest in the study is timing of the first birth. At the time of the survey, many women had not given birth to their first child. For such women, we know only that their duration to first birth exceeds the time elapsed from marriage to the survey date. These observations are known as censored observations. Thus, the data in the present study consists of complete (for those who have given birth) and censored (for those who have not given birth) observations. The principal statistical methods of analysis of such data are life table techniques (Namboodiri and Suchindran, 1987). Life tables of first-birth intervals and median first-birth intervals from the life tables were computed for several subgroups of the study population. For studying the net effect of age at marriage, controlling for a multiple of socioeconomic factors, we use the multivariate hazards modelling technique (Cox, 1972).
The explanatory variables we use are listed in Table 1. To facilitate in-

terpretation, in this study women were grouped according to their age at RM (or simply marriage) as follows: Group I, up to 13; Group II, 14, 15; Group III, 16, 17, 18; Group IV, 19 and above.
The first group represents the prepuberty group, the second and third represent early and late adolescence, and the final group consists of women starting sexual activity postadolescence.
RESULTS
In Table 1 we give the mean age at RM (or marriage in the case of Kerala) for various subgroups in the study population. The overall mean age at RM rose by 0.9 a year from 1978 to 1987 in UP, whereas in Kerala the overall mean age at marriage in 1980 was a full two years higher than the 1987 UP figure. As seen in Table 1, age at marriage varies by timing of marriage, educational status of husband and wife, and religion. In both UP and Kerala, age at marriage is lower when husband and wife have less education and in Kerala among those who married before 1970, nonworking women, and Muslims.
In Table 2 we show the median birth intervals and the proportion who did not have a birth in ten years (the 1978 UP survey allows only a duration up to 98 months) calculated from the life tables of first-birth intervals for several subgroups of the study population. These life tables do not adjust for the difference in age at marriage. Both in UP and Kerala, the average time of first birth declines when age at marriage increases from a preadolescent to postadolescent age. The striking obser-

vation from Table 2 is that in the UP population the median first-birth interval is more than twice as long as that of the Kerala population in every single subgroup considered. In UP, the overall median first birth interval varies only by 0.3 months from 1978 to 1987 and is 23.6 to 23.9 months greater than in Kerala.
The proportion of women who have not conceived within ten years also reveals the differential timing of first birth among the subgroups considered. In Kerala, the proportion of women who have not conceived within ten years was below 3 per cent, whereas in UP, this proportion is nearly 10 per cent overall.
Results from the proportional hazard models are in Table 4. As ex-

pected, the four age-at-RM groups show statistical significance even after controlling for a number of socioeconomic factors. The relative risk of first birth in 1978 UP was 0.38, 0.60, and 0.68 for RM groups <13, 14-15, and 16-18 compared to the group married at 19 or after. The corresponding relative risks were nearly identical for Kerala. However, for the 1987 UP population the gap among the ageat-RM groups has been considerably reduced. For this population, the groups 14-15, 16-18, and 19 and above show only marginal differences.

marriage) and the first birth is often used as an index of fecundity (biological capacity to reproduce) of a population. The present analysis shows that the average first-birth interval varies by age at RM. The most striking result of the study is that within each RM age group, the UP population has nearly a 20-month longer duration than Kerala. Although Kerala women showed a shorter interval, even the overall mean birth interval of 20.3 months observed in Kerala is longer than that of many other populations. For example, Sheps

(1965) reported that in the Hutterite population the average first-birth interval is only 11.2 months. The mean firstbirth intervals of the UP population are much higher than what is observed in Western countries as well as in many developing countries, but are consistent with studies conducted in Northern India (Bhattacharya and Singh, 1983) as well as in Nepal and Bangladesh (Hobcraft and McDonald, 1984). It is interesting to examine some of the reasons for these wide disparities among different populations.

In Uttar Pradesh, besides other factors, oneor more of the following may be responsible for the observed trend in the average delay in the first-birth interval according to age at RMand the length of first-birth interval:
(1) Thejoint family system is prevalent in rural areas. Marriages areusually arranged byparents or elderly members of the household. Thus a couple starts their conjugal life in a joint family, only in later years becoming self-supporting and separating from theparental household. In joint families, couples get fewer chances of coition because of less privacy and more observance of rigid intercourse taboos.
(2) The probability of fetal death is rather high for females in their earlyadolescence and gradually declines until the age of 20. Information on fetal loss is not available in this study.
(3) The custom of frequent visits to parents in the early years of RM is even more frequent for brides marrying at younger ages.
(4) Some females attain menarche during the period of observation.
(5) The incidence of the adolescent subfecundity period defined by Henry (1966) as "a variable period of complete sterility after puberty orby a progressive increase infecundability upto maturity" may be high in the population.

The factors listed above may affect the Kerala population, especially the very young age groups, except that in Kerala couples usually live together after marriage. However, even inthe oldest age groups (19 and above), the observed median birth interval is quite long. Sheps (1965) noted that the Hutterite population has high levels of health and nutrition, which maybe responsible for their high fecundability and consequently short birth interval. The level of nutrition in Kerala is relatively lowcompared to Western standards. The role of nutrition factors in the Uttar Pradesh population also needs to be considered.
It is difficult to identify the inability of a couple to procreate, because sterility isonly suspected if, intheabsence of deliberate efforts to control fertility, a woman is unable to have any recognizable conception during a sufficiently long period after marriage. Here, estimates of the proportion of primarily sterile couples are obtained according to different age-at-RM groups from the calculated life tables. The proportion of females who have not given birth within ten years in age-at-RM groups appears in Table 2. Theestimate of the

298

proportion of females not having a birth within ten years is higher for ageat-RM Group I for both states because here we are observing females for up to 120 months (98 months in case of 1978 data) only, and if the observations are continued, some more will conceive. Several factors may be responsible for the slight increase in this proportion in age-at-RM Group IV. Rising age at marriage may make conception difficult. However, in UP, age at marriage is high in the upper castes, where the joint family system, level of education, migration of men to urban areas for employment, et cetera, are more prevalent. Thus a significant proportion of husbands of women in age-at-RM Group IV may be either students or in search of employment, delaying conception for a considerable period.
A number of studies have shown that the proportion of primarily sterile couples in India lies roughly between 2.4 and 10.5 per cent. Primary sterility is also found in Western countries, where the smallest value of age-specific percentages of couple sterility lies be-

tween 2 and 8. Based on data of the present survey for Uttar Pradesh and other surveys conducted in the same locality by S. N. Singh and his associates, estimates are that about 6 per cent of couples are primarily sterile (Bhattacharya and Singh, 1984; Bhattacharya et al., 1988). Thus, the estimates obtained for females of ageat-RM Groups II and III may be considered to be closer to true value. The low values of the proportion primarily sterile shows that most Indian women eventually conceive, but time to a live birth conception is on average, longer than in Western societies.
