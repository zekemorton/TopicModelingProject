ABSTRACT: Sociological research has found that educational attainment is the most important known determinant of men's occupational positions. Since the educational process occurs primarily while boys depend on their families, sociologists are increasingly interested in familial influences on education. This paper concentrates on the number of siblings in the family, and addresses two principal questions concerning the relation of sibship sire to educational outcomes. First, controlling for family background characteristics, does sibship size affect men's educational attainment and, if so, where in the educational process is this effect most evident? Second, among family variables, what is the relative importance of sibship size compared to the father's education, the father's socioeconomic status, farm background, and a broken family? Research was based on probability samples of 57,000 white men in the United States.

Holding constant factors such as race, the father's education plus his occupation plus the number of children in the family have been grouped together to indicate a major influence of family background on men's educational attainment.

The basic data for this analysis are the 1962 and 1973 surveys, Occupational Changes in a Generation (OCG, 1962, and OCG, 1973) conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, the General Social Survey 1973-1983 (GSS 72-83) conducted by the National Opinion Research Center of the University of Chicago, and finally, the 1970 National Fertility Study conducted by the Insti-

tute for Survey Research at Temple University (for the Office of Population Research at Princeton University and the Center for Demography and Ecology at the University of Wisconsin). The OCG surveys were national probability samples of men age 20-64 (OCG, 1962) and 20-65 (OCG, 1973). The total number of respondents in 1962 was 20,700, and in 1973, 33,613. The GSS is an annual probability sample of the adult population of all ages. For men, the pooled annual data (1972-83) total 6,984 respondents. The 1970 National Fertility Study data were derived from a probability sample of 6,752 evermarried female respondents aged 15-44 and concerned the women's husbands. Since the surveys oversampled blacks and the present analysis focuses on white males only, the total number of cases is reduced somewhat for each study, as is evident from the tables. Even so, the analysis is based on 56,484 cases in all. In addition to scale, the research has the advantage of replication on four separate data sets.
The family background variables used as controls in the multivariate analysis that follows are of major theoretical importance for educational attainment and number of siblings. Fathers' education and socioeconomic status have been associated negatively with the number of their offspring throughout U.S. history, and whether the father was a farmer (or worked on a farm) has been positively associated with family size. Equally, low parental education and socioeconomic status (and being a farmer or farm worker) have been related to low educational achievement for offspring. In general, coming from a broken family has had an independent negative effect on educational attainment, reflecting primarily the income disad-

vantage associated with being brought up in a female-headed household. Coming from a broken family has been particularly prevalent among only children. The respondent's age, an indicator of the period during which he grew up, isof course negatively associated with educational attainment (since the latter has risen over time), and positively associated with number of siblings (since the long-run trend in family size has been downward). In the present analysis, the father's socioeconomic status is measured by the Duncan socioeconomic index which converts detailed data on occupations into a continuous variable (Reiss, 1961). None of the data sets included information on the respondent's intelligence. The possible significance of this omission will be discussed subsequently. The term "sibsize" refers to the number of individuals' siblings. A man with no siblings (an only child) is designated as coming from "sibsize 0," a man with one sibling comes from "sibsize 1," etc. The distribution, by sibsize, of the men in each survey is shown in Table 1.
As for the dependent variables, initially I will discuss total years of educational attainment, and then break this experience down into components-- years of graded schooling (0-12), proportions completing high school, proportions of high school graduates going to college, and years of college schooling. In order to insure that men had completed their educational experience, the analysis of total years of education (0-17+ ), and years of college schooling, was based on men age 25 and over. The remaining analyses were performed on men age 20 and over. If this precaution had not been observed, a spuriously positive association between age and educational attainment among younger men would have been evident

RESULTS
SIBSIZE AND TOTAL YEARSOF
EDUCATION
The upper tier of Figure 1 summarizes the bivariate relation between sibsize and total years of education for the men in each survey. As may be seen, there is a marked linear relationship between sibsize and total years of education attained. The somewhat less distinguished performance of the only child, versus those having one sibling, is due to the effect of disproportionate numbers of broken families among only children.
The correlation ratios (etas) for the data presented in Figure 1 range between 0.298 and 0.389. Table 2 indicates that the difference in educational attainment between only children and those having six or more siblings is, in most surveys, close to a standard deviation. On average, taking all surveys com-

bined, this difference is 0.94 of a standard deviation. A less extreme comparison, contrasting respondents from two-child versus four-child (or larger) families (Table 2), shows that the difference is still very large--on average, 0.71 of a standard deviation.
Another way of looking at sibsize differences is to compare them with other types of variability in educational attainment to which we customarily attach importance, such as differences by race and age. During the mid-1970's in the United States, the black/white differential in years of education among men was 1.7 years (Current Population Reports, 1977). By age, the differential between those aged 25-29 and those aged 60-64 was 1.1 years among white men. During a comparable time period, our analysis of the GSS 1972-83 data (Figure 1and Table 3) shows that the educational gap between white men who were only children and those who had six or more siblings was 3.5 years. The gap for white men in the OCG 1973 study was 3.2 years. In effect, the difference be-

ferences in the bivariate and adjusted means for only children and those from families of seven or more; and for those from two-child families and those of four or more children. These results show that, even after adjustment, the difference for men between only children and those from families of seven or more is approximately two years of total education in relation to a grand mean of between 11 and 12 years, depending on the study. The adjusted sibsize difference between the smallest and largest families thus equals or exceeds the bivariate black-white difference among men during the 1970's in the United States referred to previously. The difference in adjusted means between men from families of two children and four or more is just slightly less than the bivariate black-white difference for men.
SIBSIZE AND THE EDUCATIONALPROCESS
At what point, or points, in the process of acquiring an education does sibsize intervene most importantly? Because of free schooling and compulsory education in the United States, one might think that the dilution of family resources resulting from many children would make little difference to educational attainment through high school, but that, after high school, sibsize would be a major determinant of who would go to college. Actually, our results are quite different from common-sense expectations. Sibsize has a major effect on educational attainment even during graded schooling (0-12). In fact, as we shall see, in most studies attainment is more highly correlated with sibsize at the graded level of schooling than at the postsecondary level.
Consequently, another aspect of the importance of sibsize for educational attainment is that it has exerted its effects

early in the schooling process. It has operated to select out a high proportion of students prior to high-school graduation, thereby cutting them off from further academic advancement. This finding suggests that sibsize operates not simply by diluting parental economic resources for postsecondary schooling, but by impinging on basic education at the graded level in a manner that includes both economic and noneconomic effects.1
Years of Graded Schooling.--Figure 2 shows, for all of our adult studies, the adjusted means for total years of graded schooling (0-12) by sibsize. As between only children and those from families of seven or more, it is typical for men to have lost a year or more of graded schooling. In judging the importance of such a deficit (all other factors in our analysis controlled), we must bear in mind that the loss of a year of graded schooling inevitably translated into large proportionate decrements in highschool graduation. Hence, the loss of a year of graded schooling, on average, can be judged asvery significant because of the importance of completing the last year of high school. We shall consider this next.
Proportions Graduatingfrom High School.--The unadjusted percentages graduating from high school according to sibsize are shown in the top tier of Figure 3. As can be seen, the magnitude of the differences between small and large families is very great. The absolute difference among men between one-child
1Clearly, there are real costs attached to keeping youngsters at school even through high school, since the child's time represents an opportunity cost for the parents and the child must be fed and clothed. Nonetheless, it does seem farfetched to suggest that children from large families drop out of graded schooling for economic reasons alone.

and seven-child (or larger) families varies between 27 and 41 percentage points (Table 4). Thus, among men, a comparison of one- or two-child and seven-ormore--child families shows small families to have about twice the proportion of high-school graduates as large families. Those from two-child families, as against those from families of four or more children, typically exhibit a 25 percentage point differential.
Turning to the adjusted means (the lower tier of Figure 3), the sibsize differences are somewhat attenuated but the relationship is more linear since some of the special disadvantages of only children are controlled. Despite the theoretical importance of the background variables for which we have adjusted, it is clear that the sibsize differences in high-school graduation remain large. Singleton boys are half again, or close to half again, as likely to graduate from high school as boys from families of seven children or more. The percentage

point differences in high-school graduation between singletons and those from families of seven or more, and between those from two child families and those from families of four or more children, are summarized in Table 4.
These data thus strongly reinforce the finding that total educational differentials by sibsize do not simply reflect relative advantage and disadvantage after high-school graduation. Even in the graded schooling years, and with major parental background variables controlled, increasing sibsize has deleterious consequences for educational attainment.
If the precocity of selection seems strange to some readers, they should refer to an article by Suter (1980) which deals with part of the process by which such early selection comes about. As Suter makes clear, the major reason so many men in the United States did not finish high school was because they fell behind (were "left back") early on--

If men have managed to enter college, does sibsize affect the number of years of college schooling they have been able to achieve? Figure 5 for the men in each study shows that the effects of sibsize are relatively small for this select group. That these effects exist at all, given the process of prior selection by sibsize that we have witnessed, is quite remarkable.
THE RELATIVE EFFECTS OF SIBSIZEON
GRADED AND SECONDARYEDUCATION
Our results so far, using Multiple Classification Analysis, suggest that as the level of schooling rises the effect of number of siblings decreases. The truth

of this is most succinctly exemplified by the unstandardized regression coefficients(slopes) for sibsize at each educational level. These are shown in Table 6. From this table it is clear that the effect of sibsize diminishes with each level of schooling, the greatest effect being at the graded-schooling level. We have suggested that the selection against large families that occurs so early in the educational process is probably due to two factors. One, outright schoolleaving (dropping out) among those from large families, and two, being "left-back" in high proportions among those from large families until droppingout occurs at a legally permissible age. Here we may note that this selection has important methodological implications for all research on the "effects" of num-

dent's own characteristics and performances (viewed as meritocratic). Thus absorbed into "background," number of siblings serves to overestimate the importance of paternal socioeconomic status (SES) and turn attention away from sibsize as an independent influence. For example, the following quotation from Alexander and Eckland is fairly typical of discussion of even those studies that have specifically included number of siblings as a predictor (Alexander and Eckland, 1980, p. 35).
More recent research, in revealing the range of advantages and liabilities conferred by the family of origin, serves only to broaden and deepen our appreciation of the residue of ascription in the supposed meritocracy (Blau and Duncan, 1967; Duncan et al., 1972; Hauser and Featherman, 1977).
To what is this persistent importance of the family attributed? Largely, it appears, to the simple fact that children from high SES families tend to go further through school than their low SES counterparts, and hence reap the labor market benefits that advanced schooling accrues.
A second reason for underestimating the relative importance of number of siblings to an individual's attainment is that models of status attainment (including those used here) treat parental SES as exogenous--in no way influenced by parental reproductive behavior. Yet parental educational attainment and occupational achievement are not independent of parental age at marriage and childbearing, including number of children. Hence, to the extent that parental SES is itself influenced by numbers of children, the effect of the respondent's sibsize on measures of parents' education and occupation is not counted.
Additionally, in so far as investigators have studied the educational process among high-school students (for ex-

ample, the high-school seniors in the Wisconsin Study, or the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Senior Class of 1972), the importance of number of siblings to postsecondary educational goals and attainment will appear relatively small (compared to other variables) because of the selection process by sibsize that has already taken place. Many youngsters from large families have already dropped out (or been held back), leaving a selected group of survivors from these families, whereas those from small families are less selected.
Finally, as a number of critics have noted (Scarr and Weinberg, 1977; Williams, 1976; and Spaeth, 1976) parental socioeconomic status is itself, in part, the translation of parental ability into socioeconomic currency. Were it possible to control for parental ability, the effect of parental SES on the son's achievement would probably be less and an additional effect of the parental ability transmitted to the child would be added. This point, which is increasingly being addressed by economists and sociologists (see, for example, Griliches, 1970; Griliches and Mason, 1972;Taubman and Wales, 1974; Welch, 1974;Bowles, 1973; Bowles and Nelson, 1974; Bowles and Gintis, 1974; Eckland, 1967; Griffin, 1976; Hauser and Daymont, 1977) cannot be discussed further here.
Here we will examine the relative effects of sibsize and other background variables for the adults in some of our samples. Table 7 shows, for OCG, 1962, and 1973 as well as GSS 1972-1983, the standardized coefficients of the principal variables in our model for each level of the respondent's educational attainment. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the standardized coefficients for disaggregated amounts of education

CONCLUSION

since data are not available on either IQ or school performance. However, other parts of our analysis have shown that, among samples of youngsters, the effects of sibsize on IQ are substantial, especially among samples of very young children (Blake, in press). Hence, one can speculate that the early drop-out rate among men from large families was not due entirely to the diluting effect of sibsize on material resources, but that it was due as well to sibsize effects on IQ, and the influence of the latter on school performance. It should be noted also that men whose fathers were farmers (farm background in the equations) experienced some relatively important negative effects at the graded-schooling level. Thus, although in general the father's occupational status was unimportant for graded schooling, having a father who was a farmer was a disadvantage.

I have analyzed the effects of number of siblings on total years of education, years of graded schooling, proportions graduating from high school, proportions of high school graduates going to college, and years of college schooling. Even after controlling for family background variables, I have found differences by sibsize in level of total education that rival simple bivariate educational differences by race and age. Those from large versus small families lose about a year of graded schooling on average, which translates into large differences in proportions graduating from high school. Hence, although it seems logical to think that the deleterious effect of large families centers on chances for postsecondary education, the actual fact is that the greatest effect is early in people's schooling--in the grades. Since there are marked negative effects of in-

among many children, affects the dropout rates among those from large families.
Sibsize influences college attendance much less than it influences graded schooling. I believe that this finding reflects the biases introduced by the marked selection out of large families at the graded schooling level. Those children from large families who have made it through high school are a sample of survivors. They are quite probably highly selected for IQ, motivation, performance, and whatever other factors contribute to college attendance.
If sibsize is important as a predictor of educational attainment, how does its importance rank relative to that of other predictors in the family background model? For total years of education and years of graded schooling, the father's education ranks first and sibsize second. The father's SEI ranks third for total years, but it is unimportant for graded schooling. By contrast, college schooling depends more on the father's SEI

than on his education or on sibsize. These results may be surprising for some students of educational mobility, since there has been a tendency to lump sibsize with the parents' education and the father's occupation as "socioeconomic background," and to assume, thereby, more importance for socioeconomic effects in the "macro" sense than seems justified. It is one thing to look at socioeconomic effects controlling for sibsize, and another to aggregate a major predictor like sibsize into the overall effects of socioeconomic status.
