ABSTRACT: Causal models of the effects of maternal age on offspring intelligence were generated using three large data sets. The direct and indirect effects of two components of maternal age, teenage motherhood and linear maternal age, were investigated separately for white and black children. The intervening variables investigated as routes of indirect effect were family structure, parental education, parental employment, family income, and family size. The findings indicate that there are no direct effects of teenage maternity on offspring intelligence, and that the observed negative relationship is primarily attributable to parental education. In contrast, the overall effect of maternal age, while very small and positive, is primarily direct, that is, not mediated by any of the social or economic conditions included in the model. The consistency of these findings and the impact on children's intelligence of the other variables included in the model are demonstrated and discussed.

which there were sufficient data for reliable estimates. The birth order effect was approximately 2.5 points decrease for each increase in birth order within maternal age groups. Recognizing the partial redundancy of maternal age and birth order with social class, the authors divided the sample into three social class groups. Although the apparent relationships were not much diminished, the authors recognized the considerable social class heterogeneity remaining within the classification and conservatively stated that "the evidence is . . . consistent with the conclusion that the relationship . . . reflects largely the association of (maternal age and birth rank) with social class" (p. 67).
A recent study was conducted (Card, 1978) in which Project Talent data collected in 1960 were employed to assess the affects of teenaged parenthood on the academic aptitude scores of offspring in Grades 9-12. In this study a small but statistically significant disadvantage attributable to teenaged parents was found, net of other factors, amounting to a difference of approximately 3lApoints.1 The offspring being tested in the Project Talent study, however, were born in the early 1940's, and one may well question the generalization of these findings to more recent cohorts. Given the substantial change in the educational and occupational status of women and the stability of family structure over the intervening period, it seems likely that some alteration in this pattern may be evident.
This paper is the second in a sequence of studies exploring the psychological consequences for children born to teenage mothers. The first paper (Belmont et al., 1981) was concerned, like this one, with

the intellectual consequences as measured by intelligence test score. By the use of three large independently generated data sources all based on U.S. children, we showed (1) that children born of teenage mothers scored lower on the average on the WISC than did children born of older mothers, and (2) that this disadvantage to children of teenage mothers was almost entirely accounted for by the disadvantageous situation of the mother with respect to socioeconomic and educational status. After controlling for demographic variables relating to the parents (education, income, family structure, location) and the child (age, sex, race, twin status, birth order, number of siblings), there remained a small relationship between offspring intelligence and mother's age. Even this extremely slight relation was linear across the range of maternal age and showed no particular disadvantage for children of the teenage woman.
With confidence stemming from the consistency of results across data sets and within subpopulations, we interpreted these findings as demonstrating beyond reasonable doubt that the offspring of teenaged mothers suffer virtually no depression in intelligence test score that can be attributed solely and specifically to the teenage status of the mothers. To the extent that the scores are depressed, associated social disadvantages--well documented elsewhere and amply confirmed in the populations we studied--are likely to be the major cause.
We turn in this second paper to a more detailed consideration of these social disadvantages and their relation to intelligence test scores in the offspring. Thus, we present here empirical estimates of the extent to which the observed associations of age of mother with offspring intelligence were mediated by social disadvantages (for instance, maternal education, family structure, family size, income)

which are themselves in part outcomes of maternal age at birth. We will be especially concerned with associations affecting the offspring of teenage mothers. In order to make the estimates, we have set out in a basic model the likely causalflow between elements of social disadvantage, maternal age, and offspring intelligence.
The model, and our reasons for electing it, are described below. The data sources were reviewed in the first paper and will be sketched here only briefly. We note that the papers diverge slightly in the definition of some of the variables.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
THE ANALYTIC MODEL
The basic model posits that age of childbearing has an effect on family structure, parental education, and employment. All of these variables may in turn affect family income and family size, and

finally any or all of the variables may have an effect on children's IQ scores.
Causal models are hypothetical representations of the influences of certain variables and conditions on the probabilities or levels of other variables or conditions. As such, they are founded on presumed temporal priority, on mechanisms coherent with previous research findings, or on commonsense assumptions.
The causal model employed in this study is represented in Figure 1. The variables to the extreme left--birth order, singleton or twin, sex, linear maternal age, and teenage maternity--are the first tier variables. Birth order is placed in the firsttier in order to allow for the examination of the effects of maternal age within all birth order groups (for any given birth order). Previous research (Record et al., 1969) has demonstrated the value of this strategy, which has two consequences. One is that is creates a proxy for age atfirst birth, since the ages of women at the time

of births of a given parity appear to be determined in large part by age at the birth of first children. The second effect is to permit a finer specification of the family size variable in the third tier. Since birth order conveys the number of children born prior to the study child, family size, when simultaneously considered, reflects the number born after the study child.
These variables and the relationships among them are the starting point for the study and no causal explanation is offered for them.
The set of variables second from the left; family structure, parental education, and parental employment are the second tier variables. These variables are measured at the time of the survey and therefore may have been affected by the temporally prior first tier variables. The causal impact of teenaged childbearing and, more generally, age of mother on the likelihood of current unmarried status is both plausible and well documented. In addition to the high risk of out-of-wedlock status for children of teenaged mothers (Cutright, 1971), the greater divorce and separation rates for early marriage are well known (Bumpass, 1972; Glick and Norton, 1977). The possible causal impact of the child characteristics--birth order, twin, and sex--is more conjectural and of little interest here. The purpose of these variables is to control for effects which might otherwise be inaccurately attributed to the maternal age variables.
The assumption that maternal education is causally dependent on teenaged childbearing and maternal age, although common (Jaffe, 1977), is somewhat more troublesome. The association between these variables is well known. Three published studies have attempted to determine the magnitude of the causal effects involved. Although in each case the population under investigation and the maternal age variables differed from the

current study, all three determined that some or all of the maternal-age-maternal-education association was not due to an effect of the former on the latter. Card (1978) removed some of this effect as spurious and due to the fact that both are in part influenced by the social class of the mother's family of origin. Hofferth and Moore (1979) essentially agree with this assessment, although their sample frame, population, and causal modeling techniques are quite different. Rindfuss et al. (1980) conclude from their analysis that most or all of this relationship is attributable to the effect of education on age at first birth.However, the variables used in the current study differ from the 1970 National Fertility Study used by Rindfuss et al. in a number of important ways. First, the current studies all sample children rather than mothers, and the maternal age variable is age at the birth of the study child, who is not necessarily the first. Second, maternal education is taken at the time of the examination of the study child and thus may include education subsequent to childbearing.
None of the data sets examined here were sufficiently rich in variables which might have been used as instruments in a reciprocal causal analysis to allow for a nonrecursive model. For this reason we have chosen to estimate the effects of maternal age as if they were determining of education. However, in a later section of the paper we recompute the effects employing the estimates provided by the analyses of other authors. Thisflexibility and carry over of causal modeling techniques is, indeed, one of its most attractive features.
In explicating the maternal age effect on childhood IQ we ignore interrelationships among the second tier variables, concerning ourselves only with causal relationships that flow from the first tier variables. For this reason the causal model

142

may be considered an incomplete one; indirect effects operating through variables in the same tier are omitted. We limit ourselves in this way because reciprocal causation and unmeasured common causes are virtually certain to exist among some or all of the variables within tiers.
The next set of variables--annual family income and family size--are the third tier variables. All first and second tier variables are considered as potential causes of these variables. The logical priority of second tier variables seem fairly obvious. Again, interrelations between third tier variables are ignored.
The final dependent variable is the child's IQ. We include all first, second, and third tier variables as potential influences on IQ level.
Causal analysis requires that one assume that there are no variables omitted which have nontrivial and independent effects on both measured cause and effect. In this study the most probable unmeasured common causes are grandparental social class, which influences both maternal education and early childbearing (Card, 1978), and mother's IQ, which influences age of first childbearing and maternal education (Hofferth and Moore, 1979). These errors appear on the face of it to be more likely to affect the validity of our estimates on offspring IQ in the case of teenaged mothers than of mothers throughout the age range. Later in the paper we will estimate the probable magnitude of the impact of these specification errors on our model. Two other sources of common causes of variables in the model are geographic regional differences and age of the child. These variables have been employed as controls in the current analyses but will not be reported on here.
To recapitulate, we expect that there will be a small direct path from linear maternal age to child's IQ and no direct path

from teenage maternity. The main purpose of the path model is therefore to weigh the likely distinctive contributions of the indirect effects, mediated through family structure, parental employment and education, and family size and income, to the observed raw association of linear maternal age, teenage maternity, and child's IQ. Because these estimates are based on three very large samples we expect them to have narrow confidence bands. In the same vein, the high statistical power allows us to be unusually confident that even very modest sources of influence can be identified and thus gives more weight than usual to "null"findings.
DATA SOURCES
The data sources have been fully described in our first paper (Belmont et al., 1981). Briefly, three data sets have been used, the Health Examination Survey (HES) Cycles II and III of the National Center for Health Statistics, and the Collaborative Perinatal Project (CPP) of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke. In the HES data sets, respondents were randomly selected from a sampling frame designed to provide a representative national sample. The CPP, on the other hand, gathered data on women attending prenatal clinics of participating hospitals. Most of these hospitals were large urban teaching hospitals. They were predominantly but not exclusively located in the Northeast section of the country. The characteristics of the data sources are presented in Table 1, and the definitions of variables in the data sources are given in Table 2.
The sample consisted of all children for whom we had data on the age of mother obtained from the birth certificate for the HES samples and age at registration for prenatal care in the CPP. In addition, the analyses of the CPP sample were carried

variables between independent and dependent variable) from those termed indirect (which operate through measured intervening variables). Since we know the direct effect of maternal age on child's IQ (mediated through Linear Maternal Age, and quite small), the main interest here is to estimate the indirect effects of this relationship. Thus, estimates of effects from one tier to the next and the consistency with which such effects are shown across the six populations should contribute to an understanding of process.
We present below the relations of the first tier variables (specfically, the maternal age variables) on the second tier

variables (Table 4), followed by the relations between the first and second tier variables on the third tier variables (Tables 5 and 6) and the direct effects of all first, second, and third tier variables on IQ of the child (Table 7).

pies there seemed to be a significant tendency for the children of teenaged mothers to live in "broken" homes, i.e., homes not headed by both biological parents. This tendency is strongest inthe HES Cycle II data, with 11and14 percent excess risk forwhite and black childrenrespectively. TheCycle IIIblack sampledid not show an excess risk of broken homes for the older children (age range 12-17 years) of teenaged mothers. In theCPP data sets the differential risk was onlyone half as large as the Cycle II values. Teenage maternity had a large effect on the education of mothers infiveof six samples. As before, theCycle IIIblack sample was the exception. The other two black samples hadmuch smaller effects than the white samples. This maybe explained by

the fact that theoverall low level of education of black mothers, 9.3and9.4years in Cycle II and III respectively, meant that even early childbearing would typically postdate the completion of education for these women. A similar explanation is offered for race differences in the effect of teenaged motherhood on paternal education. Only in the more recent CPP sample does the educational level ofblack parents begin to be high enough to be influenced by childbearing.
The effects of teenaged motherhood on maternal employment are inconsistent. Teenage Maternity was therefore clearly associated with a greater risk of broken home and lower parental education but not consistently with maternal employment.

FamilyIncome.--Table 5shows the estimated effects of all prior variables on family income. With regard to the maternal age variables, they rarely had a significant effect on family income. When they were present, the signs of these effects were in opposite directions and effects were of modest size, all of which lead us to doubt their prognostic significance.
In contrast to the maternal age variables, parental education, employment, and the presence of a male guardian had large effects on the annual incomes of families. The tendency for the Cycle II

coefficients to be smallest and the CPP coefficients to be largest maybe partially explained by the effects of inflation which occurred from the data collection forCycle II beginning in 1963to the CPP data collection which ended in 1973. Inflation does not explain the differences in effects for white and black samples, however. Each additional year of paternal education brought only 50 to60 percent asmuch increase in family income for black families asfor white families. Maternal education also had comparably smaller consequences for black family income of children in the HES samples; in the CPP data set this difference disappeared. Parental employment had effects on the family income of all samples in which it

was measured; differences between race effects are not consistent. As anticipated, the effects of paternal employment are larger than those of maternal employment, reflecting the greater earning capacity of males. The effects on family income of no male guardian were large in all samples; as would be expected, they were larger in the white samples than in the black samples, a finding again reflecting differences in earning capacity. The effects of other family structure variations were inconsistent. Birth order tended to have a positive relationship with family income when measured during elementary school years. One possible explanation for this is that it reflects difference in the ages

of fathers which are predictive of differential income.
These variables jointly accounted for about 40 to 50 per cent of the variance in annual family income. The multiple correlation was consistently higher in white samples than in black samples.
Family Size.--Table 6 presents the direct effect of all prior variables on family size. As anticipated, maternal age at this birth was related to the probability of subsequent births in all samples. The number of subsequent children declined about one child for each additional ten years of mother's age. The Teenage Maternity effect was not significant in any of the HES samples, indicating that teenage mothers'

subsequent childbearing was at the rate expected for their age. In the CPP samples, however, teenage mothers had fewer subsequent births than would have been expected--on the average, 0.26 fewer in the white sample and 0.38 fewer in the black sample.
Parental education had modest negative effects on the number of subsequent children in all samples. Maternal employment had rather large negative effects on the number of subsequent children, and these effects were consistently larger in the black samples than in the white samples. Mother only (no male guardian)

families in the CPP samples had fewer younger children (see above). Other family constellations--families headed by grandparents, other relatives, or nonrelatives--had more younger children than did families headed by the natural parents in all HES samples. This effect was especially large in the black sample. Other family structure effects varied from sample to sample.
In the Cycle II and CPP samples family size was substantially related to the predictors, which accounted for 48 to 59 per cent of its variance. In the Cycle III data, family size was not so related to the pre-

dictors and a reasonable explanation of this resides in its probable low validity.2
THE DIRECT EFFECTS OFALL
VARIABLES ON IQ
The direct effects of all variables in the model on the child's IQ are presented in Table 7. In no sample was there a significant direct effect of Teenage Maternity on the child's IQ. The Linear Maternal Age effect was, however, significant in five of six samples. The exception was the Cycle III black sample. This effect was modest in size, ranging from 0.09 to 0.21 IQ points per year of maternal age. The standard deviation of maternal age within birth order groups ranged from about five to about six years. Thus, an increase in mother's age of about one standard deviation led to an increase in the IQ of the offspring of no more than about one IQ point. Apparent race differences in these effects in no case reached statistical significance.
The effects of maternal education on IQ were significant in all six samples. They were much larger than the Linear Material Age effects in the sense that a year's delay in childbearing had less consequence than an additional year of education. The effects exceeded one IQ point per year of maternal education in all white samples; these effects were much smaller in the black samples. The effects of paternal education were smaller than those of maternal education, and the race differences in magnitudes were not so marked.
Maternal employment was significant
2 The only available indicator of family size was the number of persons in the household under the age of 20. Since the study children were ages 12-17, in many families older siblings would already have left the household and/or reached the age of 20. Thus, the average family size, as measured, was smallest in this sample, in spite of the fact that unlike the other samples these families would be predominantly complete and historically expected to be at least as large as those of the other samples.

in three samples. It had an apparent deleterious effect (--1.56 IQ points) on children's IQ's in the Cycle II white sample, but a positive effect in both CPP samples.
In the two samples of young white children from Cycle II and the CPP there was a negative effect of father absence, of 3.40 and 2.46 IQ points respectively. A smaller negative effect was significant in the CPP black sample. Other family structure effects were inconsistent.
Twins examined in each of the six samples had lower IQ's than would have been expected. The estimate of this effect ranged from 3.14 IQ points to 6.71 IQ points and was consistently larger in the black samples.
Family income had a significant effect on the child's IQ in all samples. The size of this effect ranged from over one IQ point per thousand dollars in the Cycle II samples to about one-third of an IQ point in the CPP samples. Some portion of this discrepancy may be attributable to inflation occurring between the data collection periods. However, even adjusted for inflation, the earlier estimates would probably be twice the size of the more recent effects. This raises the question as to whether there was a trend toward decreasing the role of family income in the availability of intelligence enhancing resources over this period. Alternatively, this difference may reflect a difference in the effects of income in urban samples (CPP) as compared to a broad national sample.
A birth order effect on intelligence was inconsistent and present in only two samples. The negative effect of family size on IQ was significant in all six samples, although the magnitude of the effect varied across samples.
In summary, the results presented in Tables 4-7 show that Teenage Maternity was associated with a greater risk of broken homes and lower parental education.

The variable had no consistent direct effects on income or family size or on IQ. Linear Maternal Age had a consistent effect on family size and child's IQ.
CAUSAL PATHWAYS
As previously stated, a major goal of the current study was to provide estimates of indirect effects. These effects are determined as products of effects as traced from the origin to the ultimate dependent variable and then summed across alternate paths. For example, for the Cycle II white children the indirect effect of Teenage Maternity via the father's employment variable is --0.043 (the effect on father's employment) times -0.30 (the effect of father's employment on family size) times -1.05 (the effect of family size on IQ) = -0.01, plus -0.043 times 1.14 (the effect of father's employment on income) times 1.03 (the effect of income on IQ) = 1.05, or -0.06.
In Table 8 the direct and indirect effects of Teenage Maternity in all six samples are summarized. Since all numbers are in IQ units we may directly compare their

values. The most striking effects come from the lowered parental education attributable to teenaged motherhood in the white samples amounting to 2.4-3.3 IQ points. Changes in family structure associated with teenage maternity have very little effect on IQ level, never as large as half an IQ point. The positive effect on IQ via the tendency of the most recent cohorts of teenaged mothers to have fewer subsequent children than would have been expected is small but encouraging. Finally, it should be said that the effects for the most recent cohort of black children in the CPP look much more like those for the white children than did earlier cohorts.
In Table 9 the direct and indirect effects of Linear Maternal Age on IQ are summarized. Each effect is stated as a change in IQ per year of maternal age. Unlike the previous table in which no direct effects were significant, direct effects dominate the Linear Maternal Age findings. The major source of indirect effect is family size, which as noted earlier is a measure of births subsequent to the study child once

we partial the effects of birth order. These effects are partly counterbalanced by small negative effects attributable to cohort effects on education. Other effects are quite small and inconsistent. The direct effects are much closer in value than are the total effects, which appear to be more sensitive to cohort and/or age of child effects.
DISCUSSION
Each of the samples analyzed in this research led to the conclusion that to the extent that Teenage Maternity affects offspring it does so by means of parental education. As noted earlier, two variables which we were unable to include in our analysis may well alter our estimates of the effects of teenaged motherhood on educational attainment.
One variable is the socioeconomic status of the family of origin of the mothers. Girls from lower class homes may be both less inclined and able to opt for more education and more inclined to opt for early childbearing (or less able to avoid it). The second possible confounding variable is maternal IQ. It is reasonable to suppose

that maternal IQ will directly affect her own educational achievement and also her child's IQ. In addition, it may affect her decision to bear children while still young (or her ability to avoid so doing).
Fortunately, we may use the estimates generated in Card's (1978) study of Project Talent data to remove the "spurious" portion of the estimate of the effect of teenaged motherhood on education. According to Card's model which uses standardized coefficients, parental social class had an effect on childbearing history (as of age 29) of --0.15 and on educational attainment of 0.11; academic aptitude (here an appropriate surrogate for maternal IQ) had effects of --0.17 on childbearing history and 0.41 on educational attainment. Card estimates the direct effect of childbearing history on educational attainment to be 0.38. If one uses the standard deviations of the variables in the present project to convert these standardized coefficients, the resulting estimates suggest that about half of the estimated effect of teenaged motherhood on mother's education may be attributable to these common causes.
A second study by Hofferth and Moore (1979) also investigated a causal model us-

ing these variables, this time employing data from the National Longitudinal Study of the Labor Market Experiences of Young Women of the U.S. Department of Labor and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics funded by the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. In this investigation the causal model employed explicitly assumed that in addition to an effect of teenaged motherhood on maternal education, one would find an effect of education on the probability of early motherhood. Because of noncomparability of sampling frames, cohorts, and method of analysis we cannot directly employ the resulting estimates to "correct" our model. However, there are two aspects of the Hofferth and Moore model which may be helpful in assessing our model. First, they estimate teenage childbearing and maternal education to have causal effects on each other of approximately similar magnitude. Second, according to their model the effects of parental social class operated entirely through the educational variable and did not have a direct effect on age at first birth. It would be reasonable to suppose that prior academic achievement would also operate on childbearing through the education variable.
Taken together, these findings might lead us to estimate that about half of the estimated effect of Teenage Maternity on maternal education in the current study could be considered a true causal effect. Passing this coefficient along, and given the dominance of the educational variables in accounting for the differences in mean IQ between children of teenaged mothers and older mothers, we might expect the overall indirect effect through maternal education to be about half as large as those provided in Table 8. If we were to use the Rindfuss et al. (1980) estimate that the maternal-age-maternaleducation effect is entirely attributable to

the causal impact of the latter on the former, we would have to consider all of the "indirect" effect through this route to be spurious. No causal analysis of the effects of maternal age at first birth and paternal education (controlling for maternal education) were found in the literature. Thus, the indirect effect through paternal education may tentatively be considered nonspurious.
On the other hand, the Linear Maternal Age effect on children's IQ was predominantly a direct effect, not mediated by social or demographic factors.
CONCLUSION
The path analytic model presented here allows us to disentangle the relations between two maternal age variables (Linear Maternal Age and Teenage Maternity) and child's IQ. We show that Linear Maternal Age has a direct effect on child's IQ, which though consistent is very small and which is neither increased nor decreased when other variables are introduced. By contrast, Teenage Maternity has no direct effect on child's IQ, but has a marked association with parental education which can be shown in turn to have a significant effect on child's IQ. Thus, educational level of the young parents accounts almost entirely for the disadvantage in terms of IQ of the offspring of teenaged mothers.
Surprisingly, there was little or no effect of differences in family structure on the IQ of offspring of teenage mothers. This was true in spite of the commonness of the deviant household pattern in which they were found to live.
A reasonable interpretation of our findings is that if youthful childbearing were not necessarily to be associated with interrupted education, then the offspring would suffer little or no disadvantage in terms of IQ. It seems that in terms of off-

154

spring IQ any biological disadvantage of very early motherhood (a direct effect) is at most trivial. Constructive interventions that emphasize continuing education adapted to the circumstances of the teenaged mothers would seem to have a useful place.
On the other hand, the relatively small IQ disadvantage to offspring of teenage mothers is noted. Teenage childbearing

may handicap the parents more gravely than it does their offspring.
