ABSTRACT: Most studies of childlessness in the United States have relied on unrepresentative, opportunistic samples collected in a variety of ways. Thus, the relationship of various correlates to childlessness is not well known. Some studies have focused on demographic variables, but have not examined attitudinal factors associated with childlessness--something the opportunistic samples have been able to do. In this paper we examine both attitudinal and demographic factors associated with childlessness in the United States. The data used in this paper are from the National Survey of Families and Households collected in 1987 and 1988. The data set includes both demographic data, perceived advantages and disadvantages of having children, and attitudinal data about related social issues. Overall, the rate of voluntary childlessness was not high. Only 3.5 per cent of the men and 2.8 per cent of the women reported that they were childless and did not expect to have children. Only one category of people (unmarried men and women over the age of 35) had rates that exceeded ten per cent. A combined variable of age and marital status was the best predictor of childlessness. A scale of reasons orjustifications for having children was the next best predictor. In addition, attendance at religious services, number of hours the respondents desired to work and education (for women only) were related to childlessness. Those who scored highly on measures of support for traditional families and support of extended families also tended to have lower rates of childlessness. Occupational status, religious denomination, and race, on the other hand, were not significantly related to childlessness. Measures of gender equality, religious fundamentalism, and support for mothers working were also not related to childlessness.

Veevers, 1979), past research has demonstrated that relatively few people have actually remained childless. Furthermore, the rate of childlessness has remained relatively low (see Houseknecht, 1987; Jacobson et al., 1988), although there are some indications that it may have risen recently (Rindfuss et al., 1988). Thus, the changes in the demographic composition of American society, trends toward gender equality, changing attitudes about familial issues, and delayed childbearing may yet result in increased rates of childlessness.
Several researchers have investigated voluntary childlessness in America over the past few decades, including its incidence, correlates and predictors, and its effects. The most common articles simply describe the rate of total childlessness or demographic predictors of childlessness. Less commonly, articles focus on "statements of motive," or reasons for childlessness. Examination of total rates of childlessness, however, confounds two separate phenomena, infecundity and voluntary childlessness. Voluntary childlessness is defined as having no children and not expecting to have any. In the present paper, we focus on demographic, attitudinal, and motivational correlates of voluntary childlessness.
Few of the previous studies have relied on systematic national samples. Most have been descriptive or exploratory and have utilized opportunistic or purposive samples. Such studies have examined a variety of correlates of childlessness. Unfortunately, such studies have limited generalizeability. Both the estimates of the rates of childlessness and the relationship of the correlates are unreliable.
A review of 47 studies of voluntary childlessness in the United States published prior to 1986 found onlyfivestud-

ies based on representative samples (Houseknecht, 1987). Of the five, four were published in the late 1970's; the fifth was published in 1954. And, the sample sizes were small since the childless constitute only a small proportion of all married women. The five representative samples ranged in size from 18 to 119.
Roughly a dozen studies have been published in the years since the Houseknecht review, but the lack of good, recent, and representative samples persists. Only four of the published studies done recently utilized representative samples. One (Poston and Kramer, 1986) examined only Catholic and non-Catholic differences and their data were collected in 1976. Catholic women were less likely to be voluntarily childless even after controlling for marital status, religious attendance, age, and educational attainment.
The second representative study (Jacobson et al., 1988) had a larger sample of voluntarily childless women--363 women aged 20-44. Voluntarily childless women were those who had no children and did not expect to have any. The data included good measures of the demographic variables but no attitudinal questions or questions about perceived value or problems associated with having children. Thus, comparisons about the relationship of these variables along with the demographic variables could not be made.
The third study (Heller et al., 1986) developed social-psychological profiles of voluntarily and involuntarily childless individuals in the General Social Survey in 1977 and 1978. They developed good measures of social-psychological variables, but did not control for any demographic characteristics, and they did not compare their sample to couples with children. They did not make clear

The findings from this study (Heller et al., 1986) were contrary to those that most previous researchers, using nonrandom samples, had found. For example, the voluntarily childless were less tolerant of deviant behaviors, lesspolitically liberal, less liberal toward women's rights, and less involved with nonrelatives than the nonvoluntarily childless. They were, however, more liberal in

their lifestyle, more confident about earning a living, and less involved in interaction with relatives than the nonvoluntarily childless. These types of factors need to be examined further with representative samples. In addition, males and females need to be examined separately and compared to individuals with children and not just to the nonvoluntarily childless.

The analysis will be done separately for men and women. Little work has been done with males. Only 20 of the 47 studies reviewed by Houseknecht (1987) examined males. Some had as few as 11 respondents. Only 3 studies had more than 74 males, and two of those studies were done before World War II. When results were reported for both sexes, some important differences

nomination, attendance at religious services, race or ethnicity, and number of hours respondents prefer to work.
Age has been shown to be related to childlessness since older women who are still childless become involved in other activities such as careers. Furthermore, they come to realize that the opportunities for children are decreasing. Decisions to delay fertility are often modified and couples may decide to remain childless (Rindfuss et al., 1988). Marriage is still associated with childbearing for most people and thus single individuals are more likely to indicate that they expect to remain childless.
Childless men and women in the past have typically been those of high occupational and educational status. Commitments in these endeavors seem to preclude large family size and often result in delayed childbirth. The result is significantly higher rates of childlessness among these groups. A desire for fulltime employment (hours worked) also reflects career commitment and is expected to be associated with higher rates of childlessness.
Cultural norms of ethnic and religious subgroups may also influence childbearing. Those who are religiously affiliated and attend church frequently are more likely to be in the mainstream of American society and thus are less likely to remain childless. Pro-natalist norms among Catholics have resulted, until recently, in higher rates of childbearing among them than among Protestants. Blacks tend to marry younger than whites, have first intercourse at a younger age, and are more likely to have children out of wedlock. For these reasons, researchers have tended tofind lower rates of childlessness among blacks than whites. Previous research has shown these variables to be related

to childlessness (for reviews of this literature, see Houseknecht, 1987;Jacobson et al., 1988).
Most social scientists assume that behavior is the product of social structure, and also motivation. Thus, many researchers have examined reasons or "statements of motive" individuals give for having children or remaining childless. The respondents in the current data were asked about a series of reasons for having children. "Reasons" that were related to childlessness included: "my age," "having someone to love," "uncertainty about my ability to support a child," "the stress and worry of raising children," "having time for leisure and social activities," and "having time and energy for my career." Houseknecht (1987), in her comprehensive review of articles on voluntary childlessness, found 29 studies that had examined rationales for not having children. Twenty-three of them had found freedom from childcare responsibility or greater opportunity to be related to childlessness. Sixteen had found female career considerations and monetary advantages to be related to childlessness. Only nine had found early socialization experiences or doubts about ability to parent related to childlessness. Though not all of the studies examined all the rationales or reasons we have included, most of the reasons have been at least mentioned in the literature.
Given the current changes in gender equality and family composition in American society, we would expect several attitudinal variables to be related to childlessness. The attitudinal variables included in the analysis are: gender equality, attitudes about premarital sex, support for mothers working, belief in traditional family arrangements, belief that extended families should support

covariates. Multiple classification analysis evaluates whether the predictor variables distinguish between the childless and the childed. The procedure is similar to regression analysis in that multiple variables can be assessed and effects controlled for all other independent variables simultaneously. The independent variables are not required to be interval level, however, and the rate of childlessness in each discrete category of the predictor variables can be ascertained.

By standard definitions, the childless are those who have no children and report not intending to have any. The scale measuring reasons for having children was not given to all respondents. Only females age 39 or younger and males who were married or cohabitating with a woman age 39 or younger were asked to fill out the questionnaire that asked about reasons for having children. Males 45 or younger who were not married or cohabitating were also included. A separate category was created for those older respondents selected out by

zero, less than 20, 20-34, 35-40, and more than forty hours per week. Religious affiliation was grouped as Catholic, Baptist, other mainline Protestants, fundamentalists, and other. Church attendance was grouped to reflect weekly or more frequent attendance, attendance several times a month, a few times per year, and never.
Marital status and age were combined as follows. Those who were in a first marriage were grouped separately as were those who were in a second or higher marriage. Those who were divorced, widowed, or separated were grouped together. The never-married were then separated by age: 18-24,2534, and 35 or older.
The scale measuring reasons for having children asked respondents (on a scale of 1 to 7) "how important you feel each (consideration) is to you at present time." As indicated earlier, the important considerations were: age, uncertainty about ability to support a child, the stress and worry of raising children, having time for leisure or social activities, having someone to love, and having time and energy for their careers. When run in a separate analysis, however, some items did not scale in the expected direction. If the respondents thought age, stress, having leisure time, and time for career were important, they were more likely to be childless. These were scored negatively on the reasons scale. On the other hand, those who said "ability to support a child" and "needing someone to love" were important were less likely to be childless. These items were scored positively such that higher scores indicate a more pronatal attitude structure and low scores indicate a more antinatal one.
The responses from three questions were combined to obtain the measure of

support for mothers working (eigenvalue = 2.37, per cent variance = 59). The respondents were asked if they approved or disapproved of mothers working part-time and full-time when the youngest child is under age 5, and whether they approved or disapproved of children under 3 years old being cared for all day in a day care center.
Five items constituted the sexual liberation scale: whether they approved or disapproved of "women having a child without getting married," whether or not "it is all right for an unmarried couple to live together even if they have no interest in considering marriage," and whether or not "it is all right for unmarried 18-year-olds to have sexual relations if they have strong affection for each other." The final two items for the scale were: "Married couples ought to overlook isolated occasions of sexual unfaithfulness," and "It is all right for an unmarried couple to live together as long as they have plans to marry." The eigenvalue for the scale was 2.53 and the factor accounted for 51 per cent of variance in the items.
The measure of religious fundamentalism was composed of similar Likerttype items (eigenvalue = 2.24, 75 per cent variance). The three items were: "The Bible is God's word and everything happened or will happen exactly as it says," "The Bible is the answer to all important human problems," and "I regard myself as a religious fundamentalist."
Five similar items composed the measure of support for traditional family lifestyle (eigenvalue = 2.11, percent variance = 42). The items were: "It is much better for everyone if the man earns the main living and the woman takes care of the home and family," "It's better for a person to get married than to

go through life being single," "Marriage is a lifetime relationship and should never be ended except under extreme circumstances," "It's better for a person to have a child than to go through life childless," and "Children have fewer problems with two natural parents than with one natural parent and one stepparent."
An additional five items measured support for extended family arrangements (eigenvalue = 1.96, per cent variance = 39). These items, in the same format, were: "Parents ought to help their children with college expenses," "Parents ought to providefinancialhelp to their adult children when the children are having financial difficulty," "Children ought to let aging parents live with them when the parents can no longer live by themselves," "Children ought to provide financial help to aging parents when their parents are havingfinancial difficulty," and "Parents ought to let their adult children live with them when the children are having problems."
Finally, three Likert-type items were used to measure gender equality. The items were: "Parents should encourage just as much independence in their daughters as in their sons," "In a successful marriage, the partners must have freedom to do what they want individually," and "If a husband and wife both work full-time, they should share household tasks equally." The eigenvalue was 1.49; the factor accounted for 50 per cent of the variance in the items.
RESULTS
The percentage of respondents who are childless for each category of the independent variables is presented in Table 1. Also, results from the multivariate model are shown. Overall, only 3.5 per

cent of men and 2.8 per cent of women have never had children and say they do not want any. Pronatalism appears to be alive and well in American society. Nevertheless, childlessness does vary across subgroups of the population.
MULTIPLE CLASSIFICATIONANALYSIS
The MCA analysis shows a slight curvilinear effect for education for male respondents. The overall effect is not statistically significant, however. For females, education shows a direct linear trend with childlessness. The more educated females tend to have higher rates of childlessness. These differences are reduced, but not eliminated, once other characteristics are taken into account. Higher education may provide greater chances for socioeconomic success, but the demands for socioeconomic achievement may compete with family. Higher education may also be associated with less traditional value orientations. Despite this tendency, only a small minority of even the most educated women are childless by our definition.
Preliminary analysis (not shown) indicated that age and marital status have an interactive influence on childlessness. Age of the respondent is important for never-married respondents, but not for the married population. Thus, these two variables were combined. Married persons are unlikely to be childless, regardless of whether they are in their first marriage, between marriages, or in a subsequent marriage. The young nevermarried respondents are a little more likely to be childless than the married groups, and childlessness increases dramatically with age. About one out of five never-married people over age 35 are childless, and expect to remain so, even after all other variables are taken

into account. This is by far the highest percentage of childlessness observed in any subcategory of the population considered in this study. The results for the males and females were similar, though the rates of childlessness were slightly higher among the males than the females.
Although non-Hispanic whites are a little more likely to be childless, ethnic differences are relatively small and are not statistically significant.
Surprisingly, occupational differences in childlessness are relatively small. Professionals and managers of both genders are a little more likely to be childless, but the differences are neither large nor statistically significant. Control for other variables also reduces the magnitude of occupational differences. This was true for both males and females. These results are somewhat surprising since most studies have characterized both the male and female childless as an occupational elite (see the summary review by Houseknecht, 1987, p. 381).
People who prefer to work a great deal (more than 40 hours per week) and those who prefer not to work at all are the most likely to be childless. A strong commitment to career appears to be incompatible with family life for some people. This effect is stronger for women than men. Why those who do not want to work have higher rates of childlessness is not clear. Both work preference and childlessness could result from disability, depression, an unusual response pattern in the survey, or some other factor. One possible pattern may be that these are among the poorly educated who also had slightly (though not statistically significant) levels of childlessness.
In combination, the differences for occupation, education, and preferred

hours of work indicate that greater human capital and a stronger career orientation may compete with family formation for some people, but the relatively low rates of childlessness in all categories suggest that only a small minority see work and family as mutually incompatible roles.
Those with no religious preference are more likely to be childless, but denominational differences are not very large, and overall this variable is not significantly related to childlessness. Frequency of church attendance has a stronger relationship with childlessness than denominational affiliation. Those who never go to church are more likely to be childless, and the beta coefficient remains statistically significant once other variables are included. Caution must be used in attributing cause and effect, however, because many people may attend church for the benefit of the children they already have.
Reasons people give as important considerations in the decision to have a child are also correlated with childlessness for both males and females. This variable actually increases in importance after other factors are controlled. This relationship demonstrates the intuitive notion that people who do not have or want children have several reasons for their decisions. The not-ascertained category is included here because many respondents were not asked the reasons questions, but we wanted to keep these respondents in the analysis. Results for the not-ascertained are a consequence of the types of people who were not asked the questions and are substantively uninteresting.
Because attitudinal variables approximate continuous variables rather than categorical ones, they are entered as covariates in the MCA. The factorscores are standardized such that the re-

gression coefficient can be interpreted as the expected increase in the per cent childless given a change of one standard deviation in the independent variable. For example, men who are one standard deviation below the mean on traditional family values would have a rate of childlessness 5.2 percentage points lower than men who are one standard deviation above the mean (2 x 2.606).
Correlations of factor-score variables are generally in the expected direction. Those who are less in favor of gender equality, who believe in traditional family values, who oppose sexual liberalism,who believe in stronger norms of intergenerational support, and religious fundamentalists are less likely to be childless. But, with the exception of the bivariate relationship for men, those who are opposed to mothers working also have a slight tendency toward childlessness. Only the coefficients for traditional family values and extended family support are in the predicted direction and statistically significant for both men and women, however.
In combination, these variables explain 9.1 per cent of the variation in childlessness for men, and 7.5 per cent for women. These low values are partially due to the low overall variation in childlessness. In other words, because most people want or already have children, it is not easy to account for variation in this variable. The low explained variance also points to violation of statistical assumptions when the dependent variable is dichotomous and suggests that other statistical approaches should be considered.
LOG-LINEAR MODELS
In order to avoid the violation of statistical assumptions created by dichotomous dependent variables, we also conducted a log-linear analysis. Log-linear

analysis is limited, however. A large number of categories and/or a large number of variables results in extremely large tables with no cases in several cells. To minimize this problem, variables which were not found to be statistically significant in the MCA were excluded, and categories of other variables were collapsed to show only the largest differences. Various models were estimated to evaluate the possibility of interaction effects. A logit model was estimated with childlessness as the dependent variable. Only interactions statistically significant at the 0.01 level were retained. The final model has a likelihood ratio X2 value of 531.02 with 866 degrees of freedom and a probability level of 1.00, which indicates that the model provides a good fit of expectedto-observed frequencies of childlessness. Coefficients for this model are reported in Tables 2 and 3.
Sex or gender of the respondents did not have a large or statistically significant (at the 0.05 level) effect in the analysis, and so this variable was excluded. In other words, once other characteristics are taken into account, gender differences in childlessness are minimal.
Coefficients in Table 2 show the multiplicative effect of each category of the independent variable on the odds of being childless. For example, respondents with less than a college degree are 0.766 times less likely than average to be childless, and those with sixteen or more years of schooling are 1.306 times more likely to be childless. It is often easier to interpret the effect on the relative odds of being childless, so the second column reports effects on the relative odds. For example, those with sixteen or more years of schooling are 1.7 times more likely to be childless than those with less education, even though the rates of

childlessness among both groups are low.
Patterns observed in Table 2 parallel those obtained from the MCA. Those who have never married are about 6.7 times more likely to be childless than the ever-married population. Those who never attend church are over twice as likely as church attenders to be childless. Childlessness is also high for those over 35, for those who prefer no work or long work weeks, for those with antinatalist attitudes about having children,

and for those who disagree with traditional family values and norms of intergenerational support. Of these, marital status shows the greatest effect, followed by the traditional and extended family scales. Effects of other variables are in the 2.0 range.
Interaction effects are reported in Table 3. The first set of interactions indicates that the effect of preferred hours of work is greater among the nevermarried than among the married respondents. Evidently, some never-

married who cannot work or who are very committed to working see childbearing as problematic.
The second interaction indicates that the effect of the reasons variable is accentuated in the married population. Because interpretation of the "notascertained" category of the reasons variable is difficult to interpret substantively, coefficients for this category are not presented. Never-married people may give less thought to what should be considered before having children because childbearing is not assumed to be an integral part of their lifestyle. On the other hand, married persons who score on the antinatalist end of the reasons scale are much more inclined to be childless. They may also be rationalizing and justifying their deviation from the norm of having children which characterizes the majority of the married population.
The last two interactions indicate that the influence of the reasons variable is

contingent on traditional family values and belief in intergenerational support. Respondents who believe in traditional family norms and extended family support have a strong normative framework for childbearing such that stated reasons for childbearing have little impact on childlessness. Those who are moderate or low on the measure of traditional values and extended family support lack normative pressures, and so their personal preferences play a greater role in childbearing. In other words,values supporting traditional families and intergenerational support seem to supersede more personal reasons for having or not having children.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
We defined and operationalized voluntary childlessness as not having children and expecting not to have any. By this definition, only a small proportion

of the total population is childless: 3.5 per cent of the men and 2.8 per cent of the women. The combined variable of age and marital status was clearly associated more closely with childlessness than any of the other variables included in the analysis. The second strongest correlate of childlessness was a variable we called reasons or motives for having children. In general, those with an antinatalist set of reasons were more likely to be childless. We found some significant interactions and variations from this general pattern, however. Personal reasons for having children had a greater influence among the married and those with less traditional beliefs about family values and extended families.
In addition to these variables, hours of work desired and church attendance were related to childlessness. Education was related for women, but not for men. Positive attitudes toward traditional families and toward extended family support were also related as we would have expected.
Occupation, surprisingly, was not related to childlessness for either men or women. Race, religious denomination, support for gender equality, support for women working, and religious fundamentalism were not.
Race and religious denomination have been found by a number of previous authors to be related to childlessness. This may be changing, however. Studies utilizing recent data have found no differences on these two variables (Jacobson et al., 1988). Pronatalist norms for having children are pervasive across racial and denominational groups. However, religious involve-

ment is still negatively associated with childlessness.
Houseknecht has emphasized the necessity to examine childlessness separately for men and for women. Surprisingly, we found very little difference, by sex, in the predicting value of the variables in our analysis. Moreover, gender was not significant in our analysis, once other attributes were taken into account. In general, the same variables that showed differences for women, also showed significant differences for men, and those that did not predict for men did not predict for women.
The main conclusion to be drawn from the present study is that the norm in American society is still to have children. Moreover, the frequency of being childlessness in the United States is probably not increasing dramatically. Most people, both males and females expect and desire to have children. Our conclusion is in agreement with Houseknecht (1987, p. 375) when she states: "the long-term (her emphasis) trend in the voluntary childless rate appears to be downward, or at least not upward." These statements may seem to contradict the common notion that childlessness is increasing, but the data clearly show that rates of childlessness are low. The rates of childlessness, even in the highest subgroups rarely exceed 10 per cent. The only exception is for men and women who have never married and are over age 35. Even then, the strength of pronatalism is revealed. Even though marriage prospects are diminishing and biological clocks are running out of time, about 80 per cent of this group either have or still want to have children.
