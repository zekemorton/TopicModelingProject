ABSTRACT: It is widely assumed that employment and breastfeeding are relatively incompatible behaviors in the United States; yet recently both the incidence of breastfeeding and the incidence of postpartum employment increased. This paper examines the relationship between these trends from 1968-86 using data from the National Surveys of Family Growth. I find that these trends result from increases in the likelihood that a woman engages in both breastfeeding and postpartum employment. There has been an increase over time in the incidence and duration of women concurrently breastfeeding and working. However, the majority of employed women did not concurrently breastfeed, suggesting that conflicts between these behaviors still exist.

One of the major social changes in the United States during the last three decades has been the growing number of mothers with children participating in the labor market. This changing pattern of labor force participation has included mothers of even the youngest children; currently more than half of women with children under one year of age are in the labor market (O'Connell, 1990). During much of this same period, American women also increased their rates of breastfeeding. While less than 30 per cent of women breastfed their infants during the 1960's, by the period 1983-86, 56 per cent of women initiated breastfeeding (Duberstein, 1993).
These concurrent increases in the incidence of breastfeeding and the incidence of postpartum employment are puzzling in light of the belief that these are relatively incompatible behaviors. Studies have observed a negative relationship between the duration of breastfeeding and maternal employ-

ment, with long durations of breastfeeding associated with a later entry to postpartum employment and fewer hours of employment (Kurinji et al., 1989; Lindberg, 1996; Ryan and Martinez, 1989). Proponents of breastfeeding have expressed concern that the increases in postpartum employment might have negative health consequences through decreased breastfeeding (Barber-Madden, 1990; DHHS, 1984; La Leche League, 1981), and there has been a growth of programs aimed at promoting breastfeeding among employed women (see Spisak and Gross, 1991, for examples).
The analysis of population trends risks falling prey to ecological fallacies in which incorrect conclusions are drawn about individuals based solely on the observation of population data (Babbie, 1989). It is dangerous to assume that the independent trends in breastfeeding and postpartum employment derive from increases in the likelihood that an individual woman both

breastfeeds and works during the postpartum period. For example, during the 1980's about 50 per cent of all mothers breastfed and about 50 per cent worked during the postpartum period. It is possible, for example, that not a single woman could engage in both of these behaviors, yet the two observed rates could coexist. While this is an extreme example, it makes evident that the trends in breastfeeding and postpartum employment could result from women engaging in one of the behaviors exclusive of engagement in the other.
I use data from the National Surveys of Family Growth to explore the association between these two trends during the period 1968-86. Using data from the four waves of the National Surveys of Family Growth, I first calculate trends in these behaviors from 1968-86. Second, I determine to what extent the trends represent changes in the likelihood that an individual woman engages in both breastfeeding and postpartum employment. Finally, I examine the relative timing of the behaviors to consider ways that women may choose to balance the demands of each. Together these analyses all try to reconcile the trends in each behavior in light of their potential incompatibility.
By focusing on the relationship between the aggregate trends, this work provides needed information not otherwise available for designing public policy. With a paucity of empirical evidence concerning the relationship between women's employment and breastfeeding behaviors in the United States, former Surgeon General Koop noted that the "data necessary to direct effective promotional efforts to working women and to those whose influ-

ence them are not available (DHHS, 1989)." This project will provide data relevant to national health goals to increase the incidence and duration of breastfeeding in the U.S.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
These analyses use data from the National Surveys of Family Growth (NSFG) Waves I-IV. Conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics in 1973, 1976, 1982, and 1988, these cross-sectional surveys interviewed a nationally representative random stratified sample of women ages 15 to 44.l Details of the sampling and data collection procedures for the four waves can be found elsewhere (NCHS, 1978, 1981, 1985a, 19856). The analyses reported here use post-stratified sampling weights that also correct for non-response. Each NSFG wave collected comparable information on both women's infant feeding and postpartum employment behaviors, making them well-suited to these analyses.
1While Waves III and IV included all women regardless of marital history, Waves I and II of the NSFG were limited to ever-married women or those with their own child living in the household. Not collecting information from never-married women without their own child in the household at the time of the survey may produce biases by excluding a highly selective population of women who may have given up their children to adoption or fosterage (see Geronimus and Korenman, 1993; Burton, 1990). Exploratory analyses suggest that the magnitude of this bias is extremely small. In Wave III and Wave IV, approximately 2 per cent of never-married women with their most recent birth occurring in the last five years did not reside with their child at the time of the survey. If the magnitude of this pattern was similar in the periods covered in Wave I and II, then few potentially eligible women would be excluded from Waves I and II because of nonresidential children.

SAMPLE AND VARIABLES
The NSFG collected information on breastfeeding incidence and duration for each birth. Women were asked "When (child) was an infant, did you breastfeed (her/him) at all?" If they answered affirmatively, they were also asked "How many weeks old was (s/he) when you stopped breastfeeding (her/him) altogether?" In these analyses, breastfeeding duration is measured in months to permit comparisons to the timing of employment; any woman reporting that she initiated breastfeeding, but breastfed less than one month is coded as breastfeeding for one month. Women whose youngest child wasnot living with them at the age of two months were also excluded, reducing any confounding effects ofinfant mortality and adoption.
A woman at work within one year of the delivery is coded as participating in postpartum employment. The usual definition of labor force participation includes individuals at work, those who have a job but are not currently at work (e.g., vacation), and those looking for a job. The NSFG collects information only about this first aspect-- when the woman wasat work following a birth. This distinction is important since a significant proportion of the women employed postpartum are not actually at work (Klerman and Leibowitz, 1993).
Data constraints required focusing on experiences surrounding eachwoman's most recent birth, since information on the timing of employment after childbirth was collected only in reference to this birth. I also restrict the sample to women who had their most recent birth at least one and no more

than five years prior to the survey. This removes theproblem of right censoring in the measurement of postpartum employment, since at least 12 months have elapsed since birth for each woman, as well as reducing the risk of reporting errors associated with retrospective information (Groves, 1989; Haaga, 1988).2 To examine trends, I define samples from each NSFG wave that do not include overlapping years. Each waves thus serves as a distinct period, spanning from 1968-86. Table 1 summarizes the data used from each NSFG wave.
ANALYTICAL MEASURES
I define four aggregate measures of breastfeeding and postpartum employment behaviors. First, a woman engages in exclusive behaviors if she engages in one but not the other during the postpartum period. In contrast, a woman engages in dual behaviors ifshe engages in both behaviors during the first year following a birth, without any necessary overlap in the timing of the behaviors. The dual behaviors can be further divided to describe the relative timing of a woman's breastfeeding and postpartum employment. Sequential behaviors indicate that a woman both breastfeeds and works postpartum, but sequences these behaviors by stopping breastfeeding before making
2An alternate approach is to use current-status data, which creates synthetic cohorts of women based upon behaviors at the time of the survey(see John et al., 1988). While this method is common in research in LDC settings, it is not often used for U.S. data. With lowfertility and short breastfeeding durations, the number of women observed breastfeeding at the time of the survey likely is too small for robust estimates.

the transition into employment.3 Concurrent behaviors refer to a woman breastfeeding and working simultaneously during at least some of the postpartum period.4
The incidence of sequential and concurrent behaviors are measured with some error depending upon when in the month the behaviors occurred. Although the relative timing of the behaviors is measured in months, a single month can indicate an interval from one day to eight weeks.5 To incorporate this variability, an alternate and broader liberal definition of concurrent behaviors is created which includes women who enter employment within
3Incidence of Sequential Behaviors = [# women (breastfeeding duration < I) and (enter employment > = I) / # women giving birth] * 100, where I < = 12 months postpartum.
4Incidence of Concurrent Behaviors = [# women (breastfeeding duration = I) and (enter employment < I) / # women giving birth] * 100, where I < = 12 months postpartum. This definition of concurrent behaviors may exclude a small number of women who breastfeed and work concurrently, but do not initiate this pattern until after 12 months postpartum (for example if a woman breastfed for 18 months and entered employment in month 14).
5A woman starting employment on June 30 and stopping breastfeeding on July 1and is coded ashaving one month of concurrent behavior, although the actual time elapsed is only one day. Yet a woman starting employment on June 1 and stopping breastfeeding on July 31 is also coded as having a one month interval between behaviors, while the actual time elapsed is eight weeks.

one month before or after they stop breastfeeding. In the following sections, I use these analytical measures to examine the relationship between the trends in breastfeeding and postpartum employment from 1968-86.
RESULTS
INDEPENDENT TRENDS
To my knowledge, no study has examined trends in breastfeeding and trends in postpartum employment with the same data set and methods. I use the four waves of the NSFG to consider whether some trends reported elsewhere may be measurement artifacts. The NSFG corroborates other reports of increases during the last two decades in both the incidence of breastfeeding (Ryan et al., 1991a) and the incidence of postpartum employment (O'Connell, 1990), as shown in Figure 1. The incidence of postpartum employment rose from about 30 per cent of women in 1968-72, to slightly more than half of eligible women by 1983-86. The trend in the incidence of breastfeeding followed a similar pattern. Figures 2 and 3 show that the timing of the two behaviors also changed, as generally women stopped breastfeeding later in the postpartum period, while they entered work earlier from 1968 to 1986.

INCIDENCE OF DUAL BEHAVIORS
Table 2 presents the distribution of women's breastfeeding and postpartum employment behaviors from 1968-86. The per cent of women engaging in both breastfeeding and postpartum employment increased more than fourfold over the twenty-year period, rising from 6.5 per cent to 29.4 per cent of all women. During this same period, the per cent of women engaging in neither of these behaviors almost halved, falling from 54.8 to 23.3 per cent of all women. Modest increases are observed in the per cent of women engaging in only breastfeeding, while there is no significant change in the per cent of women engaging only in postpartum employment during the 20 years under study.
Table 2 provides further information about the women engaging in both

breastfeeding and postpartum employment, by focusing on the relative timing of these behaviors. As discussed in the methods section, two sets of measures are estimated based on a conservative and a liberal definition of concurrence. Chi-square tests for differences between periods are also presented. Based on the conservative definition, less than 2 per cent of women breastfed and worked concurrently in either of the first two time periods. By the 1983-86 period, the incidence of concurrent behaviors (by the conservative definition) had increased sharply to 11.9 per cent of all women. Sequential behaviors also became consistently more common, and from 1968-86 their incidence increased significantly from 5.1 per cent to 17.5per cent of women.
Results from the liberal definition show a different pattern. In 1983-86, this broader definition of concurrent

behaviors includes 22.6 per cent of women, twice the per cent of women engaging in concurrent behaviors under the conservative definition. Since the per cent of women engaging in both breastfeeding and postpartum employment stays constant between these two definitions, the more liberal measure only shifts women from a pattern of sequential to concurrent behaviors. Specifically, it includes in concurrent behaviors women stopping breastfeeding within one month before entering employment. Comparing the two sets of definitions I can conclude that more than 10per cent of women overall stop breastfeeding in the month before entering employment.

RELATIVE INCIDENCE OF DUAL
BEHAVIORS
I next measure the relative incidence of exclusive, dual, concurrent, and sequential behaviors among those women engaging in either breastfeeding (Figure 4) or postpartum employment (Figure 5). In these measures, the numerator is the same as in the measures for all women; only the denominator changes to reflect the new population at risk. In Figure 4, the height of each bar indicates the total per cent of women engaging in breastfeeding in the period. Each column is divided into exclusive, sequential, and concurrent, using the conservative def-

inition of concurrent behaviors. While the height of each bar in the column indicates the absolute incidence level of the specific behavior among all women (previously reported in Table 2), the number within the bar indicates the relative incidence among those women initiating breastfeeding. Together the concurrent and sequential behaviors total the incidence of dual behaviors.
For example, in 1968-71, 6.3 per cent of women who breastfed also worked concurrently, while 22.7 per cent breastfed and worked sequentially. When summed, this indicates that the relative incidence of dual behaviors among breastfeeding women was 29 per cent; the absolute incidence

of dual behaviors was 6.5 per cent (as measured against the _y-axis). In contrast, by 1983-86 the relative and absolute incidence of dual behaviors rose to about 53 and 29 per cent respectively. Over time, the relative incidence of exclusive behaviors declined sharply, from about 71 to 47 per cent of all breastfeeding women, while the absolute incidence increased. Thus, by 1983-86, more than half of women initiating breastfeeding also worked sometime during the postpartum period and more than one in five did so concurrently.
Figure 5 presents a similar pattern of change among women engaging in postpartum employment. In 1983-96, about 60 per cent of women who

spent in concurrent behaviors, among all women engaging in these behaviors. These measures are based on the conservative definition of concurrent behaviors. In 1977-80, half of those women engaging in concurrent behaviors did so for only 1-3 months. By 1983-86, this figure had fallen to only 40 per cent, while more women engaged in concurrent behaviors for 4-6 months than during the previous period. A chi-square test indicates that overall the periods are significantly different at the 0.05 level. Not only did more women engage in concurrent behaviors over time, but they seem to have done so for longer durations.
Additional analyses (not shown) calculated the distribution for months spent in concurrent behaviors based on the more liberal definition of this behavior. Including women who stopped breastfeeding within one month of entering employment sharply increases the per cent of women engaging in concurrent behaviors for very short durations.
DISCUSSION
In this paper, I have examined the relationship between breastfeeding and postpartum employment, as well as changes in this relationship over time. By systematically relating these two behaviors through comparable measures, I find that the increases in the overall rate of breastfeeding and the overall rate of postpartum employment represent, in part, increases in the likelihood that a woman engages in both behaviors during the postpartum period. From 1968-86 there is an increase in the percentage of women who engaged in both of these behaviors

during the first twelve months postpartum, rising from 6 per cent to 25 per cent of all women.
While many women are both breastfeeding and working, the majority of these are choosing to do so at different times during the postpartum period. However, from 1968-86 there is a growing population of women concurrently engaging in breastfeeding and employment. Many of these women appear to have overlap in the timing of these behaviors only in the months surrounding their transition to postpartum employment. Previous research shows that women are most likely to stop breastfeeding in the month that they enter employment (Lindberg, 1996). Thus most women engage in concurrent behaviors for a short period of time, although there is evidence of increasing durations.
The increases in the proportion of women engaging in both behaviors concurrently and the increases in the duration of concurrent behaviors suggests that women were better able to combine work and breastfeeding over the 1968-86 period. However, the majority of employed women did not concurrently breastfeed, suggesting that conflicts between breastfeeding and employment likely still exist. Surveys of employers during this period found little evidence of accommodation to breastfeeding women; there was limited provision of space for breast pumping for refrigeration of mothers' milk, and limited access to breastfeeding breaks that would make concurrent breastfeeding and employment more convenient (MacLaughlin and Strelnick, 1984; Moore and Jansa, 1987). Given the apparent lack of supportive work environments, the increases in
