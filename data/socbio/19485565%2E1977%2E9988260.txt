ABSTRACT: The authors criticize past studies for concluding that the relationship between socioeconomic status and infant mortality has declined in modern industrial societies to the degree that it is almost nonexistent. Such studies computed infant death rates utilizing small numbers of births and deaths, resulting in unreliable rates. In this study, social area analysis is employed in a fairly large city with vital data from the early 1970's. The findings indicate a rather strong relationship still exists between SES and infant mortality. Limitations of social area analysis are discussed, and suggestions for future research are given.

The infant mortality rate in the United States has declined steadily from 99.9 per 1,000 live births in 1915 to an estimated rate of 16.1 in 1975 (Bogue, 1959, Tables 9-17; U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1976, Table 6). Conflicting evidence exists, however, regarding the degree to which this reduction has characterized all socioeconomic groups and the degree to which an inverse association between socioeconomic status and infant mortality still holds in modern industrial societies such as the United States. While some recent evidence still supports the existence of a strong inverse association (Brooks, 1975a, 19756, U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, 1972, 1975; Shapiro et al., 1968), some studies have argued that the relationship has been steadily declining to the degree that it is virtually nonexistent.
The principal argument offered in support of a declining association between socioeconomic status (SES) and infant mortality has been centered around the rapidity of the decline in infant mortality

in the twentieth century and the accompanying shift that has taken place in the relative importance of the neonatal and postneonatal components of infant mortality. While, for example, neonatal deaths (infant deaths occurring during the first 27 days of life) represented about 44 per cent of all infant deaths in 1915, in 1971 they represented about 74 per cent. In other words, the proportion of postneonatal deaths (deaths occurring at the ages of 28 days to 364 days) has dropped from 56 per cent to only 26 per cent during this period (Brooks, 1975a, p. 291). As the argument goes, one would expect a decline in the inverse association between SES and total infant mortality since the association has historically worked primarily through postneonatal mortality (Donabedian et al., 1965, p. 1084). Stockwell (1962, p. 108) notes that deaths occurring during the neonatal period are primarily caused by biological rather than socioeconomic factors, while postneonatal deaths are more sensitive to socioeconomic differentials since they are removed from

the "physiological processes of gestation and birth." Since the postneonatal rate is such a small part of the total infant rate and most deaths are therefore related to biological rather than socioeconomic factors, it would not be surprising to find a rather weak (or nonexistent) association between SES and total infant mortality in a modern industrial society such as the United States (Stockwell, 1962, p. 111).

areas, thus rendering their calculated infant mortality rates quite unstable, especially when broken into their neonatal and postneonatal components. We believe that this method can be useful only if employed in rather large cities where the tract groupings by SES provide a large enough number of live births (and infant deaths) for the calculation of meaningful infant death rates.

There have been primarily two important studies offering the above argument to explain their findings of a weak association between total infant mortality and SES. Both studies employed social area analysis with data on census tracts in middle-sized Northeastern cities. Willie (1959) analyzed infant mortality data for the years 1950-56 on 59 tracts in Syracuse, New York; Stockwell (1962) examined, in a similar manner, data for the years 1949-51 on 36 tracts in Providence, Rhode Island. Both studies employed socioeconomic measures on census tracts from the 1950 census of population.
In a recent study, Brooks (1975ft, p. 292) has criticized both Willie and Stockwell for concluding that the histori-

We would also like to emphasize that the utility of social area analysis is still limited even when used with data from large cities. First, it always entails the risk of an "ecological fallacy"; second, it does not permit multivariate analysis of infant mortality rates. If a variable in addition to SES is introduced, for example, the subsequent calculation of rates becomes less stable since they are measured with fewer deaths and births. This is a serious limitation given the development and refinement of multivariate techniques during the last two decades. In other words, infant mortality differentials can be better investigated employing such multivariate techniques as multiple regression and path analysis.

find even weaker associations between SES and infant mortality in the 197O's. Our findings are presented below after a brief description of our data and methods.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
After excluding census tracts not primarily in the city of San Antonio, we analyzed data on 115 tracts which include almost all of San Antonio's population. In a somewhat similar manner to that of Willie and Stockwell, we ranked the census tracts according to three socioeconomic variables using a modified version of an index supplied by Shevky and Bell (19SS).
The three variables we chose from the 1970 census are: median family income, median number of years of school completed by persons 25 years old and over, and the percentage of persons 16 years old and over who were professionals, technicians, and kindred workers, managers and administrators (except farm), and sales, clerical, and kindred workers. Pearson's zero order correlations between the three variables indicate that they are highly intercorrelated: for income-education, r = 0.76; for income-occupation, r = 0.82; and for education-occupation, r = 0.89. While data on other indicators of SES are published, we felt that an index capturing income, education, and occupation is conceptually more meaningful.
The 115 census tracts were ranked on each variable according to the formula Xv - Lv I Hv - Lv x 100, where Xv is the census tract value of each of the three SES variables, and Hv and Lv are the highest and lowest value of each variable among all 115 tracts. The resulting three scores for each census tract were subsequently added and divided by three in order to yield a composite score of census tract SES. This method of ranking census tracts assigns equal weight to each of the three SES variables. The scores yielded by the

index may range from 0 to 100. The 115 tracts were then divided into four socioeconomic groupings: High (scores 75-100), Medium-high (scores 50-74), Medium-low (scores 25-49), and Low (scores 0-24). With this division, 21 tracts fall in the High group, 30 in the Medium-high, 44 in the Medium-low, and 20 in the Low group.
Data on infant deaths and live births by census tract were obtained from the usual official sources for the years 1970-74. We felt that using a five-year period would make our calculated infant death rates more stable. After adding all live births and all infant deaths for each of the four SES groups, we calculated, in the usual manner, three measures of infant mortality for each group: total infant mortality rate (deaths at ages 0-364 days/number of live births X 1,000), neonatal infant mortality rate (deaths at ages 0-27 days/live births X 1,000), and postneonatal infant mortality rate (deaths at ages 28-364 days/live births X 1,000). The results are presented below.
RESULTS
The three calculated infant mortality rates for each of the four SES groups of census tracts are presented in Table 1. In addition to the calculated rates, Table 1 presents the number of deaths along with the number of live births during the fiveyear period by SES group. The data show a definite relationship between the total infant mortality rate and SES. The rate rises steadily from a low of 13.8 for the High SES group to about 20.8 for the Low SES group. While the relationship between neonatal mortality and SES is not as strong, it still exists. The strongest relationship is found between SES and postneonatal mortality; the postneonatal rate rises from 2.3 to 6.3 as SES decreases. This stronger relationship between postneonatal mortality and SES gives support

about two decades later would not have been expected if Willie's and Stockwell's conclusions had been correct. Our findings, of course, refer to one city. But other studies, such as Brooks' two recent papers using states and counties as units of observation, have found strong relationships between socioeconomic differentials and infant mortality.
A further comment regarding our analysis is required. San Antonio is a city with a very large minority of Mexican Americans. We computed the proportion of persons of Spanish surname or language for the four SES groups. As expected, this proportion rises from 16.9 per cent in the High SES group, to 37.7 per cent in the Medium-high, 60.0 per cent in the Medium-low, and 92.9 per cent in the Low SES group. The question arises of whether Mexican Americans experience higher infant death rates than Anglos regardless of their SES. We computed separate total infant death rates for the period 1970-72 for persons of Spanish surname and for Anglos in San Antonio, which are 19.0 and 17.4 respectively. This relatively small difference leads us to suspect that Mexican Americans, unlike Blacks, do not experience higher rates of infant loss when SES is controlled. The difference in the rates can be attributed to their lower SES as the previously mentioned relationship between the percentage of persons of Spanish surname or language and SES of census tract groups indicates.
While we believe that there is no inde-

pendent effect of ethnicity on infant mortality in San Antonio, one should introduce ethnicity as a variable before this fact can be clearly established. This point brings us to one of the serious limitations of social area analysis of infant mortality. The introduction of another variable, such as the percentage of Mexican Americans, would require calculation of rates with much smaller numbers of births and deaths, thus rendering those rates much less stable. While this limitation of social area analysis does not seem to influence the relationship between SES and infant mortality in San Antonio, it could pose a serious problem for studies in other cities with a large proportion of Blacks. The possible contaminating effect of this variable was not examined by Stockwell (1962) and Willie (1959) in Providence and Syracuse.
We hope to have demonstrated that social area analysis of infant mortality is rather weak methodologically. While it can have some utility in some cases, its serious problems limit its utility in most urban areas. Infant mortality differentials can better be studied from a multivariate and multistage perspective following Brooks'examples (Brooks, 1975a, 1975¿>).
