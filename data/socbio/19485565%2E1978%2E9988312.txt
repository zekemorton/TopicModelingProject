ABSTRACT: Studies of adult same-sex twins which rely upon volunteer subjects typically consistof about two-thirds female and two-thirds monozygotic (MZ) pairs. Because of this recruitment bias, the male and dizygotic (DZ) twins in such studies will be less representative of their respective populations and will show smaller between-pair variance on many traits than will the comparison samples of female and MZ twins. This reduction in between-pair variance results in underestimation of the true intraclass correlation in the populations of DZ twins and in overestimation ofthe true heritability of the trait under study. The only adequate solution to this problem may be to provide sufficient extrinsic incentive (e.g., money payments) to overcome the strong recruitment bias documented in this paper.

* These volunteers tend to be two-thirds female and about two-thirds male. This disproportion is diminished by monetary incentive, insistent recruiting, minimal task demand, or by recruiting from a selected population of bright educated twins,
t D. Lykken and A. Tellegen, unpublished data, Psychiatry Department, University of Minnesota, 1974-77.

If twice as many MZ as compared with DZ twins volunteer, given the same extrinsic incentive, then we must conclude that the intrinsic incentive is less or the resistance greater for the DZ than for the MZ twin populations. Therefore, the important consequence of the two-thirds rule is that, even with selective recruiting (i.e., varying extrinsic incentive as needed), the male and DZ pairs must be expected to be less representative of their respective populations than are the female and MZ pairs representative of theirs.

Loehlin and Nichols (1976) have pointed out that large samples, at least four hundred pairs of each zygosity type, are required for even rough comparisons of heritability estimates in the mid range. The rule of two-thirds indicates not only that recruitment of DZ twins will be espedaily difficult but that, even with sufficient samples, interpretation of twin data based on self-selected volunteer subjects may still be seriously complicated by recruitment bias,

As Rosenthal and Rosnow (197S) have documented, females are more likely than males to volunteer as experimental subjects unless the research promises to be stressful. No explanation for this sex difference seems to be available. Volunteers also tend to be more intelligent, better educated, and to have higher social class status than nonvolunteers. The interests and values which conduce toward taking tests and other activities of research participation are more common among women than men and more frequent among intelligent, middle-class, bettereducated persons.

To compensate for greater task demand, incentive was increased by telephone follow-up and by monetary reward; as a result, the proportion of male pairs and of DZ pairs were both increased as shown in Table 1, No. 6 (Lykken and Tellegen, unpublished data). Extrinsic incentive can be said to be at a minimum when subjects volunteer without solicitation.

The foregoing considerations suggest, in consequence of the rule of two-thirds, that in volunteer twin samples MZ pairs, particularly MZ females, should be more representative of their respective populations,

than DZ pairs. Therefore, DZ pairs, especially DZ males, should show less total variability than do MZ pairs (or than do random pairs of unrelated subjects) on any traits possibly related to the tendency to volunteer as research subjects. We have administered Tellegen's Differential Personality Questionnaire (DPQ) to 337 same-sex twin-pair volunteers, including 152 MZ female, 72 DZ female, 79 MZ male, and 34 DZ male pairs. The DPQ consists of 300 items yielding scores on 11 relatively independent scales each of which has high internal consistency and high test-retest reliability in normal subjects (Tellegen, unpublished).
The DPQ scale means and total variances for our volunteer MZ and DZ groups are compared in Table 2. The DPQ Social closeness, Social potency and Impulsiveness scales represent three nearly orthogonal dimensions which are often subsumed under the conventional Extraversion concept. The Stress reaction scale measures the Neuroticism variable with high reliability but, at the same time, with considerable breadth of item content. Table 2 also contains data on five anthropometric variables, fingerprint ridge count, height, weight, ponderal index,2 and birth weight. Any trait that is related to the tendency to volunteer might show a difference between the MZ and DZ means. In the following paragraphs we will offer tentative interpretations of some of the differences found; but we emphasize that our present concern is to illustrate recruitment bias rather than to reach substantive conclusions about the particular variables studied here.
To begin with, DZ females score reliably higher on the Danger seeking scale than do the MZ females. But it would be a mistake to conclude that fraternal twins
2 The ponderal index, obtained by dividing height by the cube root of weight, is a measure of leaness.

therefore are more venturesome than identicals. All that these data show is that these DZ volunteers, who represent about 40 per cent of the DZ female pairs invited to participate, were more venturesome than the MZ volunteers, who represent about 80 per cent of those invited. Since we can assume that the MZ twins had more intrinsic interest in participating, it seems likely that the more timid of the DZ females were selectively omitted from our volunteer sample.
In regard to height, Wilson (1974) found no significant differences in height between four-year-old MZ and DZ pairs recruited in infancy (so that no recruitment bias in our sense could have been operating). If these trends persist into adulthood, then the fact that, for both sexes, our adult DZ volunteers are about one inch taller than the MZ twins may indicate a tendency for the shorter DZ twins to avoid participation.
One way to test these speculations, of course, would be to provide to all subjects a monetary incentive sufficient to outweigh the intrinsic incentive differential which favors MZ's over DZ's and females over males. We would then expect to find about equal means and variances for MZ's and DZ's on most of the variables listed in Table 2. We think the MZ females might still be higher on Social closeness, however, due not to an excess of high scores but to a paucity of low scores in the MZ sample. The total variance on Social closeness for the DZ females is equal to that for the norm group and significantly higher than the MZ total variance, which suggests that the DZ volunteers are not selected on this trait and that MZ females truly include fewer "loners" than are found among female DZ's or singletons.
Among males, MZ and especially DZ volunteers score significantly higher than the norm group on Social closeness, and the DZ variance is reliably less than that

for the MZ sample. Again we might conclude that having an MZ twin seems to preclude really low Social closeness scores. But it appears that for male DZ's a real sampling bias seems to operate with respect to this trait, with 81 per cent of our volunteers scoring above the norm group mean. This sample is the most selected of all, representing only about 20 per cent of all the DZ male pairs whose participation was solicited. With such weak intrinsic motivation it appears that either member of a male DZ pair having a "loner" disposition serves to exclude that pair from appearing in the sample.

in participation in a twin study, sufficiently so to overcome their shyness; and also, the fact that the co-twin will tend to be equally deviant in size may diminish self-consciousness. In respect to personality variables, it is the male DZ's who are most selected, their total variance being smaller than for MZ males for 10 of the 11 DPQ scales and significantly smaller for 4. Since it would be hard to see how fingerprint ridge count might influence the tendency to volunteer, it is reassuring to note that the DZ samples are not significantly more homogeneous on this variable than are the MZ groups.

The most striking feature of Table 2 is the tendency for the MZ and DZ volunteers to differ in total variance, often without a corresponding difference in mean score. Thus, the MZ and DZ females do not differ significantly in mean weight or in ponderal index, and yet the DZ variance is only about 60 per cent of the MZ total variance, a highly reliable difference. Inspection of the distributions shows that both extremes are missing from the DZ sample, that DZ pairs in which one or both members are either very heavy

The DZ correlations were 0.14 and 0.40 giving estimates of broad heritability of 1.16 (Raven) and 0.82 (Millhill). Had the DZ total variances equaled those found for the MZ volunteers, the DZ correlations would have increased from 0.14 to 0.42 and from 0.40 to 0.49.
