ABSTRACT:This paper utilizes data from the 1977-78 Kenya Fertility Survey, one component of the World Fertility Survey, to analyze the determinants of breastfeeding durations for women 15 to 50 years old who had their last-but-one live birth between 3 and 15 years prior to the interview. Comparisons are made with the findings from the World Fertility Surveys in eight other developing countries in Asia and Latin America. Findings indicate that literacy, urban residence, secondary school education, and modern employment reduce the duration of breastfeeding in Kenya. In addition, the subgroups of women who appear to be curtailing breastfeeding are growing in proportional size or are composed of women who may be innovators or leaders. A continuation of this pattern into the future may increase levels of infant morbidity and mortality and, in the absence of increased modern contraceptive practice, may increase the societal level of fertility.

The popularity of breastfeeding has been increasing in the United States and in many developed countries, a reversal of a trend away from breastfeeding which began during the 1930's, especially among upper- and middle-class women (Hendershot, 1981; Hirschman and Hendershot, 1979). On the other hand, recent evidence from the developing world suggests that the duration of breastfeeding may be declining among the more "modern" subgroups of women--those who are more educated, live in urban areas, and work in the modern sector (Kent, 1981;Akin et al., 1981; Romaniuk, 1980). Nutritionists and health officials view with alarm the possibility of an increase in bottle feeding in the developing world where infant formulas may be over-diluted or diluted with impure water by mothers unaware of basic nutrition and sanitation concepts. In addition to providing the necessary nutritional needs for infants, breast milk transmits certain valuable

antibodies from mother to child, an important factor in developing countries where health conditions are generally poor (Baer, 1981). Therefore, a curtailment of breastfeeding in a developing society might well result in poorer nutrition and in an increase in infant morbidity and mortality.
Development planners and demographers also view with alarm the prospect of a decrease in breastfeeding durations in the Third World because of the increase in the aggregate levels of fertility which might result. Medical research has demonstrated that the period of infertility after childbirth isprolonged biologically by the practice of breastfeeding (Tyson and Perez, 1978). A reduction in this period of lactational amenorrhea brought about by the reduction of the duration of breastfeeding has the potential for increasing the societal level of fertility considerably. This is particularly true in developing societies where modern contraceptive practice is un-

likely to be substituted for the natural fertility inhibiting effect of breastfeeding. In fact, Romaniuk (1980) has shown that the increase in fertility at the early stages of modernization documented in several African countries can be attributed in part to a decrease in breastfeeding durations.
A curtailment of breastfeeding durations in developing societies, therefore, has only negative implications. It would almost certainly result in poorer health and nutrition and in an increase in infant mortality. In addition, in the absence of widespread modern contraceptive practice, it would also result in an increase in the societal level of fertility. Whether the developing world will follow the pattern of the developed world--that is, whether breastfeeding will decline first and perhaps increase again at a later point--remains to be seen. Almost no reliable trend data exist for the developing world and little is known about the determinants of breastfeeding in developing societies.
This research will examine the determinants of breastfeeding duration in Kenya, a developing East African society, in order to identify whether certain subgroups of women appear to be curtailing breastfeeding, to infer future trends based on the behavior of subgroups which either appear to be growing in proportional size or are composed of innovators or leaders, and to suggest the implications of these inferred trends for Kenyan society. In addition, this study compares the breastfeeding patterns in Kenya with the patterns in eight other countries in Asia or Latin America. The countries used for comparison are Bangladesh, Indonesia, Jordan, and Sri Lanka in Asia, and Colombia, Guyana, Panama, and Peru in Latin America.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data for this study are taken from the Kenya Fertility Survey (KFS), one component of the World Fertility Survey Program. Throughout this paper the sample of Kenyan women is compared with similar samples of women in eight other countries which participated in the World Fertility Survey.1 A total of 8,100 women between the ages of 15 and 50 were interviewed in the KFS between August, 1977, and June, 1978. The data used here are restricted to the last but one live birth occurring to ever-married women. Thus, the sample of women is restricted to those who were evermarried and had had at least two births. In order to minimize the effects of truncation and recall biases, the universe of women under study was further restricted to include only those women who had had their last-but-one live birth between 3 and 15years preceding the interview. Such women comprise approximately 44 per cent of the women who had had a last-but-one live birth in Kenya (compared with a range of between 28 and 49 per cent for the eight other countries used for comparison).
RESULTS
In Kenya, as in the other eight countries, the results are affected by the biases associated with the retrospective nature of the data. Heaping of the reported durations of breastfeeding occurs in Kenya. In the absence of such

quate breastfeeding supplements and substitutes. Some confirmation for this thesis comes from the Rural Kenya Nutrition Survey conducted in 1977 which indicated that children who were breastfed late into their second year of life scored lower on a health index based on height, weight, and age than did children who had ceased to nurse by this time (Kenya Central Bureau of Statistics, 1979). There is not enough evidence, however, to establish the direction of causality. It is also possible that infants who were sickly from other causes were breastfed longer in the hopes of improving their health.
Though there is a pronounced preference for male children in Kenya, this preference does not lead to differential durations of breastfeeding by sex of child, as Table 1 shows. This also was the case in the eight other countries.
About 10 per cent of Kenyan women used contraception in the last closed interval (Table 1). They were the next to least likely to have done so. In the other countries the reported use of contraception during this interval ranged from 6 per cent in Bangladesh to 40 per cent in Panama. Kenyan women who were using efficient contraception during this interval breastfed for shorter durations than women using no contraception or women using inefficient methods. Previous research has shown, however, that efficient users of contraception in Kenya are a highly selected out-group of women who differ from the general population in many regards (Mott, 1981). It is not clear whether reported breastfeeding durations are actually related to the use of contraception or to the other unique characteristics of this group of women. Women in Kenya who do not use modern contraception may consciously breastfeed their children longer

in order to widen the intervals between their births; or, more likely, women who use modern contraception may breastfeed for shorter durations because they are more likely to be urban, be highly educated, and have modern occupations, factors which may also lead to shorter breastfeeding durations in the developing world.
In Kenya parity and age explain less than 1 per cent of the variation in durations of breastfeeding for both the total study sample and the subsample of women who did not use contraception during the interval as Table 2 shows. The direction and magnitude of the effects of age and parity on the duration of breastfeeding varied considerably in the eight other countries and were also able to explain little of the variation. They explained less than 1per cent in Indonesia and Sri Lanka and explained the most (almost 8 per cent) in Panama.
The effects of age and parity on the duration of breastfeeding are also measured in a Multiple Classification Analysis (Table 3) in which mother's education, place of residence, work status or work place since marriage, and husband's occupation are also controlled. Data are presented for both the total study sample and for the subsample of women who did not use contraception during the interval. Table 3 presents the departures from the mean duration of breastfeeding which are due to the various categories of the variables under study both controlled for the other variables in the analysis (adjusted deviations) and uncontrolled (unadjusted deviations). In Kenya, as in the other eight countries, the adjusted deviations from the grand means are small for each category of age and parity. The conclusion suggested is that breastfeeding is not used deliberately to limit family size.

In order to examine the effect of these country-specific variables in conjunction with the others in Kenya, a multiple regression model was run with duration of breastfeeding, measured continuously in months, as the dependent variable. In the model (Table 5) tribal membership is examined. Each major tribe is included as a dummy variable. A woman is coded one if she belongs to the particular tribe in question and zero if she belongs to another.

The other independent variables in the model include two continuous variables, mother's age at the beginning of the last closed interval, coded as the actual age, and parity, coded as the number of children born to the respondent, The remaining variables are dichotomous. Male child, Muslim religion, polygamous union, urban residence, being literate, having worked since marriage, and use of contraception during the interval were all coded one and in each

case the alternative was coded zero. In addition, two variables indicating the reason why a woman reported that she stopped breastfeeding were included. If a woman indicated that she stopped breastfeeding because the child died or because she became pregnant, she was coded one on the particular variable and in each case any other reason for curtailing breastfeeding was coded zero. Finally, the education variable was dichotomized into two separate dummy variables, a technique that has proved useful in previous research on Kenya (Mott, 1981and 1982). In the first variable, if a woman had attended primary school only she was coded one; all other alternatives were coded zero. In the second variable, if a woman had attended at least some secondary school, she was coded one; and if she had less than some secondary school education, she was coded zero.
The model suggests that the most "modern" subgroups of Kenya women breastfeed for shorter duration than do their more traditional counterparts. Secondary school attendance (though not just primary school attendance), literacy, urban residence, and having worked since marriage shorten the duration of breastfeeding. On the other hand, being Muslim, being in a polygamous union, and having attended only some primary school lengthen the duration of breastfeeding.
Membership in each ethnic group except the Kikuyu tribe and the Meru tribe significantly lengthens the duration of breastfeeding. Previous research utilizing this data set also found the Kikuyu and Meru to be unique in their higher propensity to use contraception (Mott, 1981).
Stopping breastfeeding because of the death of the child significantly

shortens the duration of breastfeeding, while stopping breastfeeding because of a subsequent pregnancy significantly lengthens the duration. The use of family planning during the interval has no impact on the duration of breastfeeding.
In order to test whether the variables measuring the reasons why a woman curtailed breastfeeding or the variable measuring her use of contraception during the interval greatly interact with the other sociodemographic variables, the model was also run with these three variables excluded. For the sake of economy this model has not been presented in this paper, but the results suggest that very little interaction occurs. The coefficients for the other sociodemographic variables are altered only slightly, and the patterns remain unchanged. In addition, there is no zero order correlation between any of these three variables and any other variable in the model greater than 0.14.
CONCLUSION
Several indexes of modernization suggest that Kenyan women are among the most traditional of the women studied here. Kenyan women are among the least likely to have attended secondary school, to have worked since marriage, and to have used modern contraception. In addition, a larger proportion of Kenyan women reside in rural areas than do any of the other women studied. In spite of this, Kenyan women fall midway between the other groups of women in their average duration of breastfeeding (13.5 months in a range that extends from 23.6 months to 8.3 months). Literacy, urban residence, secondary school education, and modern employment have a strong impact on the curtailment of breastfeeding in Kenya. In addition,
