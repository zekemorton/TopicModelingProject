ABSTRACT: Death rates vary over the life cycle in a standard fashion, with mortality probabilities being highest at infant and older ages. Nevertheless, when age curves of mortality are compared for different populations, they sometimes can be seen to intersect so that one population has higher death rates at younger and middle ages and lower rates at older ages. Past research has shown that this phenomenon is not due to erroneous data and is probably a result of some type of selection in survival patterns. A sample of pairs of mortality curves, 31 of which cross over and 31 of which do not, for combinations of countries and dates are analyzed to discover which causes of death are associated with the crossover phenomenon at the older ages. Cardiovascular and "other and unknown" diseases appear to contribute strongly to the crossover effect. Further research should deal with other comparisons and explore the underlying social and environmental factors.

The curve of age-specific death rates for a population tends to assume a standard form in which the death rate starts at a high peak immediately after birth, falls to a minimum in the early teens, and then rises systematically with age until the population has expired. Although populations with lower overall mortality generally have lower death rates at each age than populations with higher overall mortality, one can observe population comparisons in which curves of age-specific death rates intersect. This phenomenon of intersecting curves of mortality is usually referred to as the "mortality crossover" effect, and it has been the subject of some discussion in the research literature.
Research on the topic of mortality crossovers can be of considerable demographic significance for at least three reasons: (1) Crossovers imply different curves of agespecific mortality which need to be understood. (2) They probably represent the cumulative effect of one or more factors occurring over the whole life cycle but

which results in a crossover at a specific age. (3) To the extent that crossovers are explainable by some process of selection, variables producing the selection should be identified so that attention can be given to influencing them.
RELATED RESEARCH
For some time now, demographers have noted a peculiar tendency for age curves of mortality for some pairs of populations to "cross over" each other, usually at the older ages. Although this phenomenon has been reported for various populations at different past points in time, it has most frequently been described for comparisons of white and nonwhite populations in the United States (Spiegelman, 1967; Thornton and Nam, 1968).
For example, age-specific death rates in the United States in 1970 were higher for nonwhites than whites in every age category up through the age group 65-74. In the age group 75-84, however, the non-

It is not necessary, however, that populations having different death rates at the younger ages should have death rates at the older ages which are opposite in direction. In fact, one can find many pairs of populations for which mortality crossover does not occur. A most obvious example is

for 1959-61 before calculating specific death rates (Kitagawa and Hauser, 1973). Three sets of rates were determined, based on different assumptions. The conclusion reached was that the combined adjustments do not alter the finding that a reversal in death rates of whites and nonwhites occurs. That errors in the data at the older ages might account for the crossover is further suspect when we consider that the reversal may occur at younger ages in populations having highly reliable data (as in the case of Jews and non-Jews in Canada).

As a first step in testing some of these ideas, we undertook to measure the extent of the crossover phenomenon in cross-national perspective and then to explore the underlying cause-of-death structures. We obtained data on life expectancy at birth, age-specific death rates, cause-of-death patterns by age, and per capita income levels for females in 29 countries at several past dates (Preston et al., 1972; Preston, 1976). The total of 46 country-years represent those for which reasonably reliable data could be gathered. They do not constitute a representative sample of all possi-

MATERIALS AND METHODS

It was discovered that 649 out of the 1,035 pairs of curves did not cross at all at ages 60 and over (Table 1). On the other hand, 279 of them crossed once, and 107 crossed in two or more of our age categories. When we classified the populations by their per capita income level, we found that 168 of the 2 79 which crossed once did, in fact, constitute situations in which the population with the higherincome level had a relatively lower death rate at the earlier ages and a relatively higher death rate at the older ages. However, in 111 of the pairs which crossed once, the crossover occurred in the opposite direction, with the lower income population eventually attaining a higher death rate at the older ages. It was clear, therefore, that our original hypothesis was not an adequate representation of the selection phenomemon.

A sample of 31 country-year pairs was selected from the 279 pairs which crossed one time at ages 60 and over (see Table 2). These 31 included 21 in which the crossover was in the hypothesized direction and 10 in which the crossover occurred in the direction opposite to that predicted. Another sample of 31 country-year pairs was drawn from the 649 noncrossover pairs and matched with the 31 crossover pairs. Four criteria were selected for the matching. Ranked in terms of priority, they were: similarities in average life expectancy at birth, calendar year of mortality data, per capita income, and region of the world (differentiated according to Asia, Europe, Latin America, North America, and Oceania). (The values of the matched variables are given in Table 3.) The aim was to effect a reasonably close

SOUXCE: Preston et al., 1972, Appendix 4A. · Age-specific death rates in the lower-income countries were higher than those in the higher-income countries. For the crossover pairs, death rates in the lower-income countries were lower than those for the higher-income countries by age 85+. t Age-specific death rates in the lower-income countries were lower than those in the higher-income countries. For the crossover pairs, death rates in the lower-income countries were higher than those for the higher-income country by age 85 + .

Because the crossovers did not always occur in the predicted direction (in terms of the per capita income levels of the two populations), we separated the analysis into Sample A (those occurring in the hypothesized direction) and Sample B (those in which the lower-income population had a higher death rate after the crossover).
Table 4 examines those 21 pairs of populations in which a crossover occurred, with the higher-income population moving from a lower to higher age-specific date rate. In 19 of the 21 cases, the cross-

over took place because the upward slope of the rate for cardiovascular disease in the higher-income population was greater than all other causes of death for both populations. The slope of the mortality curve for the higher-income population was primarily determined by the increasing death rates from cardiovascular disease. In IS of the cases, this was the sole cause-of-death explanation. In 2 of the 21 pairs, the more rapidly-rising rate of other and unknown diseases in the higher-income population was the primary cause;
