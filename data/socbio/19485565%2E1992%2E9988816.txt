ABSTRACT: Nonuse of contraception at first intercourse among adolescents is well documented in the adolescent sexuality research literature. This study provides a formal test of the hypothesis that an increase in the courtship period (i.e., waiting time to intercourse) increases the likelihood that a couple will discuss contraception and use it at first intercourse. The data analyzed are from personal interviews with 1,314 women aged 20-29 in the 1983 National Survey of Unmarried Women. The results are mixed about the effect of waiting time on contraceptive behavior, providing weak support for the hypothesis, but also elucidating individual and relative characteristics of the couples, such as age and education of the respective partners, that affected contraceptive behavior at first intercourse. Support for the hypothesis may prove more robust in data with different characteristics from the survey used here.

Adolescent sexuality research has shown that the transition from virginity to nonvirginity typically follows a predictable course. Often, sexual initiation occurs after a period of courtship characterized by various rites of passage. Sexual activities during this period become progressively more intimate as adolescents experiment with kissing, hugging, necking, petting, and heavy petting, and often ultimately intercourse. The speed with which couples move from "early" noncoital sexual activities to sexual intercourse may have important implications for pregnancy and disease prevention among adolescents.
Waiting time to coitus is defined as the period between the beginning of a relationship and the timing of first intercourse. The length of this period is expected to affect pregnancy and disease risk-taking behavior because of its impact on the couple's opportunity and ability to communicate and to prepare themselves for sexual intercourse

(Cvetkovich and Grote, 1981; Jorgensen et al., 1980; Thompson and Spanier, 1978). Research literature on adolescent sexuality, contraception, and pregnancy is replete with empirical evidence on nonuse of contraception at the initial stages of this transition from virginity to nonvirginity (Cvetkovich and Grote, 1983; Kantner and Zelnik, 1973; Zabin, et al., 1979; Zelnik and Kantner, 1977,1978; Zelnik and Shah, 1983; Zelnik et al., 1981).
Commonly offered reasons for nonuse of contraception during this transition period center around the unexpectedness of the act of intercourse, the episodic and unplanned nature of their sexual activity, unpreparedness, lack of communication regarding contraception between partners, and failure to assume responsibility by the partners to prevent a pregnancy (Bauman, 1970; DeLamater and MacCorquodale, 1979; Maxwell et al. 1977; Morrison, 1985; Shah et al., 1975; Zelnik and Kantner, 1979; Zelnik et al.,

1981). These interrelated reasons stem from inadequate interaction between partners because of the short time spent in courtship prior to engaging in sexual intercourse. Intercourse is more predictable in an established relationship, and familiarity with a partner increases communication about contraception, the motivation to use, and the actual use of contraception (Kisker, 1985).
In this paper we explore the determinants of waiting time to coitus in a steady relationship and the effects of waiting time on contraceptive behavior. First, we examine the factors that determine the length of the waiting time within a general socio-demographic framework, and distinguish high-risk and low-risk groups based on waiting-time duration. Subsequently, we examine the effects of the waiting time on contraceptive communication and behavior.
We expect several patterns to emerge from this analysis. First, net of the impact of other socio-demographic controls, the longer the waiting time, the more likely a couple is to discuss pregnancy prevention. Similarly, the longer the waiting time is, the higher are the chances that a couple will negotiate a contraceptive method suitable to the context of their relationship. As a result, waiting time is expected to be positively associated with contraceptive use and choice of an effective method.
Waiting time has salient implications for the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) as well. The longer the waiting time, the more a couple will get to know each other, probably discussing their respective sexual histories, as well as ways to pro-

tect themselves from STDs, including AIDS. Therefore, we use the duration of the waiting time to identify those individuals who are at higher or lower risk of acquiring STD and subsequently test whether or not waiting time is associated with a preventive behavior, condom use. We were not able to test the effects of waiting time on other STD preventive behaviors due to data restrictions.
The analysis is carried out in two stages. First, we estimate multivariate equations to examine the determinants of the waiting time to first intercourse within the first long-term relationship. Subsequently, we estimate the net effect of waiting time on contraceptive behavior controlling for the effects of the socio-demographic factors introduced in the first stage. More specifically, we examine the impact of waiting time on the likelihood that the couple discussed contraception, whether or not they used a method of contraception, and method choice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data used in this paper were obtained in 1983 through personal interviews from a nationally representative sample of women aged 20-29 who had never been married. The survey, the National Survey of Unmarried Women (NSUW), was based on a stratified and clustered probability sample of households and a representative sample of women residents in college dormitories and sorority houses in the coterminous United States. The total sample comprised 1,314 women; 1,149 from the household sample, and 165 from the college dormitory sample, with response rates of 78 per cent and 82 per

cent respectively. To insure adequate representation, black women were oversampled in the household sample, but not in the college sample. Poststratification weights were added to adjust for stratification, clustering, and disproportionate sampling of areas and oversampling of blacks. Therefore, the results can be generalized to the U.S. population represented by the sample. Unless otherwise noted, all results presented in this paper are based on weighted data.
The data contain retrospective information on all heterosexual relationships which lasted three months or longer and in which sexual intercourse occurred at least once. These are referred to as long-term or steady relationships. The relationship histories include the beginning month and year of each relationship and the month and year in which intercourse within the relationship first occurred. From these, it is possible to calculate a waiting time to coitus measure as the number of months between the starting date of the relationship and the date of the first sexual intercourse within the relationship. A month is the smallest time unit with which we can measure waiting time. As is customary in demography, we assume that events occur at the midpoint of the month; events occurring in two consecutive months are assumed to be one month apart. We set the waiting time to zero for those couples for whom the beginning of the relationship and first intercourse were in the same month.
As noted above, a steady relationship is defined as one lasting three months or longer, and in which coitus has occurred. The duration restriction was imposed primarily to improve re-

call ability by focusing on long-term or steady relationships only, but this has two potential effects: First, women who were sexually active, but who never had a long-term relationship, are excluded from the analysis, because relationship-specific information is not available for these women. Yet, these women, by definition, have not waited long before they had intercourse with their partners. Consequently, the waiting time estimates are subject to an upward bias. In our sample, only 23 sexually active women had not had a three-month or longer relationship. Therefore, the bias resulting from the exclusion of these women is likely to be small. Secondly, 18 per cent of the women in the sample had never had sexual intercourse; but, one-third of these virgin women were in a steady relationship. Eventually, some of these women will have sexual intercourse with their partner, some time after the survey. These women would have contributed a longer waiting time had they not been excluded from the analysis. The average duration of such relationships is about 20 months, compared to 7.3 months of average waiting time by all women in the first relationship. Consequently, the waiting time estimates are subject to a downward bias because of this censoring effect.
Thirdly, because the smallest unit in which waiting time can be measured is a month, some amount of variation in waiting time is lost and consequently the resulting estimates of waiting time may be slightly biased. It is difficult to predict the direction of this bias because the procedure used to measure waiting time may cause some of the effects to cancel each other. But, since the analysis is confined to waiting time

186

Tanfer and Hyle

in the first relationship, the loss of variation is less likely to be problematic. As we will show later, average waiting time diminishes rapidly by relationship order. If we were to examine subsequent relationships, the lack of a more precise measurement of waiting time would cause a more serious problem. On the other hand, an attempt to retrospectively measure waiting time in units smaller than a month would have introduced a pronounced recall bias for early relationships.
Finally, the sample consists only of never-married women. This restriction precludes comparison with the premarital behavior of ever-married women and introduces a marriage selection bias. This bias is more salient for retrospective behaviors that are closely associated with the decision to marry, such as premarital pregnancy. For example, the never-married women in our sample may be older at first intercourse and less likely to have had a premarital pregnancy than a comparable sample of ever-married women. Despite these limitations, the NSUW data set is unique in that it contains detailed information necessary to construct measures of waiting time to coitus within a relationship, as well as the matched characteristics of the respondent and her partner at the beginning of the relationship.
For several conceptual and practical reasons, the analysis is confined to white women who were virgins at the beginning of their first long-term relationship. We focus on the first relationship, because it represents the transition to adulthood better than subsequent relationships. In this sample, more than 80 per cent of the women enter the first such relationship without prior sexual intercourse expe-

rience, that is, as virgins. Furthermore, the subsequent effect of waiting time on contraceptive behavior is more salient in the first relationship when a woman is less experienced than in later relationships. Evidence has shown that contraceptive behavior at first intercourse establishes a pattern for later behavior (Rindfuss et al., 1986). Finally, from an empirical standpoint, there is more variation in waiting time in the first relationship than in the ensuing relationships. Average waiting time diminishes sharply with relationship order, and without a more precise unit of measurement we find very little variation in waiting time controlling for relationship order.
We chose to focus on women who were virgins when they began their first long-term relationship because the timing of contraceptive use and method choice can be determined with more specificity for these women than for all women in their first relationship regardless of prior sexual experience. For virgins, specific information on method use and choice at first intercourse can be used to construct precise measures of contraceptive behavior. For women who entered their first steady relationship with prior intercourse experience, both the method use and the specific method used lack a clear time reference within the relationship and are therefore more ambiguous. Furthermore, in multivariate models estimated for all women, prior sexual experience appears to explain much of the variance in waiting time, as prior intercourse experience significantly (p < 0.001) reduces the length of the waiting time.
The sample was limited to white women due to the well documented racial differences in sexual behavior

among adolescents and post-teen single women (Furstenberg, 1987; Furstenberg et al., 1987; Moore et al., 1986). In early analyses, we found that race was strongly associated with the length of waiting time (p< 0.001). However, when blacks and whites were analyzed separately, the models for black women did not adequately fit the data. Evidently, the specified variables do not accurately capture the experience of black women with respect to waiting time and the subsequent effect of waiting time on contraceptive behavior. Hence, we narrowed our analysis to white women only.
CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
AND VARIABLES
The conceptual framework which consists of an individual-level sociodemographic model is presented in Figure 1. According to this framework, waiting time to coitus is viewed as a function of the woman's, her partner's, and the couple's relative characteristics at the beginning of the relationship. This model is based on the view that the transition from virginity to nonvirginity is the culmination of a process

that may have begun in very early adolescence, around pubescence. Consequently, individual background and current characteristics influence the timing of this transition (Bauman and Udry, 1981; Billy and Udry, 1983; Hofferth, 1987; National Research Council, 1987; Udry, 1979; Udry and Billy, 1987; Zelnik et al., 1981). Furthermore, behavior within a relationship is likely to be a product of both partners' traits, and therefore it is as much influenced by the male partner as by the female partner. The relative characteristics of the partners may reflect the balance of power in the relationship and the bargaining position of each partner. Thus we expect a woman's and her partner's relative characteristics to have significant effects on waiting time.
The specific indicators used in this analysis reflect the background characteristics of the woman, the prior experience of the partner, and the relative ages, educational attainment, and religious affiliation of both partners at the beginning of the relationship. Age is used primarily as a control variable. Past research has shown that more adolescents are becoming sexually active

188

at earlier ages (National Research Council, 1987; Pratt et al., 1984). Hence, we expect waiting time to vary inversely across the age range of the women in our sample. The relative age of the partners is measured as the difference in years of age at the beginning of the relationship. These differences are then collapsed into three categories reflecting an older female partner, an older male partner, and same age partners (plus or minus one year). We expect that the older partner is likely to hold more power within the relationship, to play the dominant role, and to have persuasive advantage in sexual bargaining. Where the woman is the older partner, we expect that she will be able to delay the consummation of the relationship. Conversely, an older, more experienced, male partner is expected to shorten the waiting time to coitus. Overall, we anticipate that waiting time will be inversely related to the woman's age and curvilinearly related to relative age.
Woman's education represents a number of dimensions. Educational attainment may indicate career aspirations and ambitions that may inhibit early initiation of sexual activity. Adolescent girls who place little value on educational attainment are likely to have intercourse at an early age (Devaney and Hubley, 1981; Furstenberg, 1976; Hogan and Kitagawa, 1985; Mott, 1983; Moore et al., 1985). Yet, relatively well-educated women may be better informed about reproduction and birth control and be prepared for sexual activity, thus reducing waiting time. We expect women's education will be inversely associated with waiting time. Similar to the measurement of relative age, relative education is the

difference in the partners' years of schooling, collapsed into three categories. Partner's education in relation to the woman's education is expected to have a depressing effect on waiting time, because the bargaining positions of the partners is likely to be determined by their relative status.
Numerous studies have shown that religion and religiosity have a strong influence on the timing of the initiation of sexual activity (Devaney and Hubley, 1981; Inazu and Fox, 1980; Jessor and Jessor, 1975; Tanfer and Horn, 1985; Zelnik et al., 1981). Differences in norms, values, and beliefs exist across major religions regarding premarital sexual behavior. Protestant fundamentalism, for example, has been frequently associated with strong conservative positions on issues of sexual behavior. Catholicism, on the other hand, which was once regarded as a good index of conservatism on moral issues, has more recently found to be a less reliable predictor of sexual behavior (Devaney and Hubley, 1981; Hofferth, 1987; Thornton and Camburn, 1983). The effect of such normative constraints, or the lack of them, is expected to be reflected by the differences in waiting time among various religious affiliations, such that, conservative Protestant women will have the longest waiting time intervals, followed by Catholics, other Protestants, and lastly by women with other or no religious affiliation having the shortest waiting periods. The religious homogamy variable is included to measure the independent effects of reinforcing versus conflicting normative pressures. The effect of religion on waiting time may be attenuated in relationships where the couples hold dissimilar reli-

gious beliefs, while couples with similar beliefs are likely to reinforce each other. Partner's marital status is used as a proxy for his previous sexual experience, which also may determine the extent of his power within the relationship.
Mother's education is included as a proxy measure for socioeconomic background and parental aspirations. Other research shows that parents with more education are generally more affluent than parents with less education, and that children who come from families with more educated parents tend to be more goal and achievement oriented (Conger, 1973; Davies and Kandel, 1981; Spenner and Featherman, 1978). These characteristics may decrease the likelihood of engaging in premarital intercourse during adolescence (Chilman, 1980). Hence, we expect mother's education to be positively associated with waiting time. Likewise, we use family structure when the woman was growing up (both parents vs one or no parent) to approximate family socioeconomic status, as well as the level and quality of parental support and control during the transition years. Single-parent families, especially those headed by single females, are generally less well-off than two-parent families, and they provide less parental supervision than that in intact families. Consequently, women who grew up in a nonintact family are more likely to have intercourse at a younger age, and we expect waiting time for these women to be shorter than it is for women who grew up with both parents (Zelnik et al., 1981; Newcomer and Udry, 1983; Moore et al., 1985).
The right-hand side of the conceptual framework represents the effects

of waiting time on contraceptive behavior. Waiting time is expected to influence contraceptive use and method choice both directly and indirectly through contraceptive communication between the partners. The latter is posited as a direct function of the waiting time within a relationship.
It has been shown in other research that with increasing commitment to the relationship couples are less embarrassed about sexual issues and more likely to communicate openly about these issues. In turn, increased communication within the sexual dyad regarding pregnancy prevention is very reliably associated with more efficacious contraception (Cvetkovich and Grote, 1981;DeLamater and MacCorquadale, 1978; Oskamp and Mindick, 1983; Thompson and Spanier, 1978). Our hypotheses regarding the relationship between waiting time and contraceptive behavior are that the longer the waiting time, the more likely is a couple to discuss contraception; to use contraception; and to choose an effective method. Two measures of contraceptive behavior are the use or nonuse of any method at first intercourse, and the specific method used at first intercourse. The latter measure is operationalized in four categories: pill/IUD, condom, all other methods, and no method. The pill and the IUD are combined in a distinct category because each requires medical intervention and, with the exception of sterilization, are the most effective methods. The condom is placed in a category by itself, because it is a male method, it requires partner cooperation, and it is an effective protection against STDs. All other methods were combined together because of their

relative ineffectiveness in preventing pregnancy and due to sample size concerns. We treat the use of no method as an additional contraceptive choice because of theoretical reasons that are discussed below.
METHODS
As we mentioned above, the analysis is carried out in two stages. In the first, a logged-transformed waiting time to coitus measure is entered in an OLS regression on indicators of the woman's, and the couple's relative characteristics at the beginning of the relationship. The logarithmic transformation is suggested by Weisberg (1985) when the range of the dependent variable is very broad. Because the log of zero is not defined, log(waiting time + 1) was the final transformation used in the analysis. The effect of the logarithmic transformation is a more normal distribution of waiting time to coitus and a reduction in the influence of outliers.
In the second stage of the analysis, a series of logistic regression equations are estimated. We first add a categorical length of waiting time variable to the social-demographic individual level model which predicts whether or not a couple discussed contraceptive use. Next, both waiting time and contraceptive communication variables are added sequentially to the sociodemographic model to predict the use or nonuse of contraception. And finally, the waiting time and contraceptive communication variables are entered into a polytomous logistic regression model predicting the method used by the couple.
In the analysis with the dichotomous variables (contraceptive communica-

tion: yes/no; contraceptive use/nonuse), logistic regression is used to estimate the effects of the independent variables (Aldrich and Nelson, 1984). In logistic regression, the dependent variable is transformed into the natural logarithm of the odds of being in one category versus the other. The model provides maximum likelihood estimates that fit independent variables to a logistic response function (Hanushek and Jackson, 1977). In the model with a dichotomous dependent variable the coefficients represent reductions or increases in the log odds of the conditional probability of being in one category of the dependent variable as against the other. The coefficients are interpreted relative to the omitted reference category of the predictor variable. Coefficients of 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 are equal to metric odds of 1 to 1.6, 2.1, and 2.7, respectively. The coefficients in the polytomous logistic regression represent the log odds of choosing one method relative to choosing another method (or no method). For example, in predicting pill/IUD use versus no method, for a specific category of the predictor variable, a beta coefficient of 0.70 indicates that we are two times more likely to observe pill/IUD use than to observe no contraception, for women in that category of the predictor variable. In contrast a beta coefficient of 0.40, for another category of the predictor, would imply 1.5 times greater likelihood of observing pill/IUD use compared to no method. Thus, the beta coefficients may be interpreted as the amount of change in the log odds associated with either a unit change in the predictor variable, or being in one category versus another of the predictor variable.

The bivariate relationships between waiting time and each of the independent variables included in our conceptual model are shown in Table 2. The two family background variables do not appear to have any effect. Neither family structure at age 15 nor mother's educational attainment seems to be associated with the length of the waiting time. But, the older the woman, or her partner, the shorter is the interval between the beginning of a relationship and the timing of first coitus. The decline is sharpest after age 15, then a gradual reduction in the length of the waiting time is observed. Educational attainment, of both men and women at the beginning of the relationship, shows a similar pattern. We observe a 50 per cent reduction in waiting time from less-than-high-school to highschool completion, followed by virtually no change in waiting time thereafter. This similarity between the patterns of the age and education effects is not surprising, since age and education are highly correlated at this stage of the life cycle (r = 0.74 for women; r = 0.54 for men).
The couple's relative age and educational attainment, on the other hand, show a weak association with waiting time and not always in the expected direction. When the partner is two or more years older than the woman, waiting time is reduced substantially. Yet, when the partner's education is two or more years higher than that of the woman, contrary to our hypothesis, the waiting time either increases or is not affected at all. The waiting time is shortest when the woman has two or more years of schooling than her partner; but, only a small group of women in this sample had more schooling than their partner. Religious affiliation has a

weak relationship with waiting time. Protestant men and women seem to wait longer than those who are Catholic, and they wait longer than men and women who are affiliated with another religion, or no religion, before they engage in sexual intercourse. Finally, waiting time is significantly shorter if the partner has prior marital experience. It should be noted, however, that partner's marital status is highly correlated with his age, and a very small proportion of the partners had ever been married.
PREDICTING WAITING TIME
In the next stage, waiting time was regressed on the woman's and the couple's relative characteristics (Table 3). When only the woman's characteristics are included, waiting time is positively influenced (i.e., increased) by the mother's education and negatively influenced (i.e., decreased) by the woman's own education. The relationship between religious affiliation and waiting time is still weak. The waiting time is significantly shorter only for women in the other or no-religion category. Catholic and nonconservative Protestant women are not significantly different from conservative Protestant women in terms of waiting time. In the second model, the partner's marital status and the couple's relative characteristics have both direct and indirect effects on waiting time. The inclusion of the partners' relative characteristics reduces the effect of the mother's education, and the coefficient for the Catholic affiliation attains statistical significance. Waiting time is reduced if the partner has any type of marital experience, or if he has a higher educational attainment than the woman. The effect on waiting time of religious homogamy

is as expected: Couples with the same religious affiliation are likely to wait longer before they engage in sexual intercourse than couples in which partners have different affiliations. This effect is possibly a result of the reinforcement of the normative constraints on premarital sexual behavior when the partners' beliefs coincide.

Because of its strong correlation with the other variables, neither the woman's nor the partner's relative age was taken into account in the first two models. The effect of this correlation is demonstrated by the results of the third model. The inclusion of the woman's age and the age homogamy variables drastically reduces the effects

on waiting time of all the other variables in the first two models, with the lone exception of the woman's religion. The older a woman is at the time the relationship began, the sooner she tends to have intercourse with her partner. The couples's age homogamy variable also has the expected effect on waiting time, which is considerably shorter if the male partner is two or more years older than the female partner. It is noteworthy that, even though the age effect dominates this model and eliminates the significance of almost all of the other variables, the amount of variation explained (R2) increases subtantially.

EFFECTS OF WAITING TIME
The effect of waiting time on the likelihood of contraceptive communication between partners and on contraceptive use and method choice was examined next. Our hypothesis regarding contraceptive communication was that, the longer the waiting time to coitus, the more likely a couple is to discuss pregnancy prevention prior to having intercourse. We tested this hypothesis by regressing a dichotomous variable of whether or not the couple discussed using contraception (yes/no) on a categorical waiting time variable ( < 1 month, 1-3 months, and > 3 months), first without, and then with controls for the woman's, and the couple's relative characteristics (Model 1 and Model 2, respectively). Waiting time does not appear to have a significant effect on the likelihood of contraceptive communication (Table 4). In the first model without controls, couples who had intercourse in the same month their relationship began

are less likely to have discussed using contraception than couples who waited one to three months. Couples who waited longer than three months are not any more likely to have discussed pregnancy prevention than the couples in the 1-3 months reference group. The effect of the waiting time further erodes when controls are introduced. There is no significant difference in the likelihood of having discussed contraceptive use between those who waited less than one month and those who waited longer, even though the signs are in the expected direction. This does not necessarily mean there is no relationship between waiting time and the likelihood of contraceptive communication between partners. We may not have been able to demonstrate it with these data because the timing of this communication is somewhat ambiguous. We can not be certain whether or not the discussion of contraceptive use actually preceded the couple's first intercourse. The absence of a more

we regressed a four-category method choice variable on waiting time with and without controlling for contraceptive communication, and woman's and the couple's relative characteristics. The results lend a weak support for our hypothesis regarding the effect of waiting time on contraceptive use, but several patterns emerge.
First, longer waiting time to first intercourse (four months or longer) is positively associated with pill or IUD use. The likelihood of pill/IUD use is substantially higher among women who waited four months or more, especially when the effects of woman's and partner's characteristics are controlled. For example, compared to the women in the reference category, women who waited at least four months are nearly three times more likely to use the pill or the IUD than to use no method at all (Table 7, cols. 13 and 14). Likewise, women who waited

four or more months before engaging in intercourse are more than twice as likely to choose the pill or the IUD over the condom, as women whosefirst intercourse was within the first three months of the relationship (Table 7, cols. 19 and 20).
Second, short waiting time (less than one month) appears to be inversely associated with the likelihood of using condoms, especially in the absence of controls for individual and relative characteristics. Women who waited less than one month prior to the first intercourse are more than twice as likely to use no method than to use condoms, relative to the reference group of women who waited one to three months before engaging in intercourse (Table 7, cols. 3, 4, and 15). They also seem to be more likely tochoose a method other than the condom, if they do use a method at all (Table 7, cols. 7, 8, 11, and 12).

Third, as we observed above, there appears to be a distinct group of women among the nonwaiters who start a relationship already equipped with an effective contraceptive method. This is apparent from the higher likelihood of choosing the pill over condom, even if the waiting time is less than one month (Table 7, cols. 7,8,19, and 20).
Fourth, regardless of waiting time, contraceptive communication significantly increases the adoption of condom or other methods, but has no effect on the adoption of the pill or the IUD (Table 7, cols. 4, 6, 16, 18, and 20). This finding makes intuitive sense because pill and IUD are coitus independent female methods, for which there is little need for discussion with partner. Moreover, if the women begin a relationship having already started using the pill or the IUD, this would further reduce the need for contraceptive communication. All other contraceptive methods are coitus dependent and require partner participation or cooperation. Hence, contraceptive communication has a significant effect in the adoption of these methods.
SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
The nonuse of contraception at first intercourse among adolescents is a well-documented finding in the adolescent sexuality research literature. The various explanations share a common underlying factor which centers on the lack of time spent in courtship prior to the beginning of a sexual relationship. The present analysis provides a formal test of the hypothesis that an increase in the courtship period (i.e., waiting time to intercourse) increases the likelihood that a couple will discuss con-

traception, and use it at first intercourse.
The results suggest that the current individual and relative characteristics of the couples, and the prevailing normative constraints have greater salience to the timing of the first intercourse than such background characteristics as mother's education and family structure. For instance, the number of years of schooling is inversely associated with the length of the waiting time. Partner's higher education relative to that of the woman also reduces the length of the waiting time. Two factors may account for the quickening of the pace of this transition. First, women with higher educational attainment are both better informed about reproduction and birth control and more prepared for sexual activity. Secondly, if the partner has more schooling than the woman, he is also likely to have a more dominant role in the relationship. Thus, he can be more persuasive in determining the timing of the first intercourse. This would be expected to have a depressing effect on waiting time, as seems to be the case. Furthermore, affiliation with conservative religious doctrines that actively proscribe premarital sexual behavior tends to increase the length of the courtship period. These effects are tempered by age; older women and women with older partners tend to wait less.
There are mixed results concerning the effect of waiting time on contraceptive behavior with weak support for our hypotheses. The likelihood that a couple will discuss contraception is not affected significantly by the length of the courtship period that precedes sexual intercourse. The effect of waiting

200

time on contraceptive behavior is in the expected direction. There is some evidence that longer waiting time increases not only contraceptive use but also the likelihood of pill and IUD use. We have also found evidence that some women enter the relationship already using the pill or the IUD, possibly because they expect to have intercourse. For these women, waiting time is irrelevant in terms of contraception. The inherent inaccuracies in the measurement of its timing notwithstanding, contraceptive communication is strongly associated with the adoption of coitus-dependent methods that require partner cooperation.
There are various reasons why some of these results are not more robust and conclusive. One possible reason for the absence of a significant relationship between waiting time and contraceptive communication may have been the lack of specificity in the timing of the discussion regarding contraception. It was not always clear that the variable measured contraceptive communication prior to first intercourse. Other concerns are data quality and measurement issues. For example, the date of the beginning of a relationship is seldom punctuated by a salient event. Therefore, it is especially vulnerable to recall errors. Consequently, the required precision in the waiting time measure may be diminished. Partner characteristics, if and when contraception was discussed, whether or not a method was used, and what method was chosen are all subject to similar distortions caused by inaccurate recall.
In addition, the measurement of waiting time in months, rather than in smaller units (e.g., days), yields a leftskewed distribution, resulting in a loss of variation. The exclusion from the

analysis of women whose first-ever intercourse was outside a long-term relationship (/z = 93) may have also stabilized some of the variation by waiting time in the contraceptive behavior patterns. These women would not have waited long before they engaged in sexual intercourse; a great majority of them would not have used a method at first intercourse (68 per cent); and a very small minority would have used the pill or the IUD (9 per cent), or condoms (8 per cent).
Nonetheless, these data support the existence of a relationship between waiting time to coitus and pregnancy risk-taking. Waiting time has an influence on a couple's ability to prepare themselves for sexual intercourse. The longer the waiting time, the more likely a couple is to use contraception at first intercourse, and the more likely they are to choose an effective method. Future analyses should take this and other aspects of the courtship period into account when examining contraceptive behavior. The confirmation of these relationships would facilitate targeting high-risk populations for pregnancy, and disease-prevention interventions.
