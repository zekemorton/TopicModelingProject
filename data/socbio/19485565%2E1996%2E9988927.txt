ABSTRACT: This study evaluates the impact of the Trivers-Willard (T-W) effect on human populations, using demographic data collected from vital registration data in Venezuela. The evaluation of the sex ratio at birth (SRB) and of fetal and infant deaths supports the existence of T-W effect in the Venezuelan population in extreme conditions. This T-W effect was observable in the SRB but not at later ages and is related to the marital status of the mother. The results indicate that the investment in females associated with environmental adversity is greater than the investment in males associated with good environmental conditions.

biases in fetal mortality during the first stages of gestation can be very difficult to measure, given the possibility of early losses passing unnoticed. Nevertheless, sex biases at birth and mortality through perinatal, infant, child, and adolescent periods can be easily measured from the vital registration data that is normally recollected through the population offices of several countries.
Evidence from several species supports the Trivers-Willard (T-W) hypothesis (Austad and Sunquist, 1986; Blaffer-Hrdy, 1988; Clutton-Brock et al., 1982, 1984, 1986; Gosling, 1986; McClure, 1981). Even apparent departures from the T-W prediction can be explained as special characteristics of the social structure or mating arrangements of that species, which explain the convenience of the reallocation of resources according to other criteria (Altmann et al., 1988; Gomendio, 1990). Nevertheless, in humans, relatively few efforts have been made to test directly the T-W hypothesis although indirect evidence exists (Clutton-Brock et al., 1985,1986; Trivers and Willard, 1973).
Several studies have evaluated the differential parental investment for sex in humans, strongly suggesting its existence. From eleven authors who reported their results evaluating directly the T-W effect, nine presented significant effects in the predicted direction, and the other two had not controlled relevant variables or had wrong mechanisms for hypothesis testing (Brittain et al., 1988; Chagnon, 1979). The results of the studies that point to a T-W effect in humans present evidence of sex biases in mortality and sex biases in allocating resources and care.

SEX BIASES IN MORTALITY
a.-Dickemann (1975, 1979) reported a higher incidence of female infanticide and a higher sex ratio (more males than females) in upper socioeconomic levels of some European and Asian families between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries, especially in India, and related it to other behaviors that conferred a reproductive strategy to maximize reproductive success of higher status families;
b. --Parents report greater bereavement at the death of a healthy male in comparison with the death of an unhealthy male or a daughter (Littlefield and Rushton, 1986);
c.-- Voland (1988) reports the presence of differential mortality by sex in Germany during the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, finding that land-owners were the only ones not showing a higher male infant mortality;
d.-- Contemporary North American society presents a higher male postneonatal mortality in all socioeconomic levels, but this higher male mortality is less marked at increased educational levels of both parents and changes with the mother's age. Married women have less marked male infant mortality than women without a stable pair-bond (Abernethy and Yip, 1990).
SEX BIASES IN ALLOCATING RESOURCES
AND CARE
a. --Fifteenth and sixteenth-century Portuguese nobility allocated economic resources differentially by sex and by relative nobility position. This allocation was related to the reproductive success of these societies, where the females of the lower nobility, re-

ceiving dowries, and the males of the higher nobility receiving estates, outreproduced their counterparts (Boone, 1986);
b. -- Ifalukese higher status males spend more time with their sons and lower status males spend more time with their daughters (Betzig and Turke, 1986);
c.--Contemporary North American society leaves legacies only in higher echelons of society, and legacies for males are of a higher amount than those for females (Smith et al., 1987);
d.--The parents of the Mukogodo tribe (Cronk, 1989, 1991), one of the poorest neighbors of East African populations, may invest more milk and resources for medical attention in female infants, which have higher reproductive success than their brothers, and they have a female-biased sex ratio between birth and 4 years of age.
e. --North American mothers of higher SES have a higher probability of supplying maternal milk to males and wait time for the next child when a male was born, while mothers of lower SES have a higher probability of breastfeeding females and have longer birth spacing for the next child when a girl was born previously (Gaulin and Robbins, 1991). The presence of a resident partner with the mother exerts a higher effect in the parental investment than income (a SES indicator), suggesting that psychological support may be very important (Gaulin and Robbins, 1991).
EVIDENCE AGAINST THE T-W EFFECT
Chagnon et al (1979) presented evidence against the T-W prediction from Yanomami society, given the fact that

although the leaders of the tribes had nearly double the reproductive success of other males, they did not present any sex ratio bias in their living children. Nevertheless, this work has not taken into account that there may be an absence of correlation between the fathers and the offspring characteristics, as these men have several wives and their relative higher resource predictability might not be at the disposition of the individual offspring. In fact, a higher correlation between females' resource predictability and the sexratio of their children (Trivers and Willard, 1973), would be expected in polygamous societies.
Brittain et al. (1988) found no correlation between mortality sex ratio bias and economic change. Nevertheless, they did not explore the association between the socioeconomic strata of their population and the sex ratio, but they compared the sex ratio according to the economic indicators of the French West Indian population along the years. The sex ratio biases of the populations are related to the relative costs and reproductive success of each sex as it has been presented by other authors (Fisher, 1930; Myers, 1978). Trivers and Willard (1973) make predictions about the dispersion of this central tendency or equilibrium point within the populations, not about the total sex ratio value of the population, which means that these types of hypotheses are complementary and do not contradict each other (Oksanen, 1981).
One argument presented against the T-W effect (Johansson, 1984; Brittain et al., 1988) suggests that very poor societies present a high incidence of female infanticide. Nevertheless, the

studies that compared female infanticide within the Bangladesh population during a famine between 1974 and 1975 (Bairagi, 1986) and infant mortality statistics (Bhuiya et al., 1989; Das Gupta, 1987) found a selective disadvantage for female children in richer or higher-educated strata of the societies. Thus, here a higher SES could improve female infant nourishment conditions in more educated sectors of the population (Bairagi, 1986), but it did not, as is predicted by the T-W effect.
The evolutionary causes for behaviors need some possible proximal mechanism to explain the mechanisms of action of that evolutionary cause (Wilson, 1975). The proximate mechanisms for the T-W effect in humans can be physiological, behavioral, or both (Cronk, 1991; Gaulin and Robbins, 1991).
Socioeconomic indicators and psychological well being, as well as hormonal equilibrium, can be very important and related to different aspects of human behavior (Cronk, 1989). In humans, evidence points to the importance of hormonal equilibrium for sex ratio of the offspring (James, 1987, 1989, 1990a, 1990ft). Physiological and behavioral proximate mechanisms could affect the offspring before and after birth and could act through the mother and the father, although Trivers and Willard (1973) suggested that the mother should be responsible for the differential investment effect. After birth there can exist also behavioral differences between the sexes for allocating resources like feeding, medical attention, access to education, or any other resource that could be invested differentially (Bairagi, 1986; Chen et al., 1981; Cronk, 1989, 1991; D'Souza

and Chen, 1980; Fix, 1990; Nadarajah, 1983).
Clutton-Brock and Iason (1986) have proposed that hormonal mechanisms mediated by environmental conditions may be responsible for the sex ratio variation. After birth, proximate mechanisms could be related to hormonal changes after psychological and physiological distress in the mother (Gaulin and Robbins, 1991) affecting milk production or psychological welfare. It has been proposed that milk production diminishes with psychological distress (Huffman and Lamphere, 1984). Nevertheless, the sex ratio relationship with hormone levels changes between species. The same hormone may have opposite effects on the SRB in different species (James, 1989). None of the behavioral or physiological changes needed for the differential investment need to be conscious, not even in the human species, to have some populational impact (Gaulin and Robbins, 1991).
In this paper we explore in a crosssectional study the differences in the sex ratio at birth (SRB), and fetal and infant deaths (males/total births) between sectors of the Venezuelan population, evaluating then the population impact of the Trivers-Willard effect. Some evidence indicates that the marital status of the woman influences the potential parental investment that can be allocated to the offspring (Abernethy and Yip, 1990; Gaulin and Robbins, 1991). Moreover, legal and consensual unions show differences in partner selectivity (Jaffe and ChaconPuignau, 1995), pair stability (Ebanks and Loaiza, 1989; Potter and Ojeda, 1982), and indicators of pair interaction such as coital frequency (Ebanks

and Loaiza, 1989). This evidence points to the need for evaluating the SES effect on SRB differentially, according to the couple's marital status.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study used the 1988 and 1990 Venezuelan death and birth registers, respectively. These data were provided by the Venezuelan Central Office of Statistics and Information (OCEI), which stores, checks, and organizes the information, which is highly reliable according to internal consistency measures.
The data on fetal and infant deaths (N = 87,229) included information about gestational time (fetal deaths) or age of the child, place of medical attention (hospital or clinic), presence or absence of medical attention at the moment of death, birth order, number of previous dead siblings, age, and educational and occupational level of the mother.
The birth registers (N = 577,976) included information regarding marital status of the mother and years of relationship between parents, place of birth, medical assistance during birth, type of birth, birth order, number of previous fetal deaths, parents' ages, educational and occupational levels. A comparison of both parents' ages, education, and occupational levels was also included, with three categories for each (man with a higher level than woman, equal levels for both parents, or woman with a higher level than man) and the type of pair according to the literacy of both members (both literate, both illiterate, woman illiterate, or man illiterate).
Marital status was classified as: mar-

ried (legally established couples), unmarried (couples living together without marriage), and single (women who do not live with the father of their child).
Educational level was classified in four categories: did not finish primary school, finished primary school, did not finish high school and finished high school or higher education. Occupation was classified according to the educational level needed to perform the task: white collar worker, clerical, blue collar, and home or no occupation.
The data were processed initially using an IBM-4381 mainframe and further processing was made through the SPSS software package and specially designed calculus work sheets in personal computers.
We used a stepwise discriminant analysis to evaluate the influence of the variables studied on the probability of the child born being a male or a female. This procedure allowed us to control for the high correlation that exists between several of the variables of the study (parents' ages, education, and occupational levels). The first discriminant analysis included mother's marital status. After finding significant results for this variable, separate discriminant functions were performed for each marital status (single, unmarried, and married mothers).
We report the sex ratios at birth for the categories of all the variables used in this work, including those that entered in the discriminant analysis, and the percentage of deviation of this sex ratio from the "global" sex ratio for each marital status. A univariate comparison for every variable is also presented, with the chi-square significances of association tests.

RESULTS
The sex ratio at birth (number of male births/number of total births = SRB) for the Venezuelan population was 0.5124, which coincides with the usual levels, that are around 0.5098 and 0.5169 (Teitelbaum, 1972; Chahnazarian, 1988) and is almost identical to the sex ratio reported for Venezuela by other authors using independent databases (0.5127, Feitosa and Krieger, 1992).
The first stepwise discriminant analysis over the SRB yielded a significant result (Wilk's lambda converted to chisquare = 57.416, df = 7; p < 0.0001) and included the marital status of the mother, which allowed us to perform separate discriminant analysis for the three marital status categories. The SRB for married and cohabiting (unmarried) mothers was very similar (0.512 and 0.514, respectively), but lower for single women (0.508).
The discriminant functions for the three marital status categories were all significant (Table 1) for the different variables studied and explained in all cases small but significant percentages of the variance in the SRB. The biological and sociodemographic variables evaluated share a higher percentage of the variance with the sex of the newborn for single compared to married

and unmarried mothers, suggesting that the T-W effect may be more powerful in women who do not live with a male partner.
From the 15 variables included in the discriminant functions, six were entered for the married couples, seven for the unmarried couples, and eight for single females (Table 2). Only birth's cohort size and number of born children entered all the marital statuses' discriminant functions, suggesting that these variables are consistently related to sex ratio. Other variables differed according to marital status (Table 3). None of the other variables that entered the discriminant functions were shared by unmarried and single mothers. Medical assistance and type of pair according to literacy entered in the two discriminant analysis functions for mother's cohabiting with a partner, married or not. Mother's education and occupation entered the married and single parents' discriminant functions. None of the father's characteristics entered the single or married status functions.
Most of the variables that entered the discriminant functions also presented significant associations with the chi-square evaluation. Nevertheless, results differed according to the type of statistical evaluation. The results of the variables that entered the discriminant

--for married mothers, when it is not a multiple birth, with medical assistance, when the mother has a high educational level, and when both parents are literate; --for unmarried mothers, where the birth corresponds to the first child with medical assistance during delivery, when the father has completed a high educational level and is relatively young, and when both parents are literate and of similar ages; --for single mothers, when the birth is for the first child in relationships less than one year in length, and when the woman has completed at least high school.
The percentage of deviation from the sex ratio of the population varied little, although significantly, with a maximum deviation of --6.77 for those pairs where the mother is married and having a multiple birth. The negative deviations are larger in magnitude than

the positive deviations, their mean value being -1.352 compared to 0.728 for the positive ones (t value = 7.01; p< 0.001).
There is heterocedasticity in the SRB deviations when comparing data for the three marital statuses (BarttletBox's F = 5.899; p = 0.003). The higher range of dispersion was found for the SRB's of single women (-5.1670 to +4.1140) and of married mothers (-6.777 to +1.923) in comparison with unmarried mothers (-2.765 to +2.214).
The sex ratio of fetal deaths was 0.562 and for infant deaths was 0.574. There were no differences in these sex ratios for any of the SES indicators. Differences were found for type of birth and gestational time for the fetuses, presenting a higher male mortality for single births (0.565) and early gestational times (0.593). Infant deaths presented a higher sex ratio for mothers between 30 and 34 years of age

1.--Multiple births imply less investment than single births, given the higher morbidity and mortality risk for the newborn;
2.--The absence of medical assistance and at least one parent's illiteracy is an indicator of extreme poverty, which is associated with lower SRB;
3.--Higher educational level of both parents is associated with higher SRB;
4.--A first child with a young father (for unmarried pairs or single women) or from a mother in a very recent relationship (single women) can receive a higher amount of-parental investment, as the reproductive period is just beginning;
5.--Similar socioeconomic conditions between both members of the pair (unmarried couples) can improve the stability of the couple, raising the potential paternal investment in the future.
Besides providing evidence for the possible existence of the TriversWillard effect at birth in the Venezuelan population, and the similarity of the results with previous reported associations for SRB (Chahnazarian, 1988; James, 1989, 1990a, 19906), our data point to other interesting phenomena which are not directly included in the original T-W considerations:
1.--The T-W effect on differential sex survival in this population exerts its effects very early, previous to conception or during the development before birth;
2. --There is a very high stability of the sex ratio in the population;
3.--Negative effects of socioeconomic status on SRB are of higher magnitude than positive ones;
4.--The Trivers-Willard effect differs according to the type of marital status of the woman, which can be an indicator of potential paternal investment.

Fetal and infant mortality indicated no effect on SRB for any of the socioeconomic indicators, different from what has been observed in contemporary North American society (Abernethy and Yip, 1990). The only effect observed was that fetal sex ratio was higher for earlier pregnancy times. It is possible that the differential parental investment exerts its effect on mortality before delivery, very early during the development period or before conception, given the relatively high amount of energy invested before birth. Differential mortality should occur early in the period of parental investment (Maynard Smith, 1980). This finding implies that evaluating the sex ratio distortion in North American society could be very helpful in understanding the results of differential mortalities (Abernethy and Yip, 1990), given the possibility of a higher impact of the T-W effect in this group. It is also possible that there exists differences in the type of data evaluated, or in reporting procedures.
The stability of the SRB is evident, since only small percentages of change are observed, even in relatively extreme conditions. Moreover, the negative deviations of the sex ratio according to socioeconomic indicators are of higher magnitude than the positive ones, suggesting that environmental adversity leads to an investment in females that is greater than that in males occasioned by environmental advantage.
It is possible that in Western contemporary cultures the Trivers-Willard proposition exerts its effect through sex biases in allocation of resources (favoring males) in good socioeconomic conditions and sex biases in

mortality or differential probability of birth (favoring females) in extreme poverty conditions. This hypothesis is also supported by Abernethy and Yip's results (1990), where higher male mortality is less marked at increased educational levels of both parents and of married women. This proposition means that in extreme poverty conditions, the T-W effect leads to higher birth or survival probability for females; in very good conditions, resource allocation for males is enhanced.
This stability of the SRB is more pronounced in unmarried mothers compared to married and single mothers, according to ranges of dispersion and canonical correlation of the SRB. Results indicate that the T-W effect on SRB varies according to the mother's marital status. Being single reduces the probability of bearing a male, in comparison with mothers cohabiting with a male (married or not), and implies a higher association of socioeconomic factors with the sex of the child.
This higher relationship between socioeconomic indicators and a male birth probability for single mothers can be related to the fact that single women can be expected to depend in their rearing activities more on themselves than on their partners, and thus, socioeconomic factors are more important.
This finding coincides with findings of previous studies where single mothers had a lower mean lactating time for males than the mothers with a coresident male (Gaulin and Robbins, 1991) and with the results that indicate that the relative female advantage at infant survival was higher when the mothers were not married (Abernethy and Yip, 1990) in contemporary societies. Thus,

the economic and psychological support of a cohabiting male in Western culture appears to be important.
Nevertheless, results for married and unmarried mothers differ, and that is probably related to the relative amount of parental investment that mothers might expect from their partners and from themselves. The father's characteristics entered the discriminant functions only for the SRB of unmarried mothers, indicating that the relative investment that these partners can provide is relevant when the mother has a coresident male, but the union is not legally established, i.e., she expects little or no support from her partner as in single women. Age similarity, which can be an indicator of pair stability as it reflects higher age assortativeness, entered to predict the SRB for unmarried pairs, indicating that the stability of the pair can be relevant for future investment, as it has been reported that consensual unions are less stable in time (Ebanks and Loaiza, 1989). Thus, as Trivers and Willard (1973) predicted, the mother's characteristics are more important for the differential parental investment, but the presence of a father and his possibilities of support seem to be important, especially when he is present, but the union is not legally established.
The higher dispersion in the SRB deviations found for married couples in comparison with unmarried ones can be related to the characteristics of the type of pair and deserves further attention. This dispersion could be related to the differences found between these types of union in selectivity, stability, and reproductive success. It is possible that socioeconomic factors can exert their effects on the relationships in a
