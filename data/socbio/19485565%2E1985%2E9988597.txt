ABSTRACT:This study examines the social and biological determinants of age at first marriage in two townships in northern Taiwan, one very rural and traditional and the other urban and modernized. For a sample of 5,707 once-married women a path analysis was performed in which age at first marriage was considered a function of age, educational attainment, urban origin, premarital labor-force participation, and age at menarche. Age at menarche, with a positive effect on the dependent variable, was the most important direct cause of age at first marriage. Although exogenous variables associated with modernization (urban origin, educational attainment and younger age) had a positive direct effect on age at first marriage, they also had a negative indirect effect on age at first marriage through their negative direct effect on age at menarche.

There is a broad body of literature which addresses the question, "What are the determinants of age at first marriage for women?" Most research has focused on the effects of socioeconomic factors including educational achievement, socioeconomic status, labor force participation, urban vs rural residence, religion and ethnicity. By and large, researchers have neglected to include the influences of biological factors on the age of first marriage. Clearly, there is a relationship between these socioeconomic factors and one's nutritional state; this, in turn, will influence a girl's maturation rate and general development.
Especially in traditional societies, like Taiwan, sexual behavior is generally associated with marriage. Since sexual behavior is most often initiated after puberty, marriage for females usually occurs after menarche. Again, in traditional societies most particularly, one of the primary functions of marriage is re-

production, which for the female requires the maturation of the hormonal system and the initiation of the menstrual cycle. This is not to say that menarche is a necessary prerequisite to sexual behavior or marriage. Rather, in a society in which the reproductive function is emphasized, the appearance of menstruation becomes an important sign of suitability for marriage and motherhood. In such a cultural environment, females with later menarche will tend to marry later than those whose menarche appears earlier.
No matter how traditional, Taiwan is also in the process of modernization. Modernization may be defined as socioeconomic development and technological improvement. The experience of modernization, in general, tends to increase urbanization and educational attainment. On the one hand, increments in urbanization and educational attainment lead to a decrease in age at first marriage. On the other hand, both mod-

ical maturity, women's age at first marriage is correlated with their socioeconomic background. There are a number of studies which examine the socioeconomic determinants of age at first marriage in Third World nations. Many of these, e.g., Dixon (1971), Smith (1975a, 1975Z>, 1980), and Schultz (1980) are analyses for areas in which the mean age at marriage is correlated with other variables pertaining to the area. Only a few studies relate age at first marriage for individuals with other individual variables in a multivariate analysis. We shall summarize three such studies for Third World nations.
Balakrishnan (1976) studied the age at first marriage of women from four Latin American countries. He found that women's age at first marriage increased with the level of urbanization and education. Those with at least some secondary education married more than two years later than those with no education. Also, women who were raised in an urban area from early childhood married later.
Von Elm and Hirschman (1979) examined the socioeconomic determinants of the age at first marriage among women aged 25-44, in Peninsular Malaysia in 1966-1967. They found that age at first marriage was related to ethnicity differences and was positively associated with years of formal schooling, premarital work experience, urban origin, and having a nonfarm (particularly a white collar) father.
Lee (1982) also examined the determinants of age at first marriage in peninsular Malaysia but with a sample from a later year, 1974, and with a more elaborate path analysis. He found positive direct effects on age at first marriage of urban origin, educational level, premarital

work experience, and premarital work duration. However, the indirect effects of educational attainment on age atfirst marriage through premarital work status and premarital work duration were found to be very small.
There has also been some research on the determinants of age at menarche. Studies have documented a progressive lowering of the age at menarche in many societies, especially in the United States and Western Europe. Damon et al. (1969) have pointed out that since the nineteenth century, age of menarche has declined three or four months per decade, or about one year per generation in many Western societies. They concluded that the age at menarche is now 2.5 to 3.5 years earlier than it was a century ago. They argue that these changes are due to better nutrition, improved health conditions, and some asyet-unidentified aspects of the material and psychosocial environment (Damon et al., 1969).
There are also regional differences. Exploring the mean age of menarche in urban and rural areas of India, Madhavan (1965) found a difference of 1.40 years between urban and rural areas. In urban areas the mean age at menarche was 12.76 years, while that in rural areas was 14.16 years of age. Madhavan argues that socioeconomic conditions are usually better in urban areas, and therefore a discrepancy such as this often occurs in developing countries.
Frisch and Revelle (1970) hypothesized that menarche is dependent on the maintenance of a minimum weight for height representing a critical fat storage. Zacharias et al. (1976) reported a significant positive correlation between what they called the "ponderal index" (a

fonction of height and weight) and age at menarche. It was suggested that a woman's age at menarche is strongly associated with body build. Late menarche is related with thinness and early menarche with heaviness.
From a review of the literature, all of the studies of women's age at first marriage are seen to focus either on the effect of biological factors or on the influence of the socioeconomic realities in the lives of women, but none focuses on both biological and sociological factors simultaneously. As the previous research efforts have shown, both socioeconomic background and age at menarche are related to age at marriage. It is clearly important to consider both socioeconomic and biological influences on the age of women at first marriage. This is the basic purpose of this paper.
One important point to note is that when treating year of birth, urban residence, and educational attainment as indicators of modernization, negative indirect paths might be found between each of these variables and age at first marriage via age at menarche. In other words, modernization might tend to lower age at menarche and thus indirectly lower the age at first marriage as well. This indirect path from modernization to age at first marriage via age at menarche might counteract, at least in part, a direct positive path between modernization and age at first marriage.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data for this paper are drawn from Heer and Wu's 1969-1970 Taiwan survey, which was purposely designed for assessing the effects of infant and child mortality and preference for sons upon fertility and family planning behavior

and attitudes in Taiwan (Heer and Wu, 1975). The interviewing was conducted in two small townships near Taipei city: Kungliao and Hsinchuang. The former is a small fishing area of about 19,000 inhabitants. Most of the employed men are fishermen. The latter is an urbanizing factory area with about 43,000 inhabitants, and most of the employed men are farmers or factory workers. Kungliao was selected for the study because it had a very high level of infant and child mortality, while Hsinchuang was selected because it had a very low level of infant and child mortality. Additionally, Hsinchuang rated higher on all measures of modernization than Kugliao.
About 5,707 married women who had ever-married but had married only once were included in this study. Among them, those who lived in Kungliao in the time of survey are here classified as rural residents, while those who lived in Hsinchuang are treated as urban residents.
As mentioned before, this study focuses on the social and biological causes of women's age at first marriage. Five independent variables are used: Age (AGE) is defined in single years by subtracting the birth date from the survey date. Age at menarche (AAM) refers to the age at which the woman reported she began menstruating and is defined in single years. There may be some question about the accuracy of the age recorded for the age at menarche, because this was given retrospectively. However, according to Livson and McNeill's panel study of 43 American women who were born in the late 1920's, it is shown that, for this specific information, there is only a 0.50 year variation between the actual age at menarche and the recalled

age (Livson and McNeil], 1962). Educational attainment (ED) is measured in single years of schooling.
Premarital labor force participation (PMLFP) is based on response to the questions: "Have you ever taken a job outside the home either before or after marriage? If so, do you presently have a job outside the home?" It was coded as 0 if the answer was "never" and 1otherwise. Although the questions is ambiguous regarding time (previous means before marriage or earlier in the marriage), the researchers concluded that since the cultural restrictions regarding female labor force participation after marriage in Taiwan are so strong almost all previous employment occurred before marriage. Hence, there would be only a slight discrepancy between a positive answer to the question and actual premarital labor force participation.
Urban vs rural residence (RES) was coded according to residence at the time of responding to the questionnaire. Based on the level of urbanization, Kungliao was classified as a rural area and was coded as 0, while Hsingchuang was classified as an urban area and was coded as 1.
On the basis of previous studies, the following hypotheses are posed:
1. There will be a positive direct path to age at first marriage from the variables of age at menarche, premarital labor force participation, educational attainment, and urban residence. There will also be a negative direct path between current age and age at first marriage. This last negative path will translate into a positive path of equal magnitude between year of birth and age at first marriage.
2. There will be a negative direct path

to age at menarche from the variables of educational attainment and urban residence. There will also be a positive direct path from current age to age at menarche which translates into a negative direct path of equal magnitude from year of birth to age at menarche.
3. There will be a negative direct path to premarital labor force participation from the variables of current age and urban residence. There will be a positive direct path from educational attainment to premarital labor force participation.
4. There will be a negative direct path from current age and urban residence to educational attainment.
Since age at menarche itself may be affected by social factors, a path analysis is undertaken to see how thesefiveindependent variables interrelate to determine women's age at first marriage. In this model, women's age at menarche is determined by age cohort, residence, and educational attainment (which is treated as an important index of socioeconomic status). Premarital labor force participation is decided by educational attainment, age, cohort, and residence. While educational attainment itself may be influenced by several factors, in this model only age and residence are considered.
Another matter which should be explained here is that in the path diagram, there is a direct negative path between education and age at menarche. This does not mean that the effect of more education is earlier menarche. However, it does mean that high socioeconomic status is hypothesized to cause early menarche and that educational attainment is used here as an index of socioeconomic status in the family of origin. Admittedly, causation might run the other way if education is the alterna-

who would eventually marry were excluded from the survey. This reduced the mean age at first marriage for this age group.
As shown in Table 4, women with more than 12 years of schooling (with a mean age at first marriage of 22.86 years) tend to marry approximately 10 months later than those with 10 to 12 years of schooling, some 1.87 years later than those with 7 to 9 years of schooling, about 2.89 years later than those with 1 to 6 years of schooling, and about 4.00 years later than those with less than 1 year of schooling.

per cent of them had previous work experience. The mean age at first marriage for this group (20.61) is 1.54 years later than those who had never worked (19.07).
In this study, one of the most interesting findings is the relationship of age at menarche to age at marriage. Given the positive correlation coefficient of 0.11, a linear model shows the age at first mar-

riage increases when the age of menarche goes up.
As shown in Table 6, there is about 3.0 years difference in age at first marriage between those who menstruated at ages 12 to 15 years and those who menstruated after 20 years of age, with a mean age at first marriage of 20.26 years old for the latter group. Nevertheless, women who have their first menarche

under age 12marry later than those who first menstruated at 12 to 19 years old. This exception could be merely the result of sampling error (the number of cases is very small) or due to the effects of age, residence, and education. As mentioned before, younger generation females tend to have their menarche earlier, yet they tend to marry later than older generation females. Similarly, urban women who have their menarche at an earlier age also tend to marry later than their rural counterparts. The same is true for highly educated females. Those latter represent, generally, a higher socioeconomic status. They tend to have earlier menarche, yet they also marry at a later age.
The results for the postulated model are shown in Figure 1. Table 7 presents a more complete description of the results, including both unstandardized and standardized regression coefficients and the values of R2 for each equation. As shown in Table 7, the multiple regression on the dependent variable, age at first marriage, using the five indepen-

dent variables yields an R2 of 0.1821. That is, about 18per cent of the variance in age at first marriage is accounted for by age, urban vs. rural residence, educational attainment, premarital work experience, and age at menarche.
Relative to other determinants, age at menarche appears to have the greatest direct impact on age at marriage (Beta = 0.240). The others in order of variable strength are urban vs. rural residence (Beta = 0.218); educational attainment (Beta = 0.209); premarital work experience (Beta = 0.097); and age (Beta= -0.045). In other words, at least before 1970 in Taiwan, age at menarche had the most dominant effect on the variation of age at first marriage, whereas cohort membership exerted the smallest effect.
The minimal effect of cohort membership suggests that in spite of the economic growth experienced by the Taiwanese, the cultural attitudes in Taiwan remain traditional. The values embraced by a majority of the people, men and women alike, were that the woman

is, essentially, a childbearer and childraiser. These functions, along with service to her husband and subservience to her mother-in-law, formed her contribution to society (Wolf, 1972). According to traditional Chinese culture patterns, a Chinese woman lives with her husband in the home of his family of origin upon marriage. The appearance of menarche is a clear indication that a woman is prepared to assume her childbearing role. Her socialization within her family of origin should assume that she is prepared to be a mother and an

otherwise dutiful wife and daughter-inlaw.
Formal education for women is not considered valuable in such traditional Chinese societies. It is the mother's task to socialize her daughters to be good wives and mothers and dutiful daughters-in-law. The data themselves emphasize the low priority of education for women since the mean number of years of schooling for the women in the total sample is 3.54 years (for urban women, 4.54 years; and for rural women, 1.80 years). In fact, traditional

Chinese ideology affirms that "ignorance is a virtue for women". To have an educated wife sometimes does not provide happiness for her husband because a knowledgeable wife has too many ideas of her own. Such a woman is hard "to control," according to traditional Chinese thought. It should be noted that urban women have more than twice as much education as rural women, so that the traditional Chinese wisdom regarding women is slowly giving way to modernization.
As shown in Figure 1, premarital labor force participation is directly influenced by age, residence, and education. The path correlation coefficients are -0.182, 0.295, and 0.283, respectively. That is, older women rarely worked before marriage. The same is true for the rural women, while welleducated women tended to have premarital work experience. Education, as Figure 1 shows, is directly influenced by age and residence, the path correlation coefficients are --0.376 and 0.345, respectively. This may be interpreted to mean that older women and rural women are usually less well educated.
Age at menarche, as Figure 1 shows, is influenced by age, residence, and educational attainment (which is the index of socioeconomic status). The path coefficients are 0.108, -0.156, and -0.167, respectively. These coefficients imply that young urban females with high educational attainment tend to have menarche at an earlier age. However, young age, urban residence, and high educational attainment are all indicators of modernization. In other words, modernization tends to lower the age at menarche.
The positive direct path between age at menarche and age at first marriage

implies that females with earlier menarche tend to marry earlier. Accordingly, we have shown that modernization variables have a negative indirect path to age at first marriage via age at menarche.
CONCLUSION
In the past, social factors determining age at first marriage have been emphasized. Age at menarche has been given less attention. The Taiwanese data analyzed has been given less attention. The Taiwanese data analyzed in this study show the significance of this biological variable asa predictor of age at first marriage for women.
The data analysis indicates that this biological factor is interrelated with socioeconomic influences as predictors of age at first marriage. Older cohorts of women tended to marry about two years earlier than did the women below 30 years old considered in this study. The mean age at first marriage for urban women is 1.76 years later than that for rural women. There is a steadily increasing age at marriage as educational levels for women increase. There is a four year differential in age at first marriage between those who have no formal education and those who have completed at least 12 years of schooling. Similarly, women who worked before marriage married later than those who had never worked (20.61 years of age and 19.07 years of age, respectively).
A study such as this reemphasizes that in Taiwan, as elsewhere, there is a complex interplay of socioeconomic, and biological factors embedded within a cultural context which influences age at first marriage for females. This is particularly true in societies in developmen-
