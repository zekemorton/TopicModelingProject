The purpose of this paper is to specify what this writer sees as criteria which any policy aimed at zero population growth in the United States must meet, to critically assess a potentially effective program of payments to women for limiting their fertility, and to estimate the cost of such a program. The criteria specified presuppose that the only feasible policies are those which are acceptable in terms of the prevailing social norms and values. Thus, con-

United States is the middle- and upperclass, not the lower class.1 Secondly, children born to middle- and upper-class parents have a greater chance of filling middle- and upper-class occupations as adults than lower-class children; thus, to the extent that middle- and upper-class couples have large numbers of children, the amount of possible upward social mobility for lower-class children is reduced. Given the emphasis upon success in American society, a reduction in opportunities for upward social mobility will generate serious strains in a society already possessing a substantial "poverty problem," particularly since automation will continue to eliminate lower class jobs and may eliminate middle-class jobs as well.
Criterion 2 aims at maintaining the population at a replacement level. Although much can be said in favor of a program designed to reduce the size of the U.S. population, a formal goal of two children per woman would probably result in a leveling out of population size, with neither growth nor decline in numbers. This is because, given the current desire for two or more children by nine out of ten American wives (Whelpton, Campbell, and Patterson, 1966, p . 38), the program will probably lead to two children among virtually all wives, with the number of illegitimate births and women exceeding two children being suffi-
1 " . . . there seems little doubt that the rise in fertility in the United States [and, hence, the growth of population since World War II] has been caused more by the preference for larger families among those who consciously choose the number of children they have than by the high fertility in the impoverished segments of the population" (National Academy of Sciences, 1965, p. 6). That the middle and upper classes are the primary source of population growth stems from two conditions. First, the vast majority of families are middle or upper class; in 1967, three-fourths of all families, and four-fifths of families whose head was under 45 years of age, reported an income of at least $5,000 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1969). Second, at least among whites, who constitute an overwhelming majority of the population, fertility differentials by income are not only small and shrinking but "appear to be rapidly working toward a direct association between fertility and socio-economic status" (Bogue, 1969, p. 720; see also Cho, 1968; Whelpton et al., 1966, p. 103).

dent to bring births up to the replacement level.
Criterion 3 is perhaps the most controversial. It can be argued that the longer a child is delayed, the less motivation there is to have the child and that, therefore, a program to encourage a maximum of two children per woman might be necessary only until the woman reached age 30 or 35 and would still be successful in preventing the birth of a third child. While it is probably true at the present time that motivation for additional children declines with age, it is a distinct possibility that the cessation of the program at age 30 or 35 would simply cause women to have their third child after they had passed out of the age range subject to the program. This appears especially likely in view of the 1960 GAF study finding that 57% of the wives wanted to have at least three children (Whelpton, Campbell, and Patterson, 1966, p. 38). It must also be kept in mind that the majority of couples are capable of having children through their thirties. The 1960 GAF study reported that 75% of the couples in which the wife was 30-34 and 6 1 % of the couples in which the wife was 35-39 were fecund or possibly fecund, and these percentages would be larger if the couples made sterile through surgery undergone for contraceptive reasons while the wife was in her twenties decided against such surgery until they were out of the age range subject to the program and could complete their desired family size (see Whelpton et al., Table 80, p . 135, and Table 93, p. 161). Thus, a program ending when the wife attained her thirtieth or thirty-fifth birthday carries the possibility that there would be a large number of third births among women just out of the program, a number large enough to generate substantial population growth. It is the writer's feeling that the implications of continued population expansion are sufficiently serious that the inducement to have no more than two

children should not cease while the woman is still fecund.
Criterion 4 was listed because, from the perspective of reducing the volume of births, it would be self-defeating to develop a program which in any way would provide an incentive for having children. If a system of payments for fertility limitation was inaugurated, the payments should not, for instance, be limited to women with two children (with payments stopped if a third child was born); for a woman with just one child, the prospect of payments by having a second child could serve as a motivation to have that second child. Similarly, if a system of taxing couples with three or more children was developed in conjunction with continued dependents' deductions for couples with two or fewer children, there should not be any substantial differences in the amount of the deduction allowed for each dependent (e.g., an appreciably larger deduction for a second child than for the first child).
POSSIBLE POPULATION POLICIES
There appear to be two possible types of population policies which focus on motivating couples to want to have no more than two children and which meet at least the first four critera--a system of payments for not having more than two births and a system of taxes for having three or more. Because the latter is defined as "punitive" at the present time, payments would seem to be the more acceptable. This brings us to the last criterion, for a system of payments involves government expenditures and thus must be evaluated in terms of its financial feasibility.
A program of payments which would be consistent with the first four criteria would involve payments constituting a given percentage of the income of the recipient, the payments to be given to the couple from the time of their marriage through the end of the woman's childbearing period so long as she had no more than two live births. If a

family with one or two children experienced divorce or the death of one parent, payments would continue to the spouse raising the offspring.
Such payments, being a percentage of income, would presumably constitute as strong a motivation for fertility limitation in the middle- and upper-classes as in the lower class. The payments would provide a consistent motivation throughout the childbearing period by responding to increases in income. A couple would not be penalized for remaining childless or for having just a single child; there is thus no incentive from the program for having children. Finally, even though couples with high incomes (e.g., $20,000+) would receive substantial payments, which would be inconsistent with the goal of a more equal distribution of wealth, the program would probably be acceptable, especially since an upper limit could be imposed on the payments (e.g., $1,000 to $1,500 annually).
However, there are two potentially serious problems in such a program. First, as with any system of payments, a couple could use the payments to build up their assets to a level where they could afford to give up the payments and have another child. This could be a serious problem, since approximately one out of four wives expect to have fewer children than they want to have and the economic burden the additional offspring would impose is by far the most important reason given for the number expected being smaller than the number wanted (Whelpton et al., 1966, p. 53, 55) .2 Second, the total cost of the program might make it economically, and hence politically, unfeasible. The possible cost of such a
2 Whelpton et al. (1966, p. 93) report that Protestant wives are more likely than Catholic wives to expect fewer children than desired because of the economic factor, leading one to predict that Protestants would be more likely to use the payments for another birth than Catholics. Judith Blake (19676), on the other hand, would apparently argue that Catholics are more likely than Protestants to use the payments for another birth.

242

program should be estimated, for the writer feels that a program approximating the above needs to be seriously considered. The cost will be estimated for 1975 and 1985, since it is likely that a program of payments would begin no earlier than 1975 and the cost of the program ten years after its inception should be considered in assessing its feasibility.
COST ESTIMATE FOR FAMILY LIMITATION PAYMENTS
Calculating the cost requires estimating (1) the distribution of income in 1975 and 1985 and (2) the number of eligible recipients at each income level in these two years. The latter estimate requires the use of "primary families," as denned by the Census Bureau. A "primary family" comprises the head of a household and all household members related to him or her by blood, marriage, or adoption (as opposed to a "secondary family," whose members are not related to the head of the household in which it resides). A primary family may contain a subfamily, for example, a married couple or parent-child group sharing the living quarters of the family head. On the one hand, using primary families to calculate the number of eligible recipients tends to underestimate that number, since subfamilies would be eligible unless they resulted from an illegitimate birth. On the other hand, not all primary families with two or fewer births would be eligible for payments; those formed via an illegitimate birth would be ineligible until the mother married. (Illegitimate births placed for adoption would not create a primary family or subfamily.) It is impossible to know exactly how these opposing influences affect the estimate of the number of eligible recipients; presumably, their effects will be roughly counterbalancing.
In order to estimate the changed income distribution--i.e., the higher income level--

that is likely to prevail in 1975 and 1985, the mean annual percentage-point change between 1962 and 1966 was computed for families within each bracket of total money income. The mean change was calculated separately for families whose head was under 25 years of age, 25-34 years of age, and 35-44 years of age. Within each age-ofhead grouping, the mean change was calculated for each of fifteen income brackets, from "under $1,000" to "$25,000+." Using the 1966 distribution of families by total money income within each age-of-head grouping, the mean 1962-66 annual change was applied until 1975 and 1985 in order to obtain the distribution of families by total money income in those years (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1963, 1964, 1965, 1967a, b).3 The procedure yielded distributions totaling more than 100%, and the percentages within each distribution were reduced by the fraction required to make their sum equal to 100%.
Next, the projected percentage distributions of families by total money income according to age of head were applied to the Census Bureau's low projections of number of primary families within each age-of-head category for 1975 and 1985 in order to estimate the number of primary families in each income bracket within each age-of-head grouping in 1975 and 1985 (U.S. Bureau of
3 The years 1962-66 were used because they were the only ones for which income distributions of families were available by age of head at the time the projections were made. Using these years leads to the projection of a rapid rise in family income between 1966 and 1985, but the projection would seem justified. The period 1966-69 has probably seen an even more rapid increase in family income than 1962-66. Moreover, the years since World War II have generally been characterized by a rapid rise in income. Median family income in 1966 was approximately two-and-a-half times larger than in 1947 ($7,436 vs. $3,031); the proportion of families earning less than S3,000 declined from_49.4% in 1947 to 14.3% in 1966; and the proportion of families earning at least §10,000 increased from 2.7% in 1947 to 29.6% in 1966. There is no reason to anticipate the trend of the past two decades will not continue. Consequently, the 1962-66 period probably provides a reasonably accurate picture of income trends until 1985.

the Census, 1968).* (Using 44 years as the maximum age of head underestimates the number eligible for the payments, because among husband-wife primary families, which compose the vast majority of all primary families, wives are slightly more than two years younger on the average than their husbands, i.e., than the family head. Presumably payments would be made until the wife reached her forty-fifth birthday.) It should be noted that the income projections for 1975 and 1985 were in terms of the distribution of families, but were applied to the projected total number of primary families. However, 99.8% of all families in 1966 were primary families, and the same proportion was projected by the Census Bureau for 1975 and 1985 (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1968).
At this point in the calculations, estimates consisted of the number of primary families in each income bracket within each age-of-head grouping for 1975 and 1985. The next step was to estimate the proportion of primary families in 1975 with no more than two births, since payments in the program being considered would be limited to primary families having had no more than two births. For this estimate, the percentage distribution in 1967 by number of children ever born alive to women under 25, 25-34, and 35-44 were used. This assumes that the distribution in 1975 of primary families by number of children ever born will be virtually the same as the distribution in 1967 of women by number of children ever born. However, the 1967 distribution of women by number of children ever born probably underestimates the number of primary families eligible for payments in 1975, because women born since the late 1930's appear somewhat less likely to have three or more children than immediately preceding cohorts (Grabill and Davidson, 1968; Blake, 1967).
4 The high projections (Series 1) were above the projections used (Series 2) by 3.2% in 1975 and 3.8% in 1985.

In 1967, the proportion of women under 25 with no births, one birth, two births, and three or more births was 74.9%, 14.3%, 7.3%, and 3.5%, respectively. The respective proportions for women 25-34 were 14.7%, 16.0%, 26.2%, and 43.1%. The respective proportions for women 35-44 were 10.7%, 12.1%, 23.5%, and 53.7% (National Center for Health Statistics, 1968). Thus, in 1967, 96.5% of women under 25, 56.9% of women 25-34, and 46.3% of women 35-44 had had two births or less.
The number of primary families in all income brackets within each age-of-head grouping in 1975 was multiplied by the percentage of women with no more than two births in the appropriate comparable age grouping in order to obtain an estimate of the number of primary families with no more than two children in each income bracket in 1975. The same percentage was used for all income brackets within the particular age grouping; in other words, it was assumed that there would be no variations by income level in the proportion of families in a given age grouping with two or fewer births. The supposition was that the long-term trend reducing the inverse relationship between income and fertility will continue and that by 1975 the currently small income differentials in fertility will be completely and permanently eliminated within each age level.
The number of primary families eligible for the payments in each income level within each age-of-head grouping in 1985 was calculated on the assumption that the program of payments was completely effective, so that no woman in a primary family had more than two children after the start of the program in 1975. (This assumption undoubtedly overestimates to some extent the number of primary families who would be eligible for the payments in 1985). Thus, the percentage of primary families with two or fewer children among heads aged

under 25 in 1975 was used as the percentage of primary families with two or fewer children for heads aged 25-34 in 1985; similarly, the percentage of primary families with two or fewer children among heads aged 25-34 in 1975 was used as the percentage of primary families with two or fewer children for heads aged 35^44 in 1985. With

regard to primary families with a head under 25 years old in 1985, a completely effective program would result in none of these families having had more than two children.
Within each age-of-head grouping, the proportion of primary families in 1985 with two children or less was multiplied by the

total number of primary families in each income bracket, again with the assumption that there would be no fertility differences by income within each age level. This provided an estimate of the number of primary families in each income bracket with no more than two children in 1985.
The cost of the program of payments was calculated on the premise that the payments would have to be 5% of total money income to prevent the birth of more than two children. As a result, the midpoint of each income bracket was multiplied by 0.05, the product being multiplied in turn by the

number of families in the income bracket with no more than two children. The cost estimate for 1975 appears in Table 1; the cost estimate for 1985 appears in Table 2.
In 1975, the costs for the three age-ofhead groups total $9,334,520,561. In 1985, the costs for the three age-of-head groups total $18,407,164,575. Thus approximately nine billion dollars would be required in 1975 and eighteen billion dollars in 1985 to annually pay primary families 5% of their total money income not to have more than two children.

Thus, if one assumes 7.5% would be necessary to keep primary families from exceeding two children, the cost would be 7.5 -r- 5 = 1.5 X 9 billion dollars = 13.5 billion dollars in 1975; and 7.5 -i- 5 = 1.5 X 18 billion dollars = 27 billion dollars in 1985.
DISCUSSION
Assuming that the problem of couples "saving up" the payments (and then giving them up for a third birth) could be overcome, is a program of payments financially feasible? The writer thinks not. In order to be effective in preventing third births, an annual payment of no less than 5% of income would appear to be required. Given the necessity of spending what will probably amount to hundreds of billions of dollars over the next two or three decades for such programs as urban renewal, mass transportation, and cleaning up America's air and water supplies, and given the likelihood of continued large defense expenditures, it does not appear that nine billion dollars, let alone eighteen billion, will be allocated annually to pay women to have no more than two children.
It can be argued that such a program, by reducing the number of births, would pay for itself. While this is probably true, it must be kept in mind that the savings from fewer births is a long-term one. The savings essentially start five years after the birth is prevented, at the time when the child would have entered school, and continue over the next twelve to twenty years. Hypothetically, Americans could initially afford to pay higher tax rates to generate sufficient revenues both for a program of payments for fertility limitation and for the immediately needed programs to rebuild the cities and clean up the environment; but the actual chances of higher rates are remote since even current rates are generating a

"taxpayers' revolt." This "revolt," moreover, seems likely to involve substantial pressures to use the larger revenues to be derived from the future growth of the economy for reducing the current tax rates.
What is considerably more likely to be adopted--if the decision is made to halt domestic population growth quickly, efficiently, and fairly--is a tax on each birth a female has beginning with the third, the tax being a percentage of the adjusted gross income of the parents and paid each year until retirement. The tax, applying only to births which occur after the measure takes effect, would be computed on the basis of the combined income of both parents. The tax would obviously not be paid by women having had three or more births before the measure went into effect, although it would be paid by such women for each additional birth. While there would be some couples having a third birth from whom it would be difficult or impossible to collect the tax, so that the tax would have to be deferred or "written off," their number would undoubtedly be small, if not infinitesimal.
Third births could, at worst, be prevented through heavy reliance on surgical sterilization; however, by the mid-1970's, mechanical and especially chemical contraceptives should be far more effective than at present and thus unwanted children resulting from the use of such contraceptives should be rare, especially if a "morning after" pill is available or if surgical abortion is fully legalized. Even in 1960, when oral contraceptives were essentially not in use, the GAF survey found that no more than onefifth of the white wives in any age group had had more children than they wanted (Whelpton et al., 1966, p. 66), suggesting the high level of fertility control possible with less effective contraceptives than are now and will be available.
A tax on third and higher order births
would meet the five criteria specified earlier.

A tax that was a percentage of income would constitute as strong a motivation for fertility limitation in the middle and upper classes as in the lower class; it would motivate women to have no more than two births; it would continue at a high level throughout the entire childbearing period by automatically responding to increases in income; and it would not provide an incentive to bear children among those women inclined to have less than two births. With regard to the last of the criteria, the tax would certainly be financially feasible. It would not involve any governmental expenditures other than the very small amount required to collect information on natality, collate it via computer to identify women having had a third or higher order birth, and collect the tax from the presumably few couples who would have a third or higher order birth.
However, there is a serious question whether the tax would be acceptable to the public. In this regard, Berelson (1969, p. 5) points out that "positive" programs--those aimed at attaining other social goals besides population control--are more likely to be accepted than "negative" programs, those which aim solely at population control. Today, a tax would probably be viewed by most Americans as "negative" in nature and unacceptable. By the mid-1970's, however, a tax will probably be viewed as "positive." A major reason is that the currently substantial concern over environmental pollution and population density is almost certain to grow rapidly, and as this concern and the evidence supporting it are increasingly publicized, the American people will become highly cognizant of the immediate and serious threat to life and health posed by continued population growth. With the alternative to zero population growth being increased morbidity and mortality rates and increased social disintegration, a tax measure should come to be viewed as "posi-

tive." Since a tax would be consistent with American norms emphasizing and denning justice and with the value of efficiency, it is quite likely to be acceptable and workable.
Would a tax be effective in reducing family size? The answer would seem affirmative. The 1960 GAF survey found that, among fecund wives, the economic burden of children was the major reason given by 54% for not expecting a larger family than they anticipated actually having (Whelpton et al., 1966, p. 55), and this proportion will probably increase as the direct financial costs of a child rise. Moreover, to quote Judith Blake (1968, p. 19), "since children are 'purchased' on the installment plan, if the 'payments' are kept low, a major constraint on acquiring more is removed; if the payments are kept high, on the other hand, the impact of the costs involved may readily lead to a desire not to incur many more of a similar nature."5 Thus, a tax on third and higher order births could be reasonably expected to significantly reduce the probability of having more than two children.
However, unless alternative roles to motherhood and the indirect costs of children are increased substantially for women, the tax could easily generate such frustration that it would be ultimately repealed. That is to say, unless women can obtain rewards in ways other than by having large numbers of children, limiting the number of births via a tax measure is quite likely to prove unworkable over the long run. Women must have available and be motivated to pursue more schooling opportunities after high school, a greater number and variety of job possibilities, and more opportunities for volunteer and charitable work (perhaps work dealing with children). As Judith Blake
5 Donald Bogue's argument that "fertility declines need not be a generational real-cohort phenomena, but can take place suddenly as an across-allage group phenomena that bring about drastic reductions in fertility at all ages and all parities" (Bogue, 1969, p. 741) should be noted here.

(1965, p. 61) has argued, "a stabilized reduction in the[level of] family size desires . . . will require a significant lessening of involvement in familial roles. Otherwise, policy is bucking a motivational syndrome

that has a built-in 'righting reflex' inthe face of antinatalist blows."
