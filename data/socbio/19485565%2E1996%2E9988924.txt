ABSTRACT: Recent studies have demonstrated an increased occurrence of interracial marriages in the United States, indicating important shifts in intergroup relations. The effectiveness of traditional theoretical approaches in explaining who marries whom, however, remains problematic. Recently, exchange explanations (which have typically assumed that the black partner in the union exchanges educational and economic accomplishments for the higher "status" of the white spouse) have been replaced by progressive theories emphasizing a trend away from ascriptive and toward achievement norms. We extend this approach by predicting an economic and educational gap between spouses in interracial marriages when compared with racially homogamous marriages. Using the 1980 and 1990 Public Use Microdata Sample, we find continuing evidence that racial barriers in mate selection are weakening. Further, people who intermarry, regardless of race or gender, tend to have higher educational and economic status than those in homogamous marriages. There is still limited support for the kinds of social exchanges between spouses that were implied in earlier sociological theories. We conclude that (1) socioeconomic differentials are not always consistent with the exchange perspective and (2) that recent trends are not systematically eroding these socioeconomic differentials in mate selection.

Over half a century ago, Robert K. Merton (1941) observed that all societies develop a system of mate selection which serves to regulate who may marry whom. The incest taboo, which proscribes marriages between members of the same elementary family unit, is generally regarded as the definitive example. The practical application of this taboo requires the mate selection process to include only persons who are dissimilaron a prescribed set of criteria--in this instance, omitting those who are blood relatives. Marriage rules also specify that persons whose backgrounds are too dissimilar are less suitable mates, as well (Merton, 1941, p. 361). Generally, such rules have resulted in a preference for marriage partners with similar race, educational, family status, and age

characteristics. In practice, the outcome of these rules defining both who is and who is not an acceptable mate is a set of social norms that define some optimal level of difference. Such norms vary significantly from one society to another, depending upon culturallydetermined preferences and expectations.
Social science research on mate selection has often focused on patterns of interracial marriage within a given society, both because such patterns are an indicator of the nature of race relations and because they measure important social changes that may be occurring. In fact, patterns of interracial marriage were often considered a prototype indicator of intergroup relations earlier in this century and, as such, attracted substantial research attention

(see, for example, Bernard, 1966; Davis, 1941; Drachsler, 1921; Golden, 1953; Heer, 1966; Merton, 1941; Reuter, 1931; van den Berghe, 1960). For the last couple of decades, however, such research has been far less prominent, despite the fact that there has been increased attention devoted to the study of interracial comparisons on such topics as mortality and morbidity, income, employment, education, residence, and other basic demographic patterns (Kalmijn, 1993). More recently, several studies have addressed changing patterns in interracial marriage, treating these changes as an indicator of important shifts in intergroup relations (Kalmijn, 1993; Schoen and Wooldredge, 1989; Tucker and Mitchell-Kernan, 1990).
Theoretical explanations of changing marriage choices point to changes in the relative importance of achieved, as opposed to ascriptive, criteria in determining a variety of life choices and opportunities. This paper will build on recent work examining trends and patterns of interracial marriage between 1980 and 1990. First, we address the question of whether important tendencies observed by the above studies have continued. Second, we compare mean levels of education and income for husbands and wives in mixed and same-race marriages. Finally, we develop multivariate models predicting the likelihood of interracial marriage.
BACKGROUND
HISTORICAL PATTERNS
OF INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE
Historically, the occurrence of interracial marriages in the United States

has been very low. At the turn of the century, for example, studies conducted in several major cities found that less than 1 per cent of all black marriages involved a white spouse (cited in Kalmijn, 1993, p. 122). These rates changed very modestly over the next several decades. Glick (1970) notes, for example, that in 1960, only about four marriages out of every one thousand were interracial. Beginning in the 1960's, however, the pattern began to shift. Heer (1974) reports a 26 per cent increase in the number of black-white marriages during the decade of the 1960's, and this pattern of increasing rates has apparently continued to the present. Kalmijn (1993) observes that the percentage of black men outside the South who married a white woman was 3.9 per cent in 1968, but greater than 10 per cent by 1986. For black women outside the South, the increase was from 1.2 per cent to 3.7 per cent. Based on his findings, interracial marriages in the South between blacks and whites continue at a much lower rate, but even here important changes have occurred, especially in the number of black men who marry white women.
While increases have occurred for each combination (white husband/ black wife and black husband/white wife), current research on interracial marriages consistently indicates marriages involving a black male and a white female are more common. At the other end of the continuum, the least frequent pattern has been white men marrying black women. Heer (1974), in fact, found a modest decrease in the occurrence of this type of marriage for the decade between 1960 and 1970 and, while that may have now

reversed, previous research suggests that it remains the less acceptable combination.
A number of factors are probably important in understanding the increased occurrence of black/white marriages. Bound and Freeman (1989) note that with the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the development of a variety of other affirmative action programs, there was a substantial movement of young educated blacks into the mainstream of the American economy and the relative income of black workers began to rise sharply. The number of blacks who sought advanced educational opportunities also increased, thus narrowing, at least for a time, the racial gap in education. These factors may have created increased opportunities for black/ white contact in more status-equal situations, increasing, in turn, opportunities for social interaction and marriage. It is important to note, however, that a weaker economy, combined with a changing political environment during the Reagan-Bush era, caused the rate of black economic progress to slow dramatically and seems also to have affected the number of blacks seeking advanced education (Bound and Freeman, 1989). Nevertheless, available data indicate that patterns of increased occurrence of black/white marriages continue, suggesting the importance of non-economic factors in the selection process.
Perhaps of greater importance than changes in economic circumstances have been changes in white prejudice toward blacks (Feagin, 1991;Schuman, Steeh, and Bobo, 1985). Firebaugh and Davis (1988), for example, note significant decreases in the occurrence

of antiblack prejudice. Three major findings emerge from their research: (1) antiblack prejudice as measured by questions in the General Social Survey has declined steadily in recent years; (2) the decline stems in significant part from cohort replacement (the replacement of older, more prejudiced cohorts with younger, less prejudiced ones), as well as from attitude change itself; and (3) though absolute levels of antiblack prejudice remain significantly higher in the South, prejudice is declining more rapidly in the South, resulting in shrinking regional differences. Each of these factors suggest that socially prescribed norms have changed quite significantly.
We must also note elimination of the proscription on certain out-group marriages that was institutionalized into law in a number of states in this country. While there were some differences from one state to another, the general intent of these laws was to bar the marriage of persons of color to whites. In 1967, the United States Supreme Court, in Loving vs. Virginia, found such laws unconstitutional. While the timing of this decision is consistent with the major upturn in interracial marriages, there is little evidence suggesting that this formal deinstitutionalization has been a major factor in affecting actual practice. Instead, both the challenge of state miscegenation laws and the increase in interracial marriages probably reflect changes in attitudes and socially prescribed norms on mate selection.
THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES
ON MATE SELECTION
Much prior work relies heavily on an exchange perspective and argues

206

Heaton and Albrecht

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:47 08 December 2015

that each partner in the union is trading something of value to the other in exchange for something they value in return. In the non-interracial union, for example, it was often argued that women sought men who had college educations or who exhibited good earning potential, while men were primarily concerned with finding a physically attractive mate or one who could provide other domestic and social advantages (Bersheid and Walster, 1974; Buss, 1985). Thus, males "exchanged" economic advantage for the desired value of physical attractiveness or domestic skill. Applied to black/white marriages, the theory suggests two types of socioeconomic differences. People who marry someone of a different race will have distinctive socioeconomic characteristics both in comparison to their spouse and to persons of the same race who marry endogamously. For example, black men who marry white women will have higher educational and economic positions relative to other black men, as well as relative to their white brides. Thus, white women "exchange" the social status that comes with their race for the economic security of successful black men (Schoen and Wooldredge, 1989). This model assumes that being black is a devalued trait that must be compensated for with some other social or economic advantage.
The notion that spouses exchange other types of status for racial advantage or disadvantage, initially advanced by Merton (1941) and Davis (1941), has been highly controversial, despite its general popularity. Bernard (1966), for example, found no significant proclivity for wives of black males to be of relatively lower educational attainment if white than if black. Neither

did she find any evidence that black females had husbands with relatively lower educational attainment if white than if black. It is important to note, however, that Bernard's work does not address the issue of whether or not black males with relatively high statuses were more likely to have white wives than black males with relatively lower statuses.
Monahan (1976) also challenged the Merton-Davis thesis. His work found no distinguishable degree of "marrying up" or "marrying down" in black/ white unions. In fact, a case by case comparison of relative occupational position of husband and wife indicated a strong preference for equality. When there was a difference, more often both white men and white women married a black of lower occupational status. Burma, Cretser, and Seacrest (1970), similarly found no significant difference in the proportion of intermarrying and intramarrying couples having approximately the same occupational status levels.
Three recent studies, however, have provided some empirical support for the earlier thesis. Tucker and MitchellKernan (1990), using data from marriages in Los Angeles County, found that black men who married white women were more likely to be employed, had higher incomes, were older, and were older at age of first marriage. Using data from Virginia and North Carolina, Schoen and Wooldredge (1989) found that in mixed race marriages, departures from homogamy were more likely to involve white females marrying better educated black males. They conclude that "the observed departures from homogamy could generally be interpreted as reflecting the female's greater emphasis

Vol. 43, No. 3-4

on the male's economic status, the male's greater emphasis on the female's social status, or both" (Schoen and Wooldredge 1989, p. 478). That white women would be more likely to marry black men of higher status would clearly fit the long held notion of women "marrying up." Finally, Kalmijn (1993, p. 142), in a study of black/ white intermarriage from marriage license data for 33 states between 1968 and 1986, concluded that when black men marry white women, "these unions tend to involve high status black males and lower status white females. Moreover, the tendency for white women to be upwardly mobile in mixed marriages has remained fairly stable in the last two decades. It seems that even though the extent of boundary crossing has become more common, the nature of these marriages has remained traditional in the sense that racial caste prestige and socioeconomic prestige still function as substitutes in the selection process."
An increasingly important shift in mate selection patterns may be underway in this country, however, and this shift may have substantial implications both for the frequency of black/white marriages and for efforts to explain their occurrence. Kalmijn (1991) describes this as a shift from ascription to achievement in marriage selection and notes that it is consistent with other important stratification-related changes. For example, theorists on stratification are now arguing that ascriptive criteria such as class background and race are less important in determining life chances than are achieved qualities, such as educational attainment (Featherman and Hauser, 1978). Kalmijn's analysis of mate selection patterns shows that education (de-

fined as an achieved status) is now a more important boundary in marriage selection than social-class origin (an ascribed status) and that educational homogamy in marriage has increased over time. A recognition of the increased importance of achieved statuses in mate selection also addresses, at least indirectly, an important weakness of the initial Merton/Davis thesis: its failure to give adequate attention to the availability of partners by race and by educational attainment. As we have seen from recent empirical findings, increased opportunities for interracial contact, particularly in more statusequal settings, increases the probability of interracial marriage, an idea that was clearly underdeveloped in the initial exchange formulation.
Applied to interracial marriage, this model suggests an increased importance of similarity in achieved statuses (such as education and income) and less importance of similarity in ascribed statuses (such as race). Thus, the frequency of interracial marriages would increase while differences in achieved statuses of partners in interracial marriages would decrease. Furthermore, while social exchange theories may still have some importance, the nature of the things "exchanged" will have shifted. For example, rather than one partner (a black male, in this instance) exchanging higher educational and income attainment for the social status associated with marrying a white female, both will place greater value on commonly valued goods (such as educational attainment), resulting in greater marital homogamy on these achieved criteria.
In summary, exchange theory models of marriage propose that black race is viewed as a negative trait and must

208

be compensated for by the presence of other valued characteristics. Thus, blacks who marry whites are expected to have above average SES, while the reverse would be the case for whites who marry blacks. However, recent trends in marriage patterns suggest a decline in the importance of ascriptive traits (such as social class background and race) and an increase in the importance of achieved status (education and income). Evidence that interracial marriage is increasing and that negative attitudes toward such unions are decreasing would support this general contention, as would findings of increased homogamy on major achieved statuses among partners in interracial marriages.
To address recent trends in mate selection, we derive four research hypotheses:
1. Consistent with recent trends reported in the literature, we predict increased rates of interracial marriage over the decade 1980-90.
2. According to exchange theory, whites who marry blacks will have lower status than other whites, but blacks in interracial marriages will have higher status than other blacks.
3. As women are more concerned with the socioeconomic status of their spouse than are men, the tendency to marry up will be particularly evident for white women who marry black men.
4. Because of social trends reducing barriers against interracial marriage, the differences in #2 and #3 will decline over the decade from 1980 to 1990.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data for this analysis are taken from the 1980 and 1990 Public Use Micro-

data Sample (PUMS). All married persons with spouse present were selected from the 1 per cent sample, and husbands and wives were matched. Because the resulting file was large (over one million married couples) we sampled 10 per cent of the most common type of marriage--those between white non-Hispanic husbands and wives. Analysis will focus on four groups defined by husband's and wife's race (white or black). Hispanics and all other races are excluded from the analysis.
Most recent studies of interracial marriage rely on information from marriage certificates. This source of data has certain advantages. Information is recorded at the time of the marriage and all legal marriages are included for reporting states, but not all states report. In the most comprehensive study, only 33 states were included (Kalmijn, 1993). In comparison, census data does not include information on marriage date in 1990 or on race of spouse in marriages that have been terminated. The main advantages of census data are geographic coverage and breadth of information.
Lack of information on terminated marriages in census data is not a fatal problem for two reasons. First, exchange models used to predict marital choice can also be applied to marital stability such that complementary hypotheses can be used to explain the dual processes of choice and permanence that lead to prevalence of given marriage patterns in cross-sectional data. Second, the percentage of interracial marriages reported in crosssectional data more accurately reflects contemporary marriage structures than does data on rate of occurrence. Census data are also preferable because

they allow the distinction between Hispanic and non-Hispanic groups. Exclusion of Hispanics eliminates the potentially confounding influence of marriages between blacks and Hispanics. Finally, census data include information on income. Although education is certainly an important measure of socioeconomic status, it is only one indicator. Income is a better indicator of standard of living and may be at least as important as education in mate selection. Unfortunately, income is reported for the year prior to the census, and no information is available about income at the time of marriage. We assume that current income is correlated with potential income at the time of marriage and reflects economic characteristics that cannot be measured solely by education.
We will first analyze marriages including all age groups. Then, to focus attention on the most recent trends, we will conduct a comparable analysis for married couples where each spouse is age thirty or younger. Sample sizes are reported in Table 1.
In order to compare the status of those in homogamous and heterogamous marriages, we compare mean values of education and earnings for husbands and wives in each type of marriage. Then, to examine the probability of an interracial marriage by levels of these characteristics, we estimate binomial logistic regression models predicting the likelihood of interracial marriage. Although other methods are better able than logistic regression to take into account racial and sexual differences in the distributions of education and income (Kalmijn, 1991, 1993; Schoen and Wooldredge, 1989), these methods become unwieldy when

multiple independent variables are included. Age is included as a control variable. Recognizing important regional differences in the pattern of interracial marriage, a dummy variable is included for residence in the south. Earnings in 1980 are adjusted for inflation to match 1990 values. Education variables are recoded to adjust for differences in coding in the two censuses. Exact comparability between the two decades is impossible, but is not essential to our analysis. To create approximate comparability, years of schooling in 1980 is reduced by 1 if the grade was not completed and responses in each census are recoded into similar categories that reflect years of schooling completed.
RESULTS
Our results demonstrate that the pattern of increased frequency of interracial marriage reported in the literature continues through the decade of the 1980's. Heer (1974) reports that 0.8 per cent of black males were married to white women in 1960, increasing to 1.2 per cent in 1970. According to our data, this percentage increased to 2.6 in 1980 and 4.2 in 1990. The trend appears less dramatic if we calculate the percentage of white women married to black men. Heer (1974) reports 0.07 per cent in 1960, and 0.1 per cent in 1970, increasing in our data to 0.22 per cent in 1980 and 0.29 per cent in 1990. Comparing the same two data sources, the percentage of black females married to white males decreased from 0.8 per cent in 1960 to 0.7 per cent in 1970, did not change in 1980, and then increased to 1.5 per cent in 1990. Likewise, the percentage of white males

married to black females dropped from 0.07 in 1960 to 0.06 in 1970, did not change in 1980, and increased to 0.1 in 1990.
Table 2 shows the odds of an interracial marriage based on matched husbands and wives in the 1980 and 1990 censuses. Two prominent patterns are evident in these data. First, as would be expected given relative sizes of the two groups, each interracial marriage involves a larger proportion of blacks than whites. Second, marriages between black men and white women are more than three times as common as marriages between black women and white men.
Clearly, the rise in interracial marriage continues to be reflected in the most recent data. The least common marriages--white husband and black wife--have experienced the greatest increase, doubling in the ten-year interval. Marriages between white women and black men have also increased by about 60 per cent. These rather dramatic relative increases in interracial marriages represent only slight increases in the actual per cent of interracial marriages, however. For example, if marriages were strictly color blind, the odds that a white man would

be married to a black woman rather than a white woman would be 0.079 in 1990. The observed odds in 1980 of 0.0006 would need to increase by about 132 times to reach the odds of 0.079 representing random marriage in 1990, but it only increases by a factor of about two. Thus, the change occurring in the 1980's narrowed the gap between the 1980 pattern of homogamous marriage among white males and the hypothetical model of random marriage by oiily about 1.5 per cent (2/132 = 0.015). Results for younger couples show a higher likelihood of interracial marriage, slightly greater increases in white-male-black-female marriages, and slightly smaller increases in white-female-black-male marriages.
Table 3 compares the mean education and earnings of spouses in each type of marriage. Long-standing socioeconomic differences by race and gender are evident in these data. Beyond these inequalities, the most striking pattern is that spouses in interracial marriages have higher status than do spouses of the same race in homogamous marriages. Higher education is observed in interracial marriages, for the total and the young cohort, for

men and women, and for both races, the only exception being white females married to black males aged 30 or younger in 1980. Income is higher in interracial than in same race marriages in each case except those involving white women and black men. While this pattern has been observed previously for the education of black males marrying white females (Kalmijn, 1993), its tendency across decades, genders, age groups, races, and measures of status gives it greater importance.
The exchange model implies relatively large status differences between black husbands and white wives because the men must have high socioeconomic status to be attractive. In contrast, there should be a smaller difference between white husbands and black wives because the man's status would be relatively low while the reverse would be the case for the wives. Spouse differences in interracial marriages reported in Table 3 are consistent with this prediction. Both the education and income gaps between

husband and wife are larger in blackhusband-white-wife marriages than in white-husband-black-wife marriages. Income gaps tend to be largest, however, in white-white marriages. Education differences tend to favor the wife, and income gaps are smallest in blackblack marriages. Because of the relatively high status of partners in interracial marriages in comparison with same race marriages the exchange model does not adequately predict spouses' socioeconomic differences in these marriages.
In order to sort out influences of gender, race, and type of marriage, means in Table 3 were subjected to further analysis. Regression equations were estimated predicting income and education with sex, race, a race-sex interaction, and a dummy variable for interracial marriage. Results are presented in Table 4.
The first two rows of Table 4 show the coefficients for interracial marriage which is the average difference in status of people in heterogamous andhomogamous marriages after controlling

for race and sex. As is clear from Table 4, interracial marriages are marked by higher status. Furthermore, three of the four comparisons indicate the status advantage has increased rather than decreased over the decade.
The remainder of Table 4 reports residuals after removing the average effects of race, gender, and type of marriage. Once these effects are removed, education differences are generally consistent with predictions of exchange

theory. Whites who marry blacks tend to have relatively low educational status while the reverse is true of blacks who marry whites. As exchange theory also predicts, status effects are greater for marriages between black men and white women than for marriages between white men and black women in the total sample, but not for those under age 30.
Patterns for income are less consistent than those for education. In the

total sample, white men who marry black women have relatively low incomes, but younger men in 1990 are an exception. Black women who marry white men do have relatively high incomes in three of the four comparisons. No single pattern describes marriages between black men and white women. In the total sample, black men married to white women have relatively high earnings, but the same is not true for the younger cohort. Contrary to exchange theory predictions, white women who marry black men tend to have relatively high incomes, but the young cohort in 1990 is an exception. Because of small sample sizes and inconsistent results, income differences in this case should be treated with caution. It seems clear, however, that income differences do not necessarily mimic education differences. Thus, it is

not safe to assume that education alone provides a complete accounting of status differences.
Results show no consistent support for the hypothesis that status differentials are decreasing over time. Indeed, several of the values presented in Table 4 are larger in 1990 than in 1980. It would appear from this that status considerations in mate selection may be as important in 1990 as they were in 1980.
Table 5 shows results of the logistic regressions predicting the odds of interracial marriage. Interracial marriages are less common in the south than in the remainder of the country, with the single exception of the percentage of white women aged thirty or less in 1990 married to black men. While previous research has documented the much lower likelihood of black/white marriages in the south,

attitudinal studies have shown that antiblack prejudice has been declining more rapidly here than in other areas of the country (Firebaugh and Davis, 1988). Apparently, an important lag remains between attitudinal change and changes in practices such as mate selection. Perhaps there will be a more rapid rate of change in the south in the future as behavioral changes catch up with the liberalization of attitudes. Overall, the probability of interracial marriage decreases sharply with age, and most of the decrease is probably because of recent increases in interracial marriage.
Consistent with our finding that spouses in interracial marriages tend to have higher status, logistic regression results indicate that the likelihood of interracial marriage tends to increase with education. The only exception to this pattern is among white women, but three of the four coefficients are not statistically significant. Comparison of education coefficients across gender and race does support the exchange perspective. Higher educational attainment is much more important for black men marrying white women than for white women who marry black men. Education coefficients for black women marrying white men are only slightly higher than for white men marrying black women in the total sample, but differences are greater in the thirty and under sample. The fact that these differences in education coefficients are greater when comparing white women and black men than when comparing white men and black women also supports the notion that marrying up is particularly important for white women who marry interracially. Comparison of coeffi-

cients across decades or by age group shows no clear pattern of temporal change. It appears that education is about as important in 1990 as in 1980, and for young couples as for all age groups.
With education controlled, higher earnings increase the likelihood of interracial marriage for white women. This result is interesting because higher education was correlated with interracial marriage for each group except white women. The implied exchange of wife's income for husband's education in marriages between white women and black men raises an interesting question regarding the importance of different aspects of social status in different types of marriage.
Income effects for other groups are less clear. Among black men, higher income was negatively associated with interracial marriage in 1980 but not in 1990. Income coefficients are negative for white men for three of the four coefficients, as exchange theory would predict. Coefficients are positive for black women but none are statistically significant. Thus, income coefficients tend to fit the exchange model for marriages between white men and black women, but not for marriages between white women and black men.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
Data from the most recent censuses support the conclusion that racial barriers in mate selection are weakening. Interracial marriages are more likely in 1990 than in 1980, and in younger cohorts. The least common type of marriage--between black women and white men--has increased at a faster

pace than marriage between white women and black men. Recent changes, however, should not be overstated. The change between 1980 and 1990 narrowed the gap between observed 1980 patterns and expected patterns if marriage were random with respect to race by less than 2 per cent.
Early explanations for interracial marriage assumed that because their race was viewed as a negative characteristic, blacks who married whites would need to substitute other advantages such as higher socioeconomic status to compensate. Although some early research did not fully support this model, it has retained some credibility. Perhaps the prominence of the model's proponents has played some role in its persistence. From this model, we expected to find lower status among whites who marry blacks, and higher status among blacks who marry whites. Instead, the most prominent pattern in these data is that people who marry interracially tend to have higher status, regardless of race, than do those in homogamous marriages. Interracial marriage among higher status individuals could result both from structural and social psychological tendencies. Homans (1974) argues that higher status gives individuals more freedom to violate norms. Structural isolation and segregation, as noted by Wilson (1987) and Massey and Denton (1993), reduce the contact between lower-status blacks and whites. College attendance, in particular, may play an important role in increasing the pool of eligible partners and in weakening traditional norms favoring ascriptive marriage. Whatever the explanation, the proposition that higher socioeconomic status facilitates interracial marriage deserves further attention.

Patterns of exchanging lower racial status for higher socioeconomic status emerge only after we take into account the more dominant pattern of higher socioeconomic status in interracial marriages. The exchange pattern is more clear for education than for income, however.
We do observe the anticipated greater gaps between husband's and wife's status in black-husband-whitewife marriages and smaller gaps in black-wife-white-husband marriages. This finding is consistent with the claim that white women are more willing to marry black men if they have higher socioeconomic status. Only after adjusting for the overall lower status of black men does it appear that white women marry up. When we also take into account income, results are even less clear as higher earnings are predictive of interracial marriage among white women.
Clearly something more complex than exchange of race for status is occurring. At least four tendencies may be involved in interracial marriage, including: (1) greater freedom to violate norms among higher status individuals, (2) some preference for similarity in socioeconomic status, (3) exchange of socioeconomic and racial characteristics, and (4) greater emphasis on socioeconomic roles of men. The combination of the first three tendencies would increase the likelihood of interracial marriage among high status individuals and would result in the educational differences we observe once the larger effect of the first tendency is removed.
Finally, declining racial prejudice and replacement of ascriptive norms by achievement norms would imply both a decline in the socioeconomic gap between spouses in interracial marriages
