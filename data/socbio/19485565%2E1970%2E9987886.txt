Intermarriage among Ethnic Groups in the United States

Bureau of the Census Washington, D.C.

Information from the 1960 census throws light on the extent of intermarriage among persons of different ethnic groups. Here the term "ethnic groups" is used to refer to racial and national origin groups. An analysis of the census data tends to confirm the impression that marriages generally occur among persons of the same ethnic, group. However, there are important exceptions to this general rule, and the magnitude of the exceptions varies considerably. In the context of this situation where "like tends to marry like," this paper will show how much ethnic group intermarriage occurs under varying circumstances and will present some interpretive comments which are suggested by the data.1
RACE OF HUSBAND AND WIFE
The first census tabulations of race of husband by race of wife were made from the 1960 census. That was the first decennial census in which persons were offered the opportunity to record their own race on a self-enumeration form. This procedure
1A somewhat different treatment of census data on intermarriage among racial and national origin groups is presented in Carter and Glick, 1970, p. 112-143. Other references to the voluminous literature on intermarriage include Heer, 1966; Bernard, 1966; and several hundred references in Aldous and Hill, 1967.

greatly increased the likelihood of obtaining appropriate racial classifications as compared with earlier censuses when the enumerator was instructed to enter information about race by observation of the household respondent. However, for the unknown proportion of persons whose race was not recorded by self-enumeration, an interviewer obtained the information on race by observation during a visit to the household.
According to the 1960 census, only 163,800 married couples, or fourth-tenths of one per cent of the 40,491,000 married couples in the United States, comprised a husband and wife of different races. These racially mixed marriages were distributed as shown in Table 1.
Nearly one-third of the racial mixtures consist of Negroes married to whites. Of the 55,000 white men married to wives of "other races," 22,000 were married to Japanese wives. Similarly, of the 5,000 Negro men married to wives of "other races," 2,000 were married to Japanese wives. Almost all of the intermarriage involving husbands and wives of two different "other races" related to persons of American Indian, Oriental, or Polynesian origin.2
2 Persons of "other races" are subdivided by the Bureau of the Census into several categories which

A very small proportion (less than one per cent) of the white persons or Negroes who entered their first marriage during the 1950's married persons of a different race. By sharp contrast, 38% of the Japanese wives, 33% of the Filipino wives, and 24% of the American Indian wives who first married in the 1950's were married to husbands of a different race, usually white men. Corresponding figures for men who out-married were smaller for the Japanese (9%) and American Indians (19%), but reached 42% for Filipinos. About 18% of the Chinese men and 14% of the Chinese women who first married in the 1950's did not have a Chinese spouse. A large majority of the Japanese and Filipino population of the United States live in California or Hawaii, and nearly half of the Chinese live in California.
The substantial proportions of Japanese and Filipino women who married men of a different race during the 1950's can probably be accounted for to a large extent by marriages they contracted with military men

from the United States. By way of comparison among married women in 1960 who had entered marriage before 1940, only 8% of the Japanese and 16% of the Filipinos had married men of a different race.
Persons with racial intermarriages had some noteworthy patterns of distribution in regard to region of residence and educational level. These patterns were observed among couples who had entered marriages during the 1950's involving a Negro married to a white person, both married only once at the time of the 1960 census. The numbers of such persons were small: 6,082 white husbands married to Negro wives and 7,534 Negro husbands married to white wives (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1966, Table 12). Although these numbers are small, the corresponding figures at later census dates will very likely be much larger. Meanwhile, information from the 1970 census will update the 1960 data presented here on the manner in which such marriages are distributed.
Although the proportion Negro in the total population in 1960 was more than three times as large in the South as in the North and West, the number of southern Negrowhite couples (reported as married for the first time in the 1950's) constituted only 0.16% of all southern couples (reported as married in the 1950's), very slightly larger than the corresponding proportion in the North and West (0.14%). Three out of five of the couples with mixed marriages in the South involved a white husband with a Negro wife, whereas three out of five of those in the North and West involved a Negro husband with a white wife. Evidently, most of the interracial unions in the South in 1960 were either based on common-law marriages or on marriages contracted outside the South, because marriages between Negroes and white persons were not legal in the South at that time.
Persons who had intermarried also tended to differ in respect to educational level from

those with unmixed marriages (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1966, Table 12). The selective process in Negro-white intermarriage most often involved Negroes with more education than those who had married another Negro and white persons with less education than those who had married another white person. In the context of racial attitudes that still prevail among a large proportion of the population in the United States, this selective process in marriage hasbeen interpreted in terms of an exchange theory, wherein the Negro tends to offer a premium (more education) to marry a white person.3
CURRENT FERTILITY RATES BY RACENATIVITY OF HUSBAND AND WIFE
Information from the 1960census on the fertility rates of women in racially mixed and unmixed marriages is available only in terms of the number of young children who were living with their parents. These rates are based on data from a 5% sample
3 This and other theories of mate selection are discussed in Rodman, 1965, p.43-72.

of women in 1960. Because of the small number of racially mixed marriages, no attempt was made to tabulate fertility data for women in such marriages during the 1960's from the Current Population Survey, which is based on a sample of less than one-tenth of one per cent. Also, because Negro women are much more likely than white women to have living children who reside with someone else, these "fertility rates" tend to be understated for Negroes by approximately 10% (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1968, p. 5).The rates shown in Table 2 have not been adjusted for this deficiency. Such an adjustment would have generally increased the whiteNegro differentials.
Data shown here for white women are limited to native whites; the number of foreign-born white women married to husbands of races other than white was too small to show for any of the five-year age groups. Foreign-born white women below age 30 who were married to white men tended to have lower fertility than comparable native white women, but at some

of the older ages within the reproductive range the reverse was found.
White women had the lowest fertility in almost all combinations of age of wife and race of husband. This finding was most consistent among women near the beginning and end of the reproductive age range, where fertility rates are usually low among groups with low fertility for all ages combined.
Negro women married to Negro men had especially high fertility rates before the age of 25 years, whereas women of "other races" married to men of "other races" had relatively high fertility rates at older ages. Among the factors underlying these differentials are a pattern of early mating among Negroes and a rather high average age at marriage among persons of "other races."
Fertility rates among women in mixed marriages tended to be lowest for whiteand-Negro mixtures; these rates were about 10% above the fertility rate for unmixed white couples and 20% below the fertility rate for unmixed Negro couples. In all combinations of racial groups which included one spouse of "other races," the fertility rates ranged from moderately high to very high. The highest fertility rate of all was that for women of "other races" married to white men; this rate was 10% above that for women of "other races" married to men of "other races" and half again as high as that for white women married to white men. The high fertility rate in 1960 for women of "other races" in their early thirties who were married to white men very likely reflects a tendency toward large families among Japanese and Filipino women who married white men abroad after World War II.
The high ratios of children to women among Negroes in their late thirties and early forties may reflect, at least to a minor extent, misreporting of grandchildren as own children of the woman, especially

where a young mother has left her children under the care of their grandmother while she works at another location. The likelihood that such misreporting is minor is supported by the fact that middle-aged family heads in 1960 who were reported as having grandchildren as household members (rather than misreported as own children in the household) constituted more than twice as large a proportion among nonwhite than white families (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1963, Table 18).
NATIONAL ORIGIN OF HUSBAND AND WIFE
Most of the persons of first- or secondgeneration "foreign stock" in the United States are white. About two-thirds of them in 1960 had one of the following seven countries as their national origin, as determined on the basis of their own or their father's country of birth (or mother's country of birth if father was native): United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Germany, Poland, U.S.S.R., and Italy.
In I960, of the 40,491,000 married couples in the United States, 10,973,000 of the husbands and 10,320,000 of the wives were of foreign stock. Among those of foreign stock about three out of eight married a native person of native parentage, a similar proportion married a person of foreign stock with the same national origin, and the remaining one-fourth married a person of foreign stock with a different national origin.
These facts provide evidence that the amount of marriage outside one's own national origin is rather extensive; yet a part of those of first- or second-generation foreign stock who married native persons of native parentage undoubtedly had actually married persons of "third-generation or earlier foreign stock" with the same national origin. However, information on national origin was not collected in the 1960 census for

296

such an early generation. Moreover, since the national origin of second-generation Americans with both parents foreign born was arbitrarily based on the country of birth of the father, some of the out-marriages made on this basis would have been counted as in-marriages if national origin had been based on the country of birth of the mother or on the country of birth of either parent.
Sharp changes in the extent of out-marriage had occurred between the first and second generation in America. Only 38% of the first-generation husbands had out-married as compared with 6 1 % of the secondgeneration husbands. An extreme group was the Italians, of whom only one out of five had out-married in the first generation,

whereas the corresponding figure for the second generation exceeded one-half of all marriages.
Persons of foreign stock with the United Kingdom or Ireland as their national origin were actually more likely to marry a person with a different origin than one with their own origin, as may be seen in Table 3. Outmarriage among these persons was heaviest with persons from English-speaking countries or with Germans. Two-thirds or more of the husbands or wives of foreign stock with the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, or Germany as their national origin had married a spouse with one of the same four countries as their national origin.
