ABSTRACT: This historical prospective study is aimed at the underscoring of the independent effect of a set of familial characteristics on age at time of death broken down into ten age groups (from 0 through 90 years and over). The study is concerned with the small rural population of Isle-auxCoudres, Quebec. The following familial traits were analyzed: parental consanguinity, maternal and paternal age at time of childbirth, sex, birth order, the interval since the previous birth, month of birth, viability of the preceding infant, the number of deceased family members in the age groups 0-1, 1-4 and more than S years at the time of the child's birth. A multiple discriminant analysis has been worked out first on a birth cohort (1880-99) with no underreporting of infant mortality (Stage 1). Subsequently, four other cohorts were analyzed in the same way (Stage 2). Stage 1 analysis opposes the two extremities of the life span to the age group 5-69 years, and points to maternal age, among other less important variables, as a factor of offspring early (less than 5) or advanced age (over 70) at time of death. Stage 2 analysis shows inconsistencies with Stage 1 results. Taking account of family size, further investigations supported the view that offspring survival to either early or advanced age could vary from family to family.

sidual sample. Quebec civil records, though not relieving the possible bias due to sample attrition, may however become a valid alternative in the undertaking of historic follow-up studies in human biology (Philippe, 1975). Actually, parish records reporting births, marriages, and deaths were investigated since colonization of the country, and the families reconstructed with the aid of informatic devices for any period of time. This task was undertaken for seven French Canadian populations in 1967. Details of data management were published elsewhere (Gomila and Guyon, 1969). Several studies of data collected in the one population of Isleaux-Coudres, colonized in 1728, were reported previously. All have benefited from a historical prospective approach.
Besides possible historical follow-up of demographic events occurring to families, comparative analysis of several birth cohorts may overcome to a certain extent the effect due to migration. In this study, an attempt is made to compare the results obtained in different subsamples of the Isleaux-Coudres population (two stages analysis) in the hope to sort out the biological factors conveyed by the demographic variables associated with differential survival.
In addition to the age at death, expressed in complete months, each individual has been characterized by the following familial characteristics: extent of inbreeding1, age of the mother and father at the time of the child's birth, sex, birth order, interval since previous birth, month of birth, viability of the preceding infant, the number of deceased sibs in the age groups of 0 to 1,1 to 4, and more than 5 years at the time of the child's birth. Each of these variables was broken down

into multiple categories converted in their turn into binary variables in order to identify clearly the original variable categories which might be related to a specific age at death (shown in Table 3). The ten age groups merged were then subjected to multiple discriminant analysis (Seal, 1964). The latter permits the evaluation of the variation of each age group on the basis of a linear combination of the binary variables (26 in this study) and the clarification of the influence of any familial correlates category to age at time of death.
The resulting discriminant function is of the following form
AXp
where the A's are the discriminant coefficients attached to each familial trait category (X*s). The basic principle of the discriminatory variable (Y) is to maximize separation of age groups by increasing the ratio of between-age-groups variance to within-age-group variance.
The discriminant function coefficients thus represent the exclusive contribution of each familial trait category to age groups at death, taking into account the set of all intercorrelations. The order of magnitude of the coefficient, account taken of its sign, represents the greater or lesser weight of the familial trait category in relation to a specific age group at death. It is the discriminatory power of the familial trait category. Once the discriminant function is obtained, each individual characterized by all of its familial coordinates is assigned an objective discriminant value (Y)when processed through the discriminantJunction. A mean discriminant variable (Y) is thus yielded for each age group at death, the components of which being the individual discriminatory variables derived from the original variables hyperspace.

that increased maternal age is the main factor common to both early or late death.
Less correlated with early death are month of birth and high parity, along with an elevated number of infant deaths within the family. Similarly, advanced age at death is feebly but significantly associated with the male sex and an increased number of child deaths.
Since advanced maternal age stands for the main discriminator of both extremities of the life span and since not all the binary variables were retained in the course of the analyses, we felt justified in assembling into a single group the age groups which resembled each other (0-4 and 70-89); this group was compared to the group composed of those persons who died between the ages of 5 and 69 years. This procedure allowed us to determine the overall contribution of all of the 26 variables to age at death. The two groups were significantly different (p<0.006) on the basis of the 26 binary variables due to less heterogeneity between the groups. Table 3 provides the extent of the contribution of the familial characteristics to survival. Only the most important factors will be underscored here.

The increasing age of the mother, especially after 35 years, increases the probability of both an early (0-4 years) and late death (70-89 years) even though childhood mortality at that time was largely due to exogeneous factors (positive signs). The father's age, which exerts an influence nearly equal to that of the mother, begins to cancel the latter with advancing years (negative signs). An interval of more than 22 months from the preceding birth is characteristic of deaths occurring in the age group 5-69 years. The numerical position of offspring in the family, the month of birth, and the male sex are only weakly correlated with early or late death as expected. Otherwise, numerous juvenile deaths in the family is related to ego's death between 5 and 69 years of age.
STAGE 2: COHORT ANALYSIS, 1800-29, 1830-49,1850-69, AND 1870-79
These cohorts have an infant mortality underreporting rate on the order of 23 per cent. Table 4 provides, for each of the above cohorts, the sample size of each age group, the mean discriminant variable for each age group, and the significance of the dissimilarity. No cohort demonstrated an appreciable degree of significance when analyses were concerned with ten age groups and 26 variables. Furthermore, the pattern of signs opposing both extremities of the life span observed in the 1880-99 cohort does not appear as clearly as one would wish. This, of course, may be ascribed to the small size of the samples and to poor discrimination among age groups.
Nevertheless, we obtained significant dissimilarities with smaller subsets of variables. It was remarkable that advanced maternal age at birth remained the single most important discriminator of very late death (more than 70 years of age) except for the 1830-49 births cohort. On the

regularity in the profile, very evident for the period 1880-99, which lends a certain credence to the observations. No doubt it is easier, based on such small sample sizes, to dismantle such a complex profile than to construct it at random.
If one tries to construct the typical profile of the two opposite age groups here, it is seen that the familial characteristics of the average person is described by a negative discriminant mean. These people do not exhibit any particular susceptibility to either early or, in particular, to a very late death. A positive profile looks different: It conforms as much to a child who died before one year of age as to an elderly person over 80 years of age. Using a different method, an amazingly similar result was discovered by Lederman and Breas (1959) and discussed later by Bourgeois-Pichat (1963). Neither could interpret the phenomenon.
No definite effect of very short time lapse between conceptions could be found. Intervals of at least 22 months between confinements, however, were correlated with an ordinary survival (5-69 age group). On the other hand, it is likely that

an association does exist between multiple juvenile deaths within families and average survival due to exposure to common environmental agents.
The most important variables of the setting up of the pattern of signs characteristic of the life span are undoubtedly parental ages at birth of the offspring. The similarity between high risk individuals (early death) and those with unusually long survival (more than 70 years) is supported, particularly if the mother is at an advanced age at the child's birth while the father's age is less. This fact gives support to the well-known contention that an age difference between spouses at birth of child leads to increased infant mortality (Newcombe et al., 1965; Spiers, 1972; James, 1974a). Furthermore, Jalavisto (1950) showed that a mother's advanced age (more than 40 years) at birth is positively correlated with the life expectancy of the offspring until he reaches 50 years of age. After 50 years of age, this trend would seem to be reversed but on the basis of an extrapolation of the trend. Some research suggests that the aging of the ovocytes would generally predispose a child to

Vol. 27, No. 3

an early death (Curtis, 1963). However, the observed independent and opposite effect of paternal age could otherwise insure the selection of only the strongest sperm. The maternal age influence would thereby be controlled in the latter zygotes.
We may perhaps consider that what we generally call a "high risk constitution," which results in a positive score, also represents the make-up of individuals who are likely to live longer than the average (more than 70 years). This phenomenon is not unknown among animals (Parsons, 1964). In an extensive review of the comparative biology of aging, Rockstein et al. (1977) report that in the house fly and in D. Pseudoobscura longer-lived males are produced from older mothers. The authors think that sex-limited genetic factors might be transmitted to the males from longer-lived and presumably more viable mothers (p. 8). The same has been observed in inbred strains of mares. However, the case of rotifers is different in that old mothers give birth to shorter-lived offspring and conversely. Following a somewhat similar line of evidence, our contention is that individuals from both extremes of the life span have a constitution very sensitive to harmful conditions, either exogenous (limited breast feeding) or particular genetic traits. Thus, it has recently been shown that an elevated G-type immunoglobulin (Ig G) concentration but a low M-type immunoglobulin (Ig M) constitutes the most characteristic factor of persons who survive more than 70 years (Buckley and Roseman, 1976).
It has been stated recently that the risks of an early or late fetal death, neonatal mortality, and most congenital malformations might not increase with the mother's age (Magaud and Henry, 1968; James, 1974b). The phenomenon could best be explained by the increased fertility of high risk mothers (James, 1976). Said another way, the size of the family as related to the

mother's age would constitute a discriminant factor for mortality at an early age (Krauss et al., 1972; Dott and Fort, 1975). In order to examine this point further, we have grouped families with at least ten children and went on to a discriminant analysis for three age groups, 0-4 (N=52), 5-69 (N = 69), and 2*70 (JV=49) for all cohorts simultaneously. For families of constant size, the family survival traits were all homogenous (P=0.727). Furthermore, no single variable contributed in differentiating the age groups. The degree of significance confirms the homogeneity obtained when keeping family size constant. Though this type of analysis with its grouping of multiple generations must be assessed cautiously, this new result suggests that the life expectancy of the offspring would neither increase nor decrease with the age of his parents at birth. On one hand, this contradicts observations previously made in animals and, on the other hand, bur own results reported hereabove. If the effect of family size is real, two important conclusions may be reached. First, the treatment of longitudinal observation varying during time with a cross-sectional analysis may yield artifactual results. And second, the factual observed variability in age at time of death, presumably independent of all familial correlates studied here, would rather imply probabilities of survival varying greatly from family to family. Accordingly, differential survival of offspring would be correlated to family size. Although this latter statement deserves to be carefully evaluated, it could include observations already made though in a neither systematic nor controlled fashion. For instance, in several monographs describing presumably long-lived individuals, large family size and advanced maternal age at child-bearing have been reported. Obviously, this statement does not prove a causal relationship between
