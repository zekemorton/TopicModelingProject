ABSTRACT: This paper examines the fertility attitudes of a sample of 202 male Nigerian students studying in the United States. Specifically, three dimensions were investigated: (1) perceptions of population problems in Nigeria; (2) attitudes toward family planning, divorce, and male children; and (3) attitudes toward family size.
Findings indicate that: (1) In general, this sample does not believe there is a population problem in Nigeria, and rapid population growth is not a cause of poverty, poor health, or unemployment; (2) the majority of respondents agree that a government population policy should be adopted, but does not agree with government interference in the number of children a couple desires; (3) family planning information and services should be made available to men, but women should not practice family planning without the consent of their husbands; (4) duration of stay in the United States is inversely correlated with the number of children considered too many; and, (5) the number of male children is an extremely important variable in regard to additional children desired.
Very little research has been conducted exclusively on male fertility attitudes in Nigeria, whereas those on women are numerous. Policies based on female fertility research do not appear to be solving the problem of rapid population growth in Nigeria and other African nations. The thrust of this paper, therefore, is to redress the unbalanced orientation in the study of fertility by securing information from men. Implications of the findings, recommendations, and future research issues are discussed.

The role of American education in the development process of many African nations has been recognized not only in terms of the human resources developed, but as a catalyst in promoting values, beliefs, and perceptions that are congruent with some elements of modernism--such as belief in science, ability to control one's fate, new waysof doing things such as attempting to control births, and openness to new ideals (Inkeles and Smith, 1974).

Ogunbi (1978) identified some of the main objectives of training foreign students from developing countries in the United States: (1) to enable them to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to solve the problems of their societies more efficiently; (2) to train individuals so they can act as agents of change, bringing innovative ideas to complement development efforts; and (3) to help their countries' effort toward modernization by waging war on poverty, illiteracy, and disease and to assist in manpower development.
The acceptance of the active role of American-trained returnees in the development process of developing coun-

tries has been recognized by many Western observers (for example, see Harari, 1970). Evans (1962) asserted that in Tropical Africa, Western education has been the catalyst of modern aspirations of the new African countries. Evans, however, maintained that Western education inculcates new values, which may promote social and political development among African nations. Similarly, Veroff (1963, p. 48) made the following statements about African students in the United States:
Prognosticators of future events should not minimize the potential impact of our African students currently studying in this country. Among this group will be the political leaders, the technicians and the teachers. . . . what these students take away with them about human knowledge, and perhaps even more important, about our country, can have major implications in the political alignments of the future.
Given the role expectations of American-trained Nigerians, the expenditure in training them abroad, and the high number of returnees, the inability of the Nigerian government to control one of the major crises facing the country, i.e., rapid population growth, represents a paradox. Many Western demographers are faced with the question of what kind of fertility attitudes are developed and transplanted after Nigerian students complete their studies in the United States.
This study attempts to push beyond the conventional approach to the study of fertility attitudes. It focuses on the fertility attitudes of male Nigerian students in the United States in an attempt to examine the perception of these students concerning population problems in their country, and more importantly, the type of fertility attitudes they de-

velop while studying in the United States. Specifically, this analysis addresses three dimensions: (1) perceptions of population problems in Nigeria; (2) attitudes toward family planning, divorce, and male children; and (3) attitudes toward family size. Veroff (1963, p. 48) emphasized:
One of the ways we look at the effect of American schooling on African students is to assess any changes in their attitudes occurring in the course of their sojourn. Some understanding may be gained, thus, as to what kind of leaders with what kind of images are returning to Africa.
These students are of special interest for several reasons: (1) university students are identified as a key group that takes active stands on policy issues in Nigeria; (2) university students are for the most part the future policy makers of Nigeria, at least, by virtue of their education; (3) the men in this sample have been exposed to the outside world, especially to the United States where communication, has increased their awareness of rapid population growth in Africa and the world, (4) Nigeria is mostly a male-dominated society, and (5) because of their exposure to western influence they are expected to manifest some of the characteristics of modernism, such as attempting to control births (Inkeles, 1966).
Nigeria is one of the fastest growing countries in the world and the most populous in Africa. The present population growth rate is 3.1-3.4 per cent per year. Over 48 per cent of the population is under 15 years of age, and 3 per cent are over 65 years, making the dependency ratio very high. Nigeria's age structure depicts a most unfavorable picture for economic growth because of the overwhelming preponderance of children of dependent, non-productive age. Chil-

dren as a category are making the transition from producers to consumers. This puts a heavy drain on the Nigerian economy, particularly when the transition development process calls for education and keeps the young dependent.
One of the major limitations facing Nigerian-based fertility research is the neglect of the role of men in probing the circumstances that govern the number of children, as well as the reproductive behavior of a couple. Research in this area has been dominated by facts derived exclusively from women and most policies based on these facts have not been successful in reducing the fertility of women in Nigeria. Although Mott and Mott (1985) compared husbands and wives in regard to household fertility decisions in a Nigerian village, the primary focus was on women of childbearing age. This is not to suggest that results of female fertility studies are not valid, or are irrelevant. However, it is felt that by tapping similar information from men, the gender-gap in Nigerian fertility research may be partially filled and more importantly, an accurate picture of the role of men in women's reproductive behavior in Nigeria may be observed.
Like most African nations, Nigeria is a partrilineal society. The male is very important in decision-making concerning the reproductive behavior of women. In a patrilineal family system, the children born to a wife belong to her husband. This is manifested in divorce cases in Nigeria, where women have to leave their children with their husbands. The fertility attitudes of women are mostly dictated by masculine values. As Arowolo (1976, p. 12) confirmed:
In Nigeria, if the man desires a certain family size, there is little the women can

do to prevent having that number of children. Should she fail to produce children of a particular sex, or be unable to achieve the desired family size due to fecundity impairment, infant mortality, or both, the man can and does take another woman.
Pronatalist pressures are reinforced by the domination of males over females which preclude women from controlling their own fertility. The rapid increase in population growth in Nigeria is in fact accentuated by the very pronatalist attitudes of men. For example: (1) most Nigerian men place a high premium on many children and are strongly motivated to demand this of their wives; (2) men attribute social status to women on the basis of number of children; (3) men become polygnists because of the barrenness of their wives; (4) men tend to marry younger women who will guarantee them many years of childbearing; (5) they prefer to marry women who have already given evidence of fertility by their pregnancy (Brown, 1981; Bhatia, 1978; Huston, 1977; Clignet and Sween, 1974; Caldwell, 1967). Despite these pronatalist attributes manifested by Nigerian men and documented by empirical research, policy-based research to reduce high fertility in Nigeria has failed to examine the complementarity of the male perspective (Heisel, 1973; Okediji, 1967).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The data presented here come from a fertility attitude survey of male Nigerian students in the United States conducted in 1984. The study population consisted of all Nigerian students enrolled in the six Kansas regent's institutions. These institutions were chosen because they

offer a good mix of Nigerian population in terms of age, education, marital status, religious affiliation, and duration of stay. The 220 male students represent a composite of undergraduate and graduate students.
The survey instrument was a mailback questionnaire of items related to fertility attitudes, as well as social, economic, and demographic characteristics. Dillman's (1978) sampling procedure was employed. Questionnaires were sent to all 220 students, and 202 questionnaires were returned, for a 92 per cent response rate.
SOCIAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SAMPLE
This sample is somewhat unique in that these men are highly educated compared to Nigeria men in general and they have been exposed to Western values. The purpose of selecting this sample was twofold: (1) Most of these men will be in various decision-making positions in their careers; and, (2) as a result of their education and positions they will be the future "trend-setters" in Nigerian society. For example, if the educated professional-technical class in Nigeria have certain attitudes and behavior, one can assume that these attitudes and behavior, will eventually diffuse throughout the society as development progresses. If these men have large families, we should expect all Nigerian men to have/desire large families. However, if this sample (as an indicator) develops a modern attitude toward fertility and family size, the expectation is that this attitude will eventually spread beyond the educated professionaltechnical class.
These assumptions are also based on characteristics of Nigerian men studying in the United States. Of those who are

married, approximately 90 per cent are married to Nigerian women. In terms of assimilation, 80 to 85 per cent return to Nigeria after they complete their studies. In this sample, 86 per cent expect to return to Nigeria, and 11 per cent were uncertain. Only 3 per cent said they plan not to return to Nigeria.
A sizeable proportion of Nigerian students are supported by Nigerian government or university scholarships. In this sample 31 per cent were supported in this way. This makes the sample population older than university students in Nigeria and American university students. The mean age of this sample was 30.7 years (28.7 years for undergraduates, and 33.5 years for graduate students). Those respondents supported by Nigerian government or university scholarships were already working for the government or a university. Moreover, 58 per cent of the sample was composed of undergraduate students and 42 per cent, graduate students, which also makes the age distribution of this sample older, since graduate students are generally older (see Table 1 for social and demographic characteristics of the sample).
Upon their return to Nigeria, the majority will seek employment in federal or state government. The university system and the private sector cannot absorb all degree holders. Therefore, the government is the largest employer of those with degrees.

Western opinion about Nigeria's popu-

respondents indicate that there are "too many people," whereas 40per cent think that there are "just enough people," 13 per cent indicate that there are "not enough people" and 7 per cent responded "didn't know." Evidently, a majority of students do not consider overpopulation as an impending crisis in Nigeria. These responses may explain the lassitude, until recently of Nigeria's government toward population control. Several factors may influence the perception of those students concerning Ni-

geria's population growth; for example, (1) the respondent's may view a rapidly growing population as a pathway to economic development, especially if the oil economy is turned around, and (2) since the respondents represent a good mix of the three major ethnic groups in Nigeria, the struggle for ethnic domination may influence their perception.
When a question was asked as to whether "abject poverty, poor health, and high unemployment in Nigeria are partly rooted in excess population growth," the majority of respondents (68 per cent) did not see overpopulation as a contributing factor whereas 29 per cent responded "yes," and 4 per cent indicated "don't know."
The opinions of the students concerning the adoption of a population control policy by the Nigerian government was examined. Fifty-three per cent agreed that the government should adopt a population policy. However, government interference in the number of children a couple desires was clearly not endorsed. Sixty-seven per cent of the respondents agreed or strongly agreed that the government should not interfere with family size. It seems that the majority of respondents are aware of the future danger of rapid population growth (by a positive response to a government population policy), but consider government interference with family size as an invasion of privacy or an infringment on their individual freedom.
ATTITUDES TOWARD FAMILY PLANNING,
DIVORCE, AND MALE CHILDREN
Table 3 reveals that an overwhelming majority of the sample (84 per cent) endorses the idea that family planning information and services should be made

available to men. This does not imply that family planning information will result in low fertility. Family planning information may be perceived as useful in pacing or understanding how births are prevented and not necessarily in reducing the number of children.
This notion may find support since 69 per cent agree with the item that women should not practice family planning without the consent of their husbands. The general attitude of the respondents toward abortion varied considerably. More than half of the sample (55 per cent) oppose abortion, whereas 29 per cent approve and 16 per cent were uncertain.
Table 3 indicates that the sample of men favor having family planning information, but want to control family plan-

ning practice and utilization among women.
Table 4 presents data on attitudes toward divorce and male children. Fortythree per cent of the respondents claimed that divorce should result from "barrenness of wife," "inability of the wife to bear a male child," and "the inability to bear the number of children demanded by her husband." Although the majority didn't respond in this way, the large number who did indicate that the male Nigerian students in this sample place a high value on children.
The fact that 36 per cent of the respondents indicated that a man should divorce his wife if she were barren is not a strange phenomenon in the context of Nigerian culture. One major explanation is the widely-held notion within the society that the woman is more likely to account for a couple's childlessness than the male. Secondly, the fact that polygyny is a common practice among Nigerian men may explain why a preponderance of this population did not consider any of the conditions as grounds for divorce, since a man can marry a second or third wife.
Nearly 35 per cent of the respondents indicated that a man should marry a second wife or continue to have children if a couple had five daughters and no sons. Twenty-six per cent indicated that a man should adopt a baby boy or be content in this situation. Little can be generalized from this item since 39 per cent responded "don't know." However, with 35 per cent marrying a second wife or continuing to have children, and 39 per cent uncertain what to do in this situation suggests the importance of having male children regardless of parity.
The final item in Table 4 represents the general view of the respondents about the value of children. Sixty-two

On the other hand, they may consider "wealth" as function of status afforded them by the number of children they have, particularly sons.

ATTITUDES TOWARD FAMILY SIZE
Table 5 displays zero-order correlation coefficients among selected family size variables for the married respondents with children. There is a significant inverse correlation (r = -0.18, p < 0.05) between additional number of children and number of male children. This finding seems to give empirical endorsement to the fact that married respondents with more male children tend to want fewer additional children. A positive relationship between additional number of children and the number of female children is evident (r = --0.19, p < 0.05), indicating that married men with relatively more female children want to increase their number of children. However, when the number of male children was controlled, the observed correlation between parity and additional number of children increased

from r = 0.00 to r = 0.23 (p < 0.05). This demonstrates that the number of male children a man has is an important determinant of future family size.
Respondents' duration of stay in the United States and the number of children considered "too many" depicts a significant negative correlation (r = -- 0.24,p < 0.001). This relationship tends to be more pronounced after a respondent has been in the United States for more than four years. Controlling for age, we find that the partial correlation coefficient between duration of stay and number of children considered "too many" increases to r = --0.33 (p< 0.001). Regardless of age, the longer a student stays in the United States, the number of children consid'ered too many declines.
As one would expect, the correlation between number of wives and parity was significantly correlated (r = 0.64,

p< 0.001). Furthermore, the relationship between additional number of children and number of wives was significantly correlated (r = 0.31, p< 0.001). In other words, those respondents with more than one wife desire more children than respondents with one wife.
In summary, the results of the correlation analysis reveals the following: (1) duration of stay in the United States was inversely correlated with the number of children considered "too many"; and, (2) the number of male children is an important control variable with regard to additional number of children. In essence, the actual fertility of the men in this sample was greatly affected by the sex of their children.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
The purpose of this research was to examine the fertility attitudes of male Nigerian students in the United States, and to address the gender gap in Nigerian fertility research. This research differs somewhat from other research endeavors that have included men in Nigeria (Caldwell, 1982; Owie, 1980) in the sense that men in this sample manifest the following characteristics: (1) Their infants and children have a lower mortality rate, making fewer births necessary for any desired number of children; (2) they may consider children more of a liability rather than an asset because of their non-agrarian lifestyle, Western socialization, and being taken out of the typical Nigerian family context; and (3) they have better access to information about means of fertility control.
The major findings of this paper are:

(1) In general, the majority do not believe there is a population problem in Nigeria, and rapid population growth is not a cause of poverty, poor health, or unemployment; (2) the majority of respondents agree that a government population policy should be adopted, but they do not agree with government interference in the number of children a couple desires; (3) family planning information and services should be made available to men, but women should not practice family planning without the consent of their husbands; (4) a large minority (43 per cent) believe a man should divorce his wife if the wife is barren, unable to bear a male child, or unable to bear the number of children demanded by her husband; (5) 35 per cent indicated that a man should "marry a second wife," or "continue to have children" if a couple has five daughters and no sons; (6) 62 per cent indicated that "children are wealth" or "better than wealth"; (7) duration of stay in the United States was inversely correlated with the number of children considered too many; and (8) the number of male children is an extremely important variable in regard to additional children desired.
The preference for male over female children is not unique to this sample of men. Harari (1970) found that desire for sons is stronger in males than in females in Africa. Also, Williamson (1976) found the preference for male children is common in Latin American countries. However, the males in this sample will be among the most educated in Nigeria, and they still seem to hold some fairly traditional values in regard to fertility and family formation.
The average number of children desired by married male respondents was higher than that desired by their wives

66

(5.4 and 4.4, respectively). The reason for such a sex differential may be that women are more likely to be content with the sex of their children. The blame of not having a male child or childlessness is always on the women. Bhatia's (1978) study of ideal number of children and sex preference in India revealed that husbands, on the average, desire more children than wives (9.3 and 6.4, respectively). Spillane and Ryser (1975) observed a slight difference in desired number of children between husbands and wives in the U.S.
It appears that level of education does not have a great impact on fertility attitudes in this sample, particularly the desire for male children. In addition, age at marriage does not affect the fertility attitudes of the married respondents. Men prefer to marry younger women who will guarantee many years of childbearing. The age difference between husbands and wife is consistent with Ware's (1979) view that most African men will not forego their studies for marriage. In Ghana, Caldwell (1967) observed that age at marriage increases with education. Caldwell's study also reveals that husbands were 5 to 6 years older than their wives in urban areas and approximately 12years older in rural areas. Bhatia's analysis of reproductive norms and behavior in rural Ghana indicates that men were on the average 9 years older than their wives. While most studies found that lower fertility of educated women in Nigeria disappears when age at marriage was held constant (Olusanya, 1967;Ohadike, 1967), age at marriage does not affect the fertility of men in this sample. Married men were 8.5 years older than their wives (34.6 and 26.1 years, respectively).
The theoretical assumption that

higher education results in lower fertility, at best, may hold for both men and women in developed nations where there is a slight, or no age differential between husband and wife. Furthermore, nearly 70 per cent of the respondents agree that a woman should not practice birth control without the consent of her husband. In Kenya, Huston (1977) observed that women need their husband's permission to attend family planning clinics. With this caveat in mind, the theory and practice of family planning evidently ignores male dominance when women are pressured to practice family planning.
Based on the population dimensions investigated in this research, namely, perceptions of population problems in Nigeria, attitudes toward family planning, divorce, and male children, and attitudes toward family size, it is apparent that Nigerian men, including educated men, have an important role in fertility behavior and population growth since they dominate and control many of the structural, behavioral, and cultural dimensions of the process. We recommend that male attitudes and behavior should be included in a complete fertility model in Nigeria and perhaps other nations. A greater involvement of men in future research would provide a realistic and holistic understanding of the roles of men in the reproductive behavior of women in Africa.
In addition, several theoretical and empirical relationships emanate from this study: (1) education and fertility; (2) old age security and fertility; and (3) polygyny and fertility. The applicability of these theoretical and empirical assumptions to men need to be reexamined in the context of Nigeria as well as other African nations.
