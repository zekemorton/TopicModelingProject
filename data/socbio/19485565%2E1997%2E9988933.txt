ABSTRACT: Using data collected from a Native Canadian community by Embree (1993), we examine the influence of personal and family background characteristics on satisfaction with spousal relationships, both legal marriages and cohabitations. Of special interest are the quality of relationships with parents while growing up, alcohol abuse by the parent(s), and the experience of sexual abuse during childhood. Personal traits such as age, sex, and gender role attitudes and the respondent's owndrinking behavior are also considered. Path analytic techniques model both the direct effects of independent variables on relationship satisfaction as well as the role of personal consumption of alcohol as an intervening variable in level of satisfaction with a relationship. Theresults of the analysis indicate that personal consumption of alcohol and the experience of sexual abuse during childhood are the best direct predictors of level of satisfaction with the current relationship, with higher alcohol consumption and experience of sexual abuse related to lower satisfaction. Agealso has a significant direct, though smaller, positive influence on relationship satisfaction. Sexual abuse and the respondent's sex are also linked to level of satisfaction through personal alcohol consumption. With personal alcohol use,both the respondent's sex and the experience of sexual abuse during childhood have a significant effect, with males and those sexually abused as children reporting higher levels of alcohol consumption. The socialization explanation of the intergenerational consequences of parental behavior argues that parental role models are primary to thefuture family formation behavior of children. Consistent with this hypothesis, the findings concerning sexual abuse, in particular, as a predictor of both personal alcohol use and relationship satisfaction seem to underscore the importance of antecedent family characteristics in influencing later adjustment to adult roles and responsibilities.

Research in the area of marriage and family relationships reveals a number of characteristics which may help to explain variations in relationship satisfaction and marital stability. Among these factors are: premarital cohabitation; marital status, age at marriage, and age similarity between partners (Ambert, 1988); premarital conception and/or childbearing (Leslie and Korman, 1985; Thornton, 1991); marital fertility (Wineberg, 1992) and the presence of children from a previous relationship (Cowan and Cowan, 1992; Hobart, 1991); religiosity (Heaton and Pratt, 1990); income and education (Tynes, 1990; Leslie

and Korman, 1985; Weller and Rofe, 1988) and similarity between spousal income and education (McLanahan and Bumpass, 1988); attitudes toward gender relations and women's labor force status (Brayfield, 1992); and duration of the union (White and Booth, 1991). Abuse of drugs and/or alcohol has also been found to have important negative effects on marital stability and satisfaction (Wadsworth et al., 1975).
In addition to these personal and spousal attributes, various characteristics related to the home environment during childhood may also be influential; especially, parental divorce and marital unhap-

piness (Greenberg and Nay, 1982; Glenn and Kramer, 1987; Booth and Edwards, 1989; Amato and Booth, 1991a; Amato and Booth, 1991fc); parental drug or alcohol abuse (Coleman et al., 1980; Windle et al., 1995); the quality of relationship with the parent(s) (Birtchnell, 1993; Willetts-Bloom and Nork, 1992); and the child's experience of sexual abuse or other forms of violence in the family (Carson et al., 1991; Finkelhor et al., 1989; Kessler and Magee, 1994; Mennen and Pearlmutter, 1993; Morrissette, 1994).
The socialization explanation for intergenerational consequences of parental behavior views such background characteristics as potentially important predictors of adult offsprings' successful adjustment to marriage and family roles. Accordingly, parental role models are seen to be key to the future family formation behavior of children, which means that marriage and family quality can be transmitted across generations. It is well known that Natives throughout North America have suffered heavily from social problems such as family violence and child neglect, suicide, and drug and alcohol abuse (see Durst, 1991; Kirmayer, 1994; Morrissette, 1994; Niezen, 1993). Given the unique historical, economic, and cultural conditions encountered by Native populations, and as a necessary step toward effective intervention, the present research aims to access the appropriateness of the socialization model for this group.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
MODEL TO BE TESTED
Specific personal and background characteristics examined in this analysis for their effects on relationship satisfaction

are: the age, sex, and gender role attitudes of the respondent; personal consumption of alcohol; the quality of relationships with parents while growing up; the experience of sexual abuse as a child; and parental alcohol abuse during childhood. Concerning the respondent's personal characteristics, on the basis of past literature age is predicted to be positively and directly related to relationship satisfaction due to presumed greater levels of personal maturity and relationship skills at older ages; age may also be a proxy for relationship duration, a factor which would be selective of stable, more satisfying unions at older ages. Respondent's age may also be related indirectly to relationship satisfaction through the personal consumption of alcohol. At older ages, alcohol consumption is typically lower which would, in turn, predict greater relationship satisfaction. Alcohol overuse or abuse, thus, is expected to be negatively related to relationship happiness. Given males' higher consumption of alcohol, sex is expected to predict indirectly relationship happiness through level of alcohol consumption. Although it may also be argued that relationship dissatisfaction may lead to excessive drinking in some cases, evidence from the present sample on the timing of alcohol use onset indicates that heavier drinkers begin significantly earlier than non-drinkers or light drinkers (at the survey date) and are, therefore, likely to have established drinking patterns prior to forming a long-term union. In the context of this study, then, problem drinking can be viewed more as personal behavior as opposed to a situational response. Gender role attitudes are hypothesized to impact directly on partner satisfaction, with those holding the most egalitarian attitudes enjoying the most satisfying relationships.

As for the family background characteristics, previous research suggests that the experience of sexual abuse relates negatively and directly to relationship satisfaction due to poor emotional and sexual adjustment; and given clinical evidence for a greater risk of substance abuse among children from abusive backgrounds (Singer et al., 1989), sexual abuse may also be indirectly connected to relationship quality through a positive relationship with level of personal alcohol consumption. Parental drinking, furthermore, is expected to relate positively and directly to personal alcohol use due to children's modelling of parental behavior; parental alcohol consumption is also expected to relate negatively and indirectly to relationship satisfaction through alcohol consumption. Finally, the variables measuring quality of relationships with mother and father while growing up are hypothesized to relate positively and directly to relationship satisfaction, and indirectly through their negative association with personal alcohol consumption. Along with parental alcohol abuse, the quality of childhood relationships with mother and father are thought to be positively correlated, and with similar consequences for the quality of the home environment as would be implied by a positive association between drinking problems by the parents.
DATA
The data for this analysis are based on a randomly selected sample gathered by one of the authors (Embree, 1993) of 876 adults from a Canadian Native community. For the purpose of this study, the sample consists of 523 individuals, ages 19 and over, who reported living with a partner at the time of the interview. Some

basic characteristics of this group are as follows: about 28 per cent are male; almost 26 per cent are between ages 19 and 29; 50 per cent are between ages 30 and 49; and 24 per cent are 50 or older. Fortytwo per cent of respondents reported the highest possible level of relationship satisfaction on the given scale measure. Whereas thirty-seven per cent of respondents failed to answer the question on alcohol consumption, a further twenty-one per cent reported having consumed no alcoholic beverages in the 30 days preceding the survey. Almost 42 per cent had a father (or father substitute) with a drinking problem whereas 16 per cent reported a drinking problem by the mother (or mother substitute). Twenty-seven per cent of this subsample also reported being a victim of sexual abuse during childhood, 83 per cent of whom were female.
Some caution is due regarding the accuracy of this sample in view of the large proportion of missing cases, for males in particular, and on the alcohol use question (i.e., likely underestimating actual use). It is well known that use of a random sampling strategy alone cannot guarantee that final response rates will be proportional to representation in the population. The generalizability of this sample to other Native communities may also be limited by the diverse geographical and cultural experiences of reserve residents. (For further information about the survey and sampling procedures, see Embree 1993.
Given the number of missing responses on the alcohol consumption item, it is useful to examine further possible effects of non-response on variables related to consumption. Table 1 presents mean values for all variables in the analysis, for the sample as a whole, as well as according to whether the respondent answered the

question about drinking behavior. Probabilities associated with the appropriate test of statistical significance (F for continuous variables and x2 f°r categorical ones) are also given. As evident from Table 1, the differences in magnitude between the separate group averages for respondents and non-respondents are minimal in all cases, and only with the variables measuring relationship quality with mother, satisfaction with partner relations, and age is the observed difference likely to exist in the larger population of Natives (given the conventional probability criterion of 0.05). The lack of substantive differences according to response status on consumption in average values on all of the other variables in the model demonstrates that sample bias due to non-response on the alcohol consumption question is not an issue.
Multiple linear regression is used to assess first the impact of a variety of personal and family background characteristics on satisfaction with the current partner relationship. A further regression

model identifies significant predictors of personal consumption of alcohol, the intervening variable hypothesized by the model. Path analytic techniques are then used to map out the direct effects of the specified independent variables on relationship satisfaction as well as the role of personal consumption of alcohol as an intervening variable in level of satisfaction with a partner relationship.
The regression models, based as they are on single equations, show the effect of a given independent variable on the dependent variable, with all other variables in the model held constant. They cannot, therefore, reveal or distinguish direct and indirect effects of independent variables on a dependent variable. Path analysis is useful in suggesting causal or dynamic structures which permit examination of a system of relationships between and among variables; it does so by indicating whether the measured statistical associations are consistent with the assumptions made about interrelationships among the variables of interest.

The dependent variable consists of a summated scale based on six items concerning the respondent's subjective evaluation of his or her partner, each with five response categories. This scaled variable is measured at the (quasi)interval level, with high values indicating high satisfaction with the spousal relationship. The alpha reliability coefficient for this variable is 0.92. Since only those individuals currently in unions are included in the analysis, there may be some selectivity in favor of surviving (and presumably more successful) relationships. The dependent variable measures not only the respondent's subjective appraisal of his or her partner, but also reflects the relevant criteria for choosing and staying with a partner with given qualities. Accordingly, to some extent the independent variables in the analysis may be thought of as determinants of the respondent's selection of a partner with given characteristics in addition to one's satisfaction with that partner.
The independent variables in the analysis of relationship satisfaction include the respondent's sex, age and gender role attitudes, personal drinking habits, quality of relationship with the mother and father while growing up, and the experience of sexual abuse as a child. Sex is measured at the nominal level, with females as the reference category. Age is measured in single years at the interval/ ratio level. Gender role attitudes is an interval-type scale variable based on summation of seven items about men's and women's roles, each with five response categories. This variable reflects level of egalitarianism in gender relations, with higher values on this variable meaning more egalitarian attitudes. The alpha coefficient for this variable is 0.70. Personal drinking refers to the number of alcoholic

beverages (beer, wine, or liquor) consumed by the respondent over the 30 days prior to the survey. Quality of relationships with the mother and father (or parental substitute) while growing up are also scale measures based on summation of six items about the quality of relationship with the parent, each with five response levels. The alpha reliability coefficients for quality of relations with mother and father, respectively, are 0.87 and 0.89. Sexual abuse is measured at the nominal level according to whether the respondent was ever abused sexually as a child. Those not experiencing abuse of this nature serve as the reference category. Since the measure of sexual abuse used here does not differentiate between abuse from a family or non-family individual, it must be assumed that the occurrence of sexual abuse generally reflects certain conditions and characteristics of the child's home environment (such as parental competence or involvement with the child) in which the abuse took place.
Bivariate correlatio.n coefficients for all variables used in the multivariate analyses are shown in Table 2. Figure 1 illustrates the path model tested in this study, including the multivariate parameter estimates for all hypothesized relationships between the independent variables and relationship satisfaction and personal alcohol use.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The zero-order correlations of all variables in the path analysis are based on 206 cases obtained through listwise deletion of missing values. Overall, the bivariate correlations are consistent with many of the hypotheses presented earlier about the determinants of satisfaction

with a partner relationship. Age, as expected, is positively and significantly associated with relationship satisfaction (r = 0.180, a == 0.01), as is egalitarian attitude toward gender roles (r = 0.162, a < 0.05). Personal alcohol use also stands out as a significant predictor of relationship happiness (r= -0.254, a < 0.001). Considering the family background characteristics, sexual abuse is significantly and negatively associated with the outcome variable (r = -0.295, a < 0.001), along with drinking problem of the father (r = -0.178, a < 0.01). Mother's drinking problem, however, is not significantly related. Quality of relationship with the mother (r = 0.174, a < 0.01) and the father (r = 0.207, a < 0.01) are each found to be statistically significant.
In contrast to the findings for relationship satisfaction, few of the expected associations with alcohol consumption are apparent from the bivariate analysis. Not surprisingly, sex is a significant predictor of personal drinking habits, with males consuming more alcohol than females (r = 0.184, a < 0.01). Age has a nonsignificant impact on drinking behavior, although the direction of the coefficient is as expected. This finding is somewhat unique in that consumption does not decrease with age as it does in the general population. Turning to the family background characteristics, we see that none of the other hypothesized associations with personal drinking are statistically significant. As predicted by the path model which follows, however, parental drinking problems covary quite strongly and are positively associated (r = 0.415, a < 0.001); quality of relations with the mother and father during childhood are also mutually and significantly related in the expected direction (r = 0.339, a < 0.001).

In addition to these predicted effects, there are certain other notable correlations among the independent variables that relate to family dynamics. The results concerning sexual abuse in particular seem to stand out. For example, females are significantly more likely to be sexually abused as children compared to males (r = 0.135, a < 0.05). The occurrence of sexual abuse is also positively and significantly associated with drinking problems by the mother (r = 0.238, a < 0.001) and the father (r = 0.289, a < 0.001). Sexual abuse also correlates negatively and significantly with quality of relations with the parents (r = 0.227, a < 0.001 for mother relationship and r = -0.135, a < 0.05 for father relationship) which indicates that the more satisfying the relationship with the parent, the lower the likelihood of sexual abuse. The directions of these associations, however, are not perfectly clear. The correlations between parental alcohol abuse and quality of relations with parents are also significant. Mother's drinking problem is negatively correlated with both the quality of mother relationship (r = -0.289, a ^ 0.001) and father relationship (r = -0.150, a < 0.05); father's drinking problem is similarly associated with the quality of relationship with mother (r = -0.287, a < 0.001) and father (r = -0.441, a < 0.001).
Cross-tabular analyses of sexual abuse during childhood with parental drinking problems confirm some important features of the associations just described. In particular, father's alcohol abuse is significantly and clearly associated with the occurrence of sexual abuse. Among the 27 per cent of the sample reporting sexual abuse during childhood, two-thirds had a father with a drinking problem (x2 =

50

27.64, df = 1, p < 0.001). The figures associated with mother's drinking problem are similar, although less dramatic: Of those who weren't abused as children, about 10 per cent had a mother who abused alcohol. This figure compares with 32 per cent of sexually abused respondents whose mother had a drinking problem (x2 = 28.30, df = 1, p < 0.001). Although not conclusive, these preliminary analyses are revealing about the complex of factors which may characterize family life and, according to the socialization model, also be transmitted across generations via parental modelling.
The path analysis in Figure 1 shows standardized beta coefficients (P) for all paths linking the independent variables with alcohol use and relationship satisfaction. The figure shows that age is significantly and positively related to relationship satisfaction (P = 0.158, a < 0.01). As noted earlier, greater levels of satisfaction at older ages may be due, in part, to an overrepresentation of respondents with more durable (and thus presumably more satisfying) relationships. However, since a measure of union duration was not available from the data, this possible explanation cannot be confirmed.
The only other significant direct effects on relationship satisfaction are for personal alcohol use ((3 = -0.222, a < 0.001) and sexual abuse (P = -0.227, a £ 0.001). Further analysis of the relationship between consumption and relationship satisfaction reveals a clear linear trend. Dividing the sample on the relationship satisfaction variable into approximate thirds, the mean consumption levels according to satisfaction are 31 drinks monthly for those expressing the most satisfying relations; 37 drinks for those with moderate levels of satisfaction, and

63 drinks on average for those with the lowest level of relationship satisfaction. The effect of respondent's sex is indirect through a positive association with personal drinking ((3 = 0.223, a < 0.01). Sexual abuse is also linked to relationship satisfaction through its significant association with personal alcohol consumption (P = 0.176, a < 0.05). Here, the emergence of a significant effect in the multivariate context indicates the presence of a suppressor variable. Additional analysis on this question reveals a significant interaction between sex and sexual victimization in childhood, and shows that the original bivariate relationship between sexual abuse and drinking behavior had been suppressed by the absence of a control for respondent's sex. Specifically, the effect of sexual abuse on consumption patterns, while non-significant for females, is quite strongly positive and significant for males p = 0.325, a < 0.01). This result, while requiring further investigation, appears to point to notable sex differences in strategies for coping with the stress and trauma of sexual abuse (see Windle et al., 1995 for clinical evidence to this effect).
It is also important to note in the context of this discussion that the sexual abuse item used in this study appears to measure the real extent of the problem in this Native community. Given evidence from the data that the drinking patterns of non-abused respondents and nonrespondents are similar (i.e., later onset of drinking for both of these groups compared to the known abused group), it may be inferred that non-respondents on the sexual abuse question were unlikely to have been victimized. None of the other variables measuring family background quality are significantly related to rela-

tionship satisfaction, either directly or through alcohol consumption. In discussing the bivariate results, however, it was noted that mother's and father's drinking problems correlate significantly, as is the case with the quality of relations with mother and father while growing up.
Many of the hypotheses tested in this study involving family background, personal drinking behavior, and relationship satisfaction are based on theory and findings about non-Native populations. Evident differences, then, in patterns of results obtained for this Native population seem to confirm the social and cultural uniqueness of this group, quite apart from well-documented demographic differences in fertility and mortality. For example, while alcohol consumption generally declines over the life course (Addiction Research Foundation, 1983), this pattern does not appear to hold true for the Native population studied here where the multivariate results show no significant association between age and consumption.
Such differences aside, one very useful finding which does emerge after controlling for the effects of all of the other family background characteristics involves the significant role of sexual abuse. Due to the extremely sensitive nature of the topic and especially when it involves incest, sexual abuse is a problem which is seriously understudied. In many cases, sexual abuse in childhood can be seen to reflect the failure of the family system to regulate sexual activity in the interest of the child. Consistent with recent research on the relationship between childhood physical and sexual victimization and adult mental disorders (see Windie et al., 1995), the bivariate analysis in this study found a significant and fairly strong association between the occurrence

of sexual abuse and parental abuse of alcohol. Such a finding helps to underscore the interrelatedness of various conditions and features of family life, some of which may be more prevalent in, but certainly not specific to, Native populations.
The consequences of childhood sexual abuse may be devastating in both the short term and the long run. Recent work on the subject of long-term effects of sexual abuse demonstrates a positive correlation between childhood sexual abuse involving penetration and marital disruption as well as dissatisfaction with one's sexual relationship (see Finkelhor, 1989). Related research also reveals a close association between victims' families of origin characteristics and characteristics of their families of procreation (Carson et al., 1991). Romans et al. (1995) report that sexual abuse in childhood is associated with later incidents of deliberate selfharm and with becoming involved in further abusive relationships as an adult. The occurrence of sexual abuse, therefore, may be regarded not only as a serious problem from the perspective of the victim but can also be interpreted as the failure of the family system to meet its members' primary needs. This failure in family functioning ultimately undermines victims' ability to adjust successfully to adult roles and responsibilities later in life. In view of these possible linkages, the present study has attempted to demonstrate an association between the occurrence of sexual abuse and satisfaction with one's partner relationship, both directly and though its impact on personal alcohol use. These associations were supported by data which show a significant positive effect of sexual abuse on personal alcohol consumption and a negative direct impact on relationship satisfaction. The

results involving sexual abuse thus support the socialization model regarding the intergenerational transmission of family quality.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH DIRECTIONS
A number of important issues have been raised by this investigation. One concerns the sample size used for the analysis. Thirty-seven per cent of the original 523 cases (193 respondents) failed to answer the question on personal alcohol use. The non-response rate on this variable, thus, is fairly high, most likely due to the sensitive nature of this question, especially for Natives. Given the number of missing cases on the alcohol consumption variable, the use of listwise deletion resulted in a relatively small final sample size. Nevertheless, given the theoretical and empirical importance attached to alcohol consumption for both non-Native and Native populations in explaining patterns of family life, it was essential to retain this variable in the analysis. Moreover, given the likely reason for non-response (i.e., stigma associated with alcohol use and abuse among Natives), the sample used in the present study is most likely selective of non-drinkers or moderate drinkers, which may actually afford a conservative test of the relationship between personal alcohol use and relationship satisfaction. As determined above, further analysis of the non-responding subset of cases on the drinking behavior question revealed that differences in the characteristics of respondents and non-respondents were negligible.
A further issue is that of the importance of proper temporal sequencing of

the hypothesized causal processes. Given the retrospective nature of much of the data, a major strength of this study lies in specifying many of the relationships based on proper time sequencing of the variables of interest. This factor is especially important in attempting to attribute alcohol use and relationship quality during adulthood to earlier characteristics and events of the home environment during childhood. Additionally, the use of path analysis which is based on assumptions about proper causal ordering among the variables proved to be particularly appropriate for examining the role of alcohol consumption in the association between background characteristics and relationship satisfaction. Notwithstanding the strengths of this approach, it must be remembered that effects are only inferred and all causal conclusions, therefore, must be treated tentatively.
Future research on the determinants of relationship quality may benefit from distinguishing between married and cohabiting partners in order to see whether there are differences for these two groups in the predictors of satisfaction. A comparison of those currently in a union with those who are not might also reveal the extent to which the various independent variables predict the tendency to divorce of persons in less than satisfactory marriages. Since unsatisfactory relationships are more likely to dissolve than satisfactory ones, the determinants of marital satisfaction may be different for the two groups. This approach would reduce the selectivity of the sample and allow the researcher to say something about the more general determinants of relationship satisfaction. The possibility of a spurious association between features of the family of orientation and satisfaction with the
