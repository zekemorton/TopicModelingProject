ABSTRACT: Male and female students were asked to select from groups of photographs projected on slides the individual preferred as a mate in a long-term husband-wife relationship. The students were later shown some of the same photographs several times to familiarize them with these individuals. The students were subsequently shown the same groups of photographs from which they initially indicated mating preferences and were again asked to indicate their preferences. When familiarization immediately preceded the final preference selections, both male and female students switched preferences and chose individuals with whom they had been familiarized approximately twice as often as they switched preferences and chose individuals with whom they had not been familiarized. When familiarization preceded the final preference selection by seven days, the frequency of switching and choosing the familiar type did not increase. These results and the possible evolutionary basis for the results are discussed.

Many proposals have been made to account for why an individual selects a particular person as a mate. Some proposals are quite complex. Klimek (1979), for example, suggests that the basic personality is established during the early years of life and is developed by the conscious and unconscious interaction with the first significant human, usually the mother. The quality of this relationship, he adds, becomes the prototype for all other intimate relationships. As this first relationship is renounced during adolescence, definite unconscious preferences, attractions, and revulsions emerge towards "types" of people.
Some hold to a Freudian point of view and suggest that individuals may seek as marital partners those persons who resemble their opposite-sex parents; that is, a man will seek as a wife someone who resembles in appearance

his mother, whereas a woman will seek as a husband someone who resembles her father (Duck and Miell, 1983). Others suggest that people carry in their minds some impression of their own attractiveness to others and that they seek as mates someone who falls within their own level of attractiveness (Berscheid and Walster, 1974). There are some who suggest that preferences are based on the notion that opposites attract, while others insist that we are attracted to those very similar to us (Mullan, 1984; Buss, 1985).
Like many other complex types of behavior, the basis for mating preferences seems to develop early in life. A proposal by Westermarck (1891) to account for incest avoidance in humans focuses on this critical period of early development. He suggests that an aversion to mating arises between people reared together during childhood and that this

familiarization is the means by which human populations avoid inbreeding and its associated deleterious effects. Studies involving Israeli kibbutzim (Shepher, 1971) and sim-pua marriages in Taiwan (Wolf, 1966) lend support to this proposal and indicate that the critical period of familiarization occurs between the ages of two to six (van den Berghe, 1983).
The effects of early familiarization on mating have also been studied in organisms other than man. Some of these studies tend to support the idea that a mating aversion exists toward those with whom the individual was familiarized early in life. Studies by Bateson (1978) with Japanese quail, for example, have shown that both males and females prefer to associate (and assumedly mate) with those individuals of the opposite sex they had not seen during rearing in preference to those they had.
Other studies involving crossfostering also show that early familiarization influences mating and mate choice. Studies with ducks (Schutz, 1965), quail (Gallagher, 1977), finches (Immelmann et al., 1978), and doves and pigeons (Warriner et al., 1963; Brosset, 1971), for example, show that these birds develop increased preference for members of a related species or color variant when they are raised by this species or color variant. Much the same has been found in studies involving a variety of rodents (D'udine and Aller, 1983). Apparently, normal nonmanipulated rearing acts to establish mate preferences and therefore set reproductive limits in these species.
A study by Cato and Mug (1984) suggests that the effect of the early familiarization can diminish with time. They found that mate preferences for the rearing type in zebra finches decreased

as a period of isolation between rearing and mate preference testing increased. Since the effects of early familiarization can apparently diminish, it seems reasonable that these effects might be reinforced by familiarization later in life.
In humans where the capacity for learning throughout life is so great and the life span prior to mating is so long, it is reasonable that contacts later in life might influence mating preferences. Therefore, it seems reasonable that late familiarization (through repeated social contact) could act to reinforce aversions or preferences established early in life, or that late familiarization could initiate new mating preferences.
The present study was undertaken to ascertain whether late familiarization does in fact affect human mating preferences. Students were asked to select from photographs displayed on each of an initial series of projected slides the individual preferred as a mate in a longterm relationship. They were subsequently shown some of the same photographs on another series of slides used to familiarize them with selected individuals. After being familiarized and one week after first indicating mating preferences, the students were shown slides displaying the same groups of photographs that were used initially. From these slides they were again asked to indicate their mate preferences. Data was then analyzed to determine whether the familiarization increased or decreased the rate at which individuals were selected as preferred mates.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Male and female college students from ten sections of an introductory biology class were separated by sex and shown sets of slides displaying colored

lowed, slides Dl and El. Slide Dl was produced by randomly selecting and using three of the six photographs. Slide El was produced using the other three. These and all slides used for ranking randomly assigned the photographs to positions in a single row of three.
Another three slides dealing with ranking followed. The first was similar to the previous informational slide, only it asked the students to rank the individuals on each of the next two slides according to perceived sociability (most to least). The following two slides, slides Fl and Gl, were produced using the same six photographs used on slides Dl and El. Slide Fl was produced after randomly selecting a new and unique group of three from the six photographs. Slide Gl wasproduced from the remaining three.
Three more slides involved with ranking followed. The first was again informational and was similar to others preceding it except that it asked the students to rank the individuals on each of the next two slides according to perceived aggressiveness (most to least). The following slides, slides HI and II, were produced using the same six photographs used on slides Dl and El. Slide HI was produced by again randomly selecting a new and unique group of three from the six photographs, and slide II was produced from the remaining three.
The last four slides again dealt with mate preferences. The first of these slides provided the same instructions concerning mate selection as the instructional slide preceding slides Al-Cl. The three following slides, slides Jl-Ll, displayed the photographs of twelve new individuals, with four photographs per slide.
The general composition of the slide

sets shown to students a week later isdescribed below. The set shown specifically to the males is represented graphically in Figure 2.
The second sets of slides were similar to the first. They began with three slides containing general instructions similar to those on the first slide sets except that the students were informed that this was the second and last phase of the study they began a week ago and that they would be ranking individuals in this phase according to potential for academic success, leadership, and athletic ability.
The next four slides dealt with mate preferences. The first of these slides was instructional, again asking students to select the individual they would prefer as their mate in a long-term husbandwife relationship. The three following slides, slides A2-C2, displayed the same photographs respectively as slides A l Cl, although new positions for each of the photographs on each slide were randomly assigned.
The next three slides involved ranking. The first was similar to those used a week earlier, although it asked that the ranking be based on perceived potential for academic success. Two photographs from each of the last three slides of the firstset, slides Jl-Ll, were randomly selected for use in producing the next two slides, slides D2 and E2. These slides were produced using the same criteria used to produce slides Dl and El.
Another three slides dealing with ranking followed. The first was similar to the preceding instructional slide, although it asked that the ranking be based on perceived potential for leadership. The following two slides, slides F2 and G2, were produced from the same six photographs used on slides D2 and

Exposure to the photographs shown on the J, K, and L slides occurred using ranking slides shown just prior to the final mate preference selections.
The frequency of switching to different photographs on mate preference slides shown after familiarization by stu-

As can be seen from this table, there is a tendency for switching to occur more frequently when the prefamiliarization selections were nonfamiliar photographs.

dent for photographs in the J-L slide group. From 260 nonfamiliar selections by male students on these slides, 137 switches (52.7 per cent) occurred. This number is significantly greater (P < 0.01) than the 95switches (39.9 per cent) which occurred from 238 familiar selections. Similarly, there was a significantly greater rate (P<0.01) of switching from the nonfamiliar photographs selected prior to familiarization from the J-L slides shown to the females. From 269 nonfamiliar selections, 135 switches (50.2 per cent) occurred, whereas 117 switches (39.3 per cent) occurred from 298familiar type selections.
The tendency for switching to occur more frequently when the prefamiliarization selections were nonfamiliar photographs was also evident in the A-C slides viewed by males. The 114 (45.2 per cent) switches which occurred from the 252 nonfamiliar selections were significantly greater (P < 0.01) than the 79 switches (32.1 per cent) from the 246

familiar selections. This increased rate of switching from the nonfamiliar selections did not occur, however, in the A C slides seen by the female students. From 311 nonfamiliar selections on the prefamiliarization slides, 120 (38.9 per cent) switches occurred. This number is actually somewhat less frequent than occurred with the familiar selections, where 100 (39.1 per cent) switches took place from 256 selections.
The number of times students switched their selection from one photograph to another on each of the mate preference slides, the numbers of times the switches were to familiar and nonfamiliar photographs, and the numbers of times switches to familiar and nonfamiliar photographs were expected, are given in Table 4 (for male students) and Table 5 (for female students).

character differences (Duck and Miell, 1983). Perhaps a considerable amount of character evaluation occurred during the evaluation of the photographs in this study.
The extent of switching and selecting a familiar rather than a nonfamiliar photograph was somewhat surprising. Among the groups of photographs shown to females immediately after familiarization, familiar photographs were selected 22 per cent more frequently than would be expected if the familiarization had had no effect. The comparable figure among the males was 33 per cent (see Figure 3). Considering these figures, it is also a bit surprising that no increase occurred when familiarization preceded final mate preference selection by a week. These findings seem to indicate that while preferences can easily change, the factors contributing to the rationale responsible for the change are easily forgotten.
There is no doubt that factors influencing mate choice are critical to evolutionary survival. It is reasonable that late familiarization is a means by which an individual can better evaluate potential mates. As an individual becomes better known, doubts about that individual's ability to contribute to the relationship and to the survival of potential offspring would diminish. Survival of the genetic line, it seems reasonable to suggest, is too critical to entrust to an unknown or little-known potential mate.
The findings of this study can be reconciled with the ideas inherent in the "inbreeding avoidance" hypothesis. It is reasonable that if it is important to avoid

mating with close relatives, the time to develop mating aversions would be when contacts with relatives exceed contracts with acceptable or desirable potential mates. This would be the period of infancy and early childhood. Since the interval of time between the establishment of such aversive behavior and actual mating is so long, such behavior would be expected to be somewhat permanently ingrained. It also seems reasonable that the time to develop strong preferences is when encounters with relatives are less likely and encounters with desirable mates are more likely to occur. This would be the time of adolescence or of life as a young adult. Since mating can occur soon after such encounters, there is no need for these preferences to be continuously maintained.
Thus, a system based on long-term avoidance behavior which is established early in life and on short-term preferences arising much later in life seems quite feasible. It would certainly be appropriate in a species like man where family contacts are maintained to some extent throughout much of life, where a tremendous capacity to learn exists, and where there is considerable mobility among those who are sexually mature. Such a system would not only tend to avoid the undesirable effects of inbreeding, but would promote outbreeding and would thereby increase genetic variability within the population.
