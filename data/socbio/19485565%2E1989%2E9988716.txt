ABSTRACT: Fetal loss has generally been found to vary with gravidity, previous experience of fetal loss, and maternal age, but the literature is divided on the reasons for these associations. In this paper we examine pregnancy histories obtained retrospectively from a nationally representative one-in-one-thousand sample of women in Australia aged 20 to 59 years. The relations of fetal loss ratios with both gravidity and previous outcome are consistent with heterogeneity of risk over the study population and a stopping rule, whereby high-risk women undertake more pregnancies than low-risk women to achieve the same number of live births. Evidence is presented that elevated loss ratios in the teens indicate not higher risk but a selection for short gestation intervals, while loss ratios beyond the mid-thirties do not point unequivocally to a substantial increase in risk at the older reproductive ages.

such as abortion, particularly induced abortion, in an interview from which no health-related benefit can be expected than they would in a clinic-based study where such information can be viewed as part of their medical history (World Health Organization, 1970, pp. 12-14).
Retrospective surveys have indeed not been uniformly successful in recording pregnancy wastage. The median proportion of pregnancies terminating in a nonlive birth in 39 developing countries which participated in the World Fertility Survey was only 7 per cent. Levels no higher than 5per cent were recorded in one-quarter of the surveys, while levels of at least 15 per cent were recorded only in three, and then only because they were inflated by induced abortion (Chidambaram et al., 1980, p. 25; Casterline, 1988). Surveys have, however, been more successful outside the Third World. Spontaneous fetal loss accounted for 13 per cent of the pregnancies of a sample of women doctors in the United Kingdom (Roman, 1984, p. 30) and for 17per cent and 13per cent of the pregnancies of two cohorts of women in a prospective study initiated in 1935 (Wilcox et al., 1981,p. 549).
The data on which this paper is based come from a recent national singleround retrospective survey of women conducted in Australia. We examine the bases of the observed relationships of pregnancy loss with gravidity and with maternal age.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The Australian Family Project conducted a national sample survey of onein-one-thousand households in Australia in 1986-87, interviewing 2,547 women aged 20-59 years. A primary aim of the Project was to examine the

recent declines in marriage and fertility in Australia, and the heart of the questionnaire was a series of life histories relating to marriages and consensual unions, childbearing, use of contraception and labor-force participation (Bracher, 1987).
The questionnaire was designed to simulate, as far as possible, a structured conversation. Great pains were taken, therefore, to ensure a logical and natural sequence of questions. The section on childbearing closed with questions about plans for more children or, if appropriate, the reason why the respondent had stopped childbearing. A question on pregnancy wastage followed, and led into a block of questions designed to discover any fecundity impairments and thus to throw light both on childbearing and on contraceptive use, and then into a complete contraceptive history.
The question on fetal loss was designed to elicit the number and type of pregnancy losses experienced by each respondent and their timing relative to first marriage and live births. The question was carefully worded so as not to suggest that we were probing for induced abortions, the legality of which is recent in Australia relative to the reproductive lifetimes of many of the respondents and also differs between states. At training sessions interviewers typically asked whether the question was really about induced abortions, and we were at pains to stress that spontaneous losses were actually more common. No respondent refused explicitly to answer this question, nor was any loss reported without an indication of the birth interval into which it fell.
Nearly 30 per cent of interviewed women had experienced a fetal death. Of the 6,213 pregnancies reported in the

study 1.1 per cent ended in stillbirth, 14.0 per cent in spontaneous abortion, and 2.9 per cent in induced abortion. The overall level of spontaneous fetal death agrees extremely well with levels from the best studies conducted elsewhere. The data on late fetal death are also of the right order of magnitude although comparisons with official statistics are hampered by interstate differences in registration practice and definition, and by the fact that pregnancies reported in the survey did not necessarily terminate in Australia. Nevertheless, women aged 50-59, for example, whose pregnancies were centered around the late 1950's, reported a ratio of 19 stillbirths to 1,000 live births plus stillbirths, while published stillbirth ratios for Australia in the 1950's and 1960's range from 18down to 12 (United Nations, 1970). Similarly, a stillbirth ratio between 1981and 1986 of 9per 1,000 live births and stillbirths accords well with published ratios of between six and eight (Australian Bureau of Statistics, 1986).
In the following analyses we follow the practice of Leridon (1976) and Roman (1984) in grouping all spontaneous fetal deaths, since "stillbirth" and "miscarriage" were distinguished in the questionnaire simply to mirror acceptable colloquial usage. We deal with multiple births by defining parity as the number of live confinements rather than the number of live births. Ectopic pregnancies were explicitly distinguished from other spontaneous or induced losses in only 0.14 per cent of pregnancies although the expected proportion is about 0.4 per cent (Llewellyn-Jones, 1982, p. 196; Pharaoh et al., 1977, p. 34). We thus make no attempt to exclude such pregnancies although other studies have done so, where possible,

because of their different etiology (Roman, 1984). They are in any case so rare that their inclusion will not significantly alter our findings.
The induced abortion data are the hardest to assess. Abortion is now available virtually on demand in New South Wales and Victoria, which contain three-fifths of the country's population, but not in the other states (Yusuf and Briggs, 1985). Official abortion statistics are available only for South Australia, and only since 1970, when legislation was amended there. For the last ten years or so that state has registered 17 induced abortions for 100 live births (Hart and MacHarper, 1987, p. 200). Our survey data suggest a national incidence of induced abortion over the last decade of only one-third this level, although the age pattern resembles South Australia's in that the highest ratios, between three and four times the overall ratio, pertain to the recent pregnancies of teenagers and women over 40.
While it would be incorrect to extrapolate from South Australia to the country as a whole, it is likely that some induced abortions were probably not reported. Yet this underreporting may not be a serious problem. Our focus is on spontaneous losses, and recent studies have been singularly unsuccessful in demonstrating that the risk of spontaneous loss is elevated by a previous induced abortion (Chung et al., 1982;Hogue et al., 1982; Chung et al., 1983).
Even with perfect reporting, induced abortion is a nuisance factor in a study of spontaneous abortion because of competing risks. Some pregnancies that are deliberately aborted would have miscarried anyway; and some pregnancies miscarry while induced abortion is being contemplated. Thus, the higher the proportion of pregnancies ending in in-

duced abortion, the lower the proportion ending in spontaneous abortion: for example, when 37 per cent of pregnancies in Hungary terminated in induced abortion only 8 per cent terminated in spontaneous abortion (Czeizel et al., 1984). This competition must be taken into account when assessing the true risk of spontaneous abortion (Susser, 1983; Olsen, 1984).
Some analyses of spontaneous fetal death simply exclude women who report an induced abortion (Leridon, 1976; Roman, 1984). The logic of excluding earlier events on the basis of later behavior is doubtful, particularly when incomplete pregnancy histories are not excluded from analysis. Other analyses exclude just those pregnancies that terminate in induced abortion (Pharaoh et al., 1977; Wilcox et al., 1981). This precludes analysis on the basis of earlier outcomes particularly in light of the problem of competing risks. In our study, for example, as many as 30 per cent of pregnancies occurring after an induced abortion were terminated by a second or higher-order abortion, and thus as few as 5 per cent ended in spontaneous fetal death. A third approach, and the one followed here, is to censor pregnancy histories at the first induced abortion. This approach retains preabortion data, excludes post-abortion data, and retains unbroken pregnancy histories for sequential analysis.
Some preparatory work was necessary to determine ages at fetal death. Dates of fetal loss were not sought directly, although interviewers were instructed to note any date volunteered by the respondent or any more general comment related to the timing of a fetal death. In the absence of such information each fetal loss could be located within an interval defined by the earliest

and latest dates at which the loss could have occurred, related, for example, to previous or subsequent pregnancies, sterilization, or menopause.
The upper and lower limits of the timing of 32 per cent of fetal losses lay within the same five-year age group. An examination of interviewers' jottings established dates for a further 36 per cent of losses, one-third being in the form of month and year and two-thirds in the form of year only. Dates of the remaining 32 per cent of fetal losses were then randomly imputed over the possible interval. The age distributions of losses with known dates and of losses with imputed dates did not differ significantly.
RESULTS
GRAVIDITY AND MATERNAL AGE
Many studies have demonstrated that pregnancy loss ratios rise with gravidity. Of eleven studies cited by Leridon (1977, pp. 64-66), for example, the study with the median loss ratio (15 per cent) exhibited a loss ratio at the first pregnancy of 13 per cent, and at pregnancy orders 6+ of 19 per cent. In these, and other studies, loss ratios tended to rise markedly only at the third or fourth pregnancy, rather than linearly (see also Roman, 1984, p. 30).
A more complex relation has been observed between pregnancy loss ratios and maternal age. While ratios tend to rise with age, particularly from the midthirties, they are sometimes higher in the teens than the twenties. For example, five of Leridon's eleven studies exhibited higher loss ratios in the teens than at ages 20-24, and four of these five studies had higher loss ratios in the teens than at ages 25-29 (Leridon, 1977, p. 63). One study showed a proportion of pregnancies terminating in spontaneous

abortion before age 25 (24 per cent) so high that it was exceeded only by the proportion terminating at age 40 or above (34 per cent) (Pharaoh et al., 1977, p. 35).
Univariate tabulations are not completely informative, however, because gravidity is correlated with maternal age. Cross-classification by pregnancy order typically exaggerates the J- or Ushaped pattern with age, or reveals such a pattern at the higher orders. Danish data cited by Nortman (1974, p. 24), for example, show loss ratios falling from 10 per cent to 9 per cent between the teens and early twenties. Comparable ratios for the first and second pregnancies were not differentiated by age, but for the third pregnancy were respectively 16 and 8 per cent.
The proportion of pregnancies terminating spontaneously in fetal death in the Australian Family Project is tabulated by pregnancy order and age at termination in Table 1. While the loss ratios exceed many of those cited above they show similar patterns with age and gravidity, namely, increases with pregnancy order both within age groups and overall, and a J-shape with age which is exaggerated at the higher pregnancy orders. We will deal with the gravidity and age effects in turn.
WHAT CAUSES THE RELATIONWITH
GRAVIDITY?
Increases in loss ratios within each age group with pregnancy order once encouraged the belief that individual risk increased with each pregnancy (Warburton and Fraser, 1964; Naylor, 1974; discussion in Kline, 1978). This belief was challenged by James as long ago as 1963, and more recent work has indeed failed to find a direct association

at the individual level between the risk of spontaneous loss and gravidity (Kline etal.,1978).
A number of studies have shown that the proportion of fetal deaths at each gravidity increases with previous experience of fetal death (Warburton and Fraser, 1964; Leridon, 1977; Yudkin and Baras, 1983; Strobino et al., 1986). Table 2, which tabulates loss ratios by sequences of outcomes, O representing a live birth and X a fetal loss, indicates that this pattern is observable also in our data. It is immediately clear that risk does not rise simply with gravidity since, for example, the proportions of second and third pregnancies terminating in the first fetal loss (12 and 14 per cent) differ little from the proportion of first pregnancies (13 per cent).
Two possible mechanisms have been suggested for the increase in loss ratios with previous experience, and either

would lead to an apparent relation with gravidity. The first, the "recurrence risk" hypothesis, postulates that a woman's biological risk of another fetal death increases not with each pregnancy, but with each fetal death. Kline (1978, p. 340-342), using a simple model in which the probability of fetal death was constant with age and gravidity but rose from 0.15 to 0.24 after the first fetal death, showed that the recurrences risk hypothesis implies a simple rise in loss ratios with gravidity. Yet the postulated etiology of this mechanism, which is related to maternal responses to fetal or maternal antigens, is obscure (Wilcox and Gladen, 1982, p. 168).
The second, and simpler, hypothesis posits heterogeneous risk, according to which women vary with respect to their innate risk of pregnancy loss, and selective fertility, whereby subsequent childbearing is not independent of earlier

outcomes. It is suggestive, although not conclusive, that Wilcox and Gladen (1982) were able to simulate gravidity effects as large as those observed in real data using a model in which the occurrence of spontaneous abortion was determined primarily by heterogeneous risk and selective fertility. Except in one respect, to which we shall return later, our data are in excellent agreement with their simulation. In both, an overall gravidity effect disappears when attention is restricted to pregnancies preceded only by successful outcomes. Moreover, in our data the proportion of pregnancies terminating in a loss of a particular order tends to decline with gravidity: for example, the proportion of pregnancies terminating in a second fetal death falls from 29 per cent at the second pregnancy to 21 per cent at the third. This is compatible with the notion of heterogeneous risk since a greater number of previous live births indicates membership of a subgroup with lower risk (just as a higher number of previous losses indicates higher risk). In contrast, the recurrence-risk hypothesis predicts that order-specific loss ratios should remain constant with increasing gravidity since risk rises only with the experience of a loss. Whatever the correct explanation, previous experience of fetal death is clearly a very strong predictor of pregnancy outcome and istherefore incorporated into all following analyses.
Wilcox and Gladen (1982) noted that heterogeneity could not of itself produce an overall gravidity effect, but only in combination with selective fertility. They argued that high-risk women are overrepresented at the higher gravidities since they must undertake more pregnancies than low-risk women to achieve the same number of living children. In effect, what changes from one

pregnancy order to the next is not the risk for individual women, but their distribution according to risk.
Our data show strong patterns of progression to the next pregnancy order on the basis of the previous outcome. There is little differentiation after the first pregnancy because the one-child family is relatively uncommon in Australia. Thus, 84 per cent of women with a live birth and 87 per cent of women with a fetal loss undertook a second pregnancy. However, the picture is quite different from the second pregnancy onward. Eighty per cent of women who still had no live birth after two pregnancies undertook a third pregnancy and 89 per cent of women who had only one; but only 58 per cent of women with two live births undertook a third pregnancy. The pattern becomes progressively more distinct at each successive pregnancy order, with continuation rates rising both with the number of previous fetal losses and the more recent the last fetal loss is in the sequence of previous reproductive outcomes.
Low-risk women are thus progressively filtered out of the population as gravidity increases because they achieve their reproductive goals with fewer pregnancies, on average, than high-risk women. The disaggregation of the sample is neatly demonstrated in Table 3 in which fetal loss ratios at given pregnancy orders, controlling for the number of previous losses, rise monotonically as the sample is progressively restricted according to the minimum gravidity attained. For example, after a firstsuccessful pregnancy, those women who conceived again lost, on average, 12.1 per cent of their second pregnancies; but women who subsequently progressed to a third pregnancy had lost 17.8 per cent of their second pregnan-

cies, while women who ultimately undertook at least five pregnancies had lost 22.9 per cent of their second pregnancies. Moreover, the tendency for loss ratios of a particular order to decline with gravidity is maintained within each subset of the sample defined by minimum gravidity.
We move now to a formal test that the Australian Family Project fetal loss data are consistent with heterogeneous risk and selective fertility. Following the lead of Sheps and Menken (1973) and London (1977), we propose a model according to which the risk of fetal loss is distributed over the population as a Beta distribution. It is then possible to derive an expression for the number of women who have / losses in j pregnancies with a given sequence of pregnancy outcomes, there being jQ different sequences for these women (Leridon 1978). The expression is a function of i and/ and the parameters of the Beta distribution, a and b.

The model posits that at each gravidity the distribution of women according to the sequence of live births and losses is a function of the parameters a and b, and the fitting procedure will therefore be disturbed by the dependence of continuation rates on previous history and immediate pregnancy outcome. To remove this dependence, we applied the overall continuation rate observed between successive gravidities to the distribution of women according to their precise sequence of pregnancy outcomes. Weighted numbers of losses and live births at the next higher gravidity were then derived by applying the observed loss ratios to the weighted numbers of women. Both the total number of women at each gravidity and the loss ratios were therefore preserved, but the distribution of outcomes at each gravidity was a function solely of the loss ratios at that and each previous gravidity. The weighted observed distributions were fitted to the expected distributions over

Table 4 summarizes the characteristics of the best-fitting model, showing weighted numbers at risk at each gravidity and by previous number of losses, observed and predicted loss ratios, and chi-squared test statistics at each gravidity and overall. The fit is excellent and indicates that risk is distributed over the study population with a mean of 0.144, a variance of 0.0144, and a median of 0.11. Ten per cent of the sample have a risk less than 0.02 and 10 per cent a risk greater than 0.31.
The extreme skewness of the distribution is illustrated graphically in Figure 1. We show also the distribution of risk amongst the subpopulations that undertook at least three pregnancies, and at

least four pregnancies.1 Naturally, in these two cases no adjustment for differential continuation rates was necessary. With means risks of 0.183 and 0.217, respectively, the distributions demonstrate the increasing disaggregation of the sample according to risk as gravidity increases: 10per cent of women who undertake at least three pregnancies have an innate risk exceeding 0.35, but 10per cent of those who undertake at least four have a risk exceeding 0.44.
The answer to the question posed at the beginning of this section is thus clear. Our data are consistent with the notion of heterogeneous risk and selec-

death at the second pregnancy falling from 0.27 at ages 15-19 to 0.13 at ages 20-24, to 0.11 at ages 25-29, and to 0.09 at ages 30-34. The constant risk simulation produced comparable loss ratios of 0.30,0.14,0.14, and 0.09, and the heterogeneous risk simulation, 0.29, 0.14, 0.14, and 0.08.
It is thus unnecessary, or even inadvisable, to posit higher innate risk of fetal death at the youngest ages on the evidence of loss ratios alone. In her influential literature review on the effect of parental age on pregnancy outcome and child survival, Nortman (1974) concluded that biology poses "a persistent U- or J-shaped irreducible minimum of reproductive risk with respect to age" (p. 4) and that ages of childbearing should therefore be voluntarily restricted. Our findings challenge this statement, at least in the case of fetal death, since pregnant teenagers are not at demonstrably greater risk of fetal loss than women in their twenties with the same previous sequences of reproductive outcomes. Since the artifact is produced by limited exposure, loss ratios will tend to be spuriously elevated in the age group in which women are first exposed to the risk of conception if many women are exposed for only a short time within that age group.
However studies may disagree about teenage risk, they concur in finding an increase in the risk of fetal death for pregnant women from the mid-thirties on. The loss ratios in the Family Project data likewise tend to jump between ages 30-34 and 35-49, although this is not the case for every gravidity and experience group. The problem is that the effect of limited exposure at the youngest ages has an obverse side at the oldest ages, namely, that terminations at the oldest ages are more likely to be associated with longer confinement intervals

and are thus less likely to be fetal deaths. Given that this effect dampens any real age-related rise in risk, the observed increases in the loss ratios are impressive and undoubtedly reflect a real effect of maternal age at least from age 35. Whether risk actually begins to rise in the early thirties is impossible to judge.
We mentioned earlier that the pattern of loss ratios simulated by Wilcox and Gladen (1982) differed from our own in one respect, in that our orderspecific loss ratios tend to decline with gravidity, whereas theirs tended to remain constant. For example, in one of their simulations, the proportions of second, third, and fourth pregnancies ending in a second fetal death were 27, 26, and 26 per cent respectively; in the other, the proportions actually rose, from 19 to 21 and to 23 per cent (Wilcox and Gladen, 1982, p. 169). Comparable observed proportions as presented in the final column of Table 3, are 29, 21, and 21 per cent and 18 per cent at the fifthpregnancy. The declining pattern is consistent with heterogeneous risk and, indeed, is demonstrated also in our own simulation (lowest panel of Table 5), in our predicted loss ratios (Table 4), and in other data (Wilcox and Gladen, 1982, p. 169).
The cause of this disparity seems to be Wilcox and Gladen's explicit quantification of an effect of maternal age. A woman assigned the mean risk of 0.11 at age 20, for example, had a risk of 0.15 at age 30 and 0.33 at age 40. Since age increases with gravidity, this increase apparently offsets the expected declines in simulated order-specific loss ratios.
Yet, with no allowance for a maternal age effect, our predicted loss ratios sit very close to the observed values. Moreover, similar loss ratios were predicted when reproductive histories were censored at age 30. Admittedly, only

one-fifth of Family Project pregnancies terminated at age 30 orolder. Even so, were risk torise as strongly with maternal age as Wilcox and Gladen believed, we might have expected a poorerfitin Table 4;the excellence of the fit suggests that their age effect is exaggerated.
The question of an age effect isthus not simply answered. Further evidence than elevated loss ratios isnecessary to show an excess risk inthe teens. Atthe other end of the reproductive age range, our data areconsistent with increased risk from themid-thirties onward,but without supporting evidence from other studies would be inconclusive. Thus, our results suggest that thestrength of this age effect may well have been overestimated in the past.
CONCLUSION

gravidity andageis uninformative because it does not attempt toaddress the underlying causes of the observed relationships.
Our findings demonstrate that recurrence risk cannot be the primary determinant of observed patterns of loss ratios according to gravidity and previous obstetric history. Rather, they indicate that observed patterns according to gravidity and previous outcome are not substantively interesting in themselves, but reflect theoperation of a fertilitystopping rule in conjunction with a highly skewed distribution of innate risk of loss. Ourfindingsindicate also that this innate risk is invariant with age at least until the mid-thirties and may not even rise particularly sharply beyond that point.

Analyses of pregnancy wastage routinely include tabulations by gravidity and maternal age.Variations in fetal loss ratios are frequently interpreted as reflecting changing risk at the individual level, which leads to either implicit or explicit support for the notion of recurrence risk. Moreover, an analysis that simply reports observed relations with
