ABSTRACT: This paper examines the degree of preoperative ambivalence expressed by 255 currently married tubal ligation patients compared to 167 wives of vasectomy patients regarding the decision to terminate childbearing and aspects of the decision-making process which account for differences between groups. Data indicate that tubal ligation women are significantly more certain and comfortable with their decision than are vasectomy wives. In order to explain this finding, analysis focused on sociodemographic factors; time factors related to the decision; variables related to communication with spouse and others; factors internal to the individual, including interest in another child and motivation for the decision; external constraints on the decision; and couple dynamics in the decision-making process. Results indicate that group differences in ambivalence are primarily due to the effects of strong male control over the termination decision, as perceived by the wife, and a disproportionate prevalence of this pattern among vasectomy couples. An interaction effect between male dominance and group membership was also found. Implications of study results for preoperative counseling, including likely sources of future regret, are considered.

term physical and psychosocial consequences of this surgery. Despite the volume of research in this area (e.g., see Henry et al., 1980), few strong conclusions can be drawn about the impact of this procedure. This is primarily due to methodological deficiencies of previous research, particularly failure to conduct prospective research and the absence of a carefully selected control group.
In order to understand the long-term consequences of tubal sterilization, a prospective controlled study of over 700 women has been undertaken. The study group consists of 317 women scheduled for surgical sterilization; the two control groups, respectively, consist of 167 women whose husbands have been scheduled for vasectomy (vasectomy wives group) and 244 women who have completed childbearing, but do not plan on sterilization (non-planning group). Data from vasectomy wives are used to control for physical and psychosocial effects of female sterilization and data from the non-planning group, for the sterilization decision itself. Subjects are Caucasian women between 18 and 49 years of age, chosen from the patient populations of approximately 50 obstetric-gynecology and urology offices and clinics in San Antonio, serving both lower-middle- and upper-class individuals. All women were intensively interviewed, either before surgery or, for women not planning sterilization, at a randomly assigned time. Follow-up is occurring at annual intervals from the firstinterview date.
This paper focuses on data collected from the initial interview. Only the two surgical subsamples, tubal ligation women and vasectomy wives, are included. Although these groups differ in several respects, they are much more similar to one another than either is to

the non-planning group, which appears to be at an earlier stage in the decisionmaking process regarding termination of childbearing. A future publication will address the entire sample. Eighty per cent of the tubal group are married (an additional 10 per cent have partners), compared to 100 per cent of the vasectomy women. By definition, vasectomy can be relied upon by women only when they are in a permanent relationship with a male. In order to maximize homogeneity between these groups, analyses presented in this paper are based on the married subsample (255 tubal ligation women and 167 vasectomy wives) alone. Differences between married and non-married respondents will be addressed at a later time.
One objective of this study is to identify characteristics of women who subsequently regret their decision. If this subgroup can be identified preoperatively and provided with appropriate counseling, incidence of dissatisfaction could be reduced. Reports of regret following surgical sterilization tend to be relatively infrequent, that is, usually less than 10 per cent and often less than 5 per cent (Paniagua et al., 1964; Cox and Crozier, 1973; Sim et al., 1973; DiMusto et al., 1974; Hampton and Tarnasky, 1974; Campanella and Wolff, 1975;Neil et al., 1975; Kopit and Barnes, 1976; Rubinstein et al., 1976; Watkins et al., 1976; Wise et al., 1976; Cheng et al., 1977; Stock, 1978; Henry et al., 1980). However, 5 per cent of 500,000 women annually undergoing the procedure is 25,000 individuals. Moreover, somewhere between less than 1per cent and 8 per cent of sterilized women are sufficiently dissatisfied to seek reanastomosis (Henry et al., 1980). The two major reasons for seeking reversal in the developed and developing world, respectively, are de-

sire to have children with a new husband and desire for more children, without further explanation (Henry et al., 1980). Because of these reasons and because the decision to terminate childbearing is the first step in choosing sterilization, preoperative ambivalence regarding childbearing termination is an important area of inquiry.
This paper examines the degree of preoperative ambivalence expressed by tubal ligation women, compared to vasectomy wives, regarding the termination of childbearing decision and aspects of the decision-making process which account for differences between groups. If there are group differences, it is important to know if they are related to which partner made the decision or is undergoing the procedure or to other factors. Moreover, analysis of these differences might provide clues as to whether or not these groups have differential needs which should be addressed during preoperative counseling. The association between ambivalence regarding the decision to terminate childbearing or to undergo elective sterilization and subsequent regret has not yet been documented in the literature; however, this relationship appears commonsensical and there is some evidence indicating a correlation between ambivalence concerning other types of reproductive decisions and subsequent regret.
Sacks and La Croix (1962), using a retrospective study design and no controls, found that 60per cent of their sample who regretted their decision to undergo a medically indicated sterilization expressed preoperative reluctance (either the woman, her husband, or both). Using a prospective design, but no controls, Campanella and Wolff (1975) attributed regret and psychosomatic

symptoms following elective and medically indicated sterilization to poor knowledge of the procedure, particularly its irreversibility. Some women questioned reversibility at the follow-up interviews, even when they were repeatedly reminded of the procedure's permanence. The authors suggest that this misunderstanding may show underlying ambivalence, with subsequent somatic displacement of feelings when permanency can no longer be denied. In a retrospective study of elective tubal sterilization and hysterectomy, Hampton and Tarnasky (1974) suggest that preoperative ambivalence about hysterectomy is related to subsequent adverse psychological reactions.
Lastly, a comprehensive study, combining a prospective and retrospective format, on the psychological antecedents and consequences of induced abortion specifically considered decision ambivalence. Data collected from a retrospective questionnaire and analyzed with multivariate techniques indicate that ambivalence about the abortion decision is a significant predictor of future regret (Miller, 1983).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Women in the tubal ligation sample were recruited through a letter given to them in their physicians' offices. Personnel in the various offices and clinics were asked to present each Anglo Caucasian woman scheduled for tubal sterilization with a letter which explained the study. Space was provided for names and telephone numbers of those patients who agreed to be contacted. Women who did not permit further contact were requested to provide, anonymously, basic sociodemographic information. The same recruitment procedure was fol-

lowed in urology offices: women accompanying their husbands for vasectomy counseling were given a recruitment letter. A separate letter was available for men who were not accompanied by their spouses. In these cases the men were asked to release their wives' names and phone numbers. Trained interviewers followed up by phone contact, at which time additional information about the study was provided and an interview scheduled. The overall refusal rate, including initial refusal on the letter and later refusal by phone contact, was less than 11 percent.
Women were interviewed in their homes or other locations of their own choosing. A reliability check was conducted; thirty-five women (or 5 per cent of the sample) were randomly chosen to be re-interviewed. Within several days to one month from their first interview, they were asked to re-answer questions ranging from basic sociodemographic queries to those concerning basic attitudes. A total of 350 repeat responses was obtained; only 13 (or 4 per cent) differed from the original.
The data on which this paper is based were collected during the sixteen-month period between December 1980 and March 1982. Analysis of variance and the Student-Newman-Keuls test are the primary statistical tools used. P values are based on the F statistic for means and the Z statistic for differences among proportions.
RESULTS
SAMPLE CHARACTERISTICS
Table 1 indicates several sociodemographic differences between tubal ligation and vasectomy groups. Women undergoing tubal sterilization are approximately one year older than vas-

ectomy wives (30.6 versus 29.5 years) and a significantly greater proportion of this group (42.3 per cent versus 6.6 per cent) are pregnant. The former also exhibit higher parity, defined to include current pregnancy, than do vasectomy wives (2.41 versus 2.11 children). The combined income of subject and spouse is significantly higher for the tubal ligation sample.
The remaining sociodemographic characteristics--years of education, employment status, income, Duncan's SES Scale rating, distribution of religious affiliations, and husband's age, income, years of education, and Duncan's SES Scale rating--show no significant differences between groups. Subsequent analyses have controlled for those characteristics that vary significantly between the tubal sterilization and vasectomy groups.
THE DECISION TOTERMINATE
CHILDBEARING
Table 2 provides data regarding ambivalence about the decision to terminate childbearing. Two measures of ambivalence are included in this study, i.e., degree of certainty regarding the termination decision (a continuum from completely certain through somewhat certain to not certain at all) and evidence of mixed feelings (a continuum from experiencing no conflict through temporary mixed feelings to continued feelings of strong conflict). There is obviously a great deal of overlap between these two measures. The primary difference-- based on the actual wording of the question--is that the first focuses on the woman's current (at the time of the interview) certainty that the termination decision is a correct one, whereas the second focuses on feelings of conflict after she first made the decision.

considered is perception of social pressure. These data are considered in two ways: (1) according to different types of social pressure (i.e., for, against, and both for and against) and (2) according towhetherornot any kind of socialpressure was perceived. As indicated in Table 4, there are no significant differences between groups when each type of social pressure is analyzed separately. However, 25 per cent of the vasectomy group compared to only 16 per cent of the tubal ligation group have experienced some form of social pressure (p<0.03). This difference, however, disappears after controlling for current pregnancy status. This suggests that pregnant women perceive less social pressure, perhaps because external con-

cerns are less salient to them. Moreover, further analysis of variance on differences in ambivalence (both measures) between tubal ligation and vasectomy groups, controlling for social pressure, fails to eliminate group differences. Consequently, social pressure alone cannot explain group differences in ambivalence.
The second variable considered in this table is influence of a recent experience. Approximately 20per cent of both groups were strongly influenced and approximately 10 per cent were somewhat influenced by a recent experience in making their termination decision. The great majority of these experiences related to unwanted pregnancy, abortion, health problems during pregnancy, or

choose the one reason which was most salient in their decision to terminate childbearing. Further analyses based on these data indicate that "husband does not want any more children" alone, when used as a control variable, eliminates group differences in one measure of ambivalence (mixed feelings). Thus, motivation data indicate that the most importance difference between groups is the salience, among vasectomy wives, of husband's feelings.
Table 7 provides data on couple dynamics involved in the decision-making

process, as perceived by the wife. These data indicate that there was conflict between spouses in approximately 15 per cent of the cases (no significant differences between groups). What is most interesting and important is that the role taken by the wife in the tubal ligation group is much stronger than that assumed by vasectomy wives, whereas male input is much greater in the vasectomy than in the tubal ligation group, Fifty-one per cent of wives initiated discussion in the tubal ligation group compared to 33 per cent of wives in the vas-

ectomy group. Only 9 per cent of husbands in the tubal ligation group, compared to 21 per cent in the vasectomy group, assumed the initiative, These differences are highly significant, Thirty-five per cent of women in the tubal ligation, versus only 11 per cent in the vasectomy group, wanted to end childbearing more than did their spouses. Nine per cent of husbands in the tubal ligation, versus 27 per cent in the vasectomy group, assumed this role, Again, these differences are highly significant. Lastly, 35per cent of tubal ligation versus only 13 per cent of vasectomy women, most greatly influenced the termination decision. On the other hand,21percentofhusbandsinthevasectomy, versus only 6 per cent in the

tubal ligation group, assumed the predominant role. As in the case of the two prior items, these differences are highly significant, even after controlling for inter-group sociodemographic variability. Further analysis of variance on differences in ambivalence between tubal ligation and vasectomy groups, controlling for either "which spouse wanted to end childbearing more" or "which had more influence," eliminates group differences in both measures of ambivalence (mixed feelings and degree of certainty); however, group differences in degree of certainty still remain close to levels of significance,
These data indicate that the differential roles played by spouses in making the decision to terminate childbearing

are related to ambivalence. Consequently, couple-dynamics variables will be examined more closely as indicators of perceived spousal "dominance" over the termination decision. Because the variable on initiative was shown not to add explanatory power beyond that contributed by the other two variables ("wanted to end childbearing more" and "had more influence"), it was not considered further.
The question to be further explored is: Do differences in couple decisionmaking dynamics with respect to which spouse dominated the termination decision account for differences in ambivalence between groups? In order to answer this question, the two measures of ambivalence presented in Table 2 were cross-tabulated with responses to the following variables: which spouse (1) wanted to end childbearing more and (2) had more influence. As indicated in Tables 8 and 9, current uncertainty and mixed feelings following the decision are significantly associated with husband responses for the sample as a whole, but particularly for the vasectomy group. This factor has a weaker effect within the tubal ligation sample. Wife and equal-role responses are generally similar (see mean values) and are significantly more positive than those in the husband category. For example, 71 per cent of the tubal ligation women whose husbands wanted to end childbearing more were completely certain of their decision, compared to 87 per cent of the women in the two other subgroups. In the vasectomy group, only 49 per cent of the women whose husbands wanted to end childbearing more were completely certain of their decision, compared to 86 per cent and 89 per cent,

respectively, for the wife and equal-role subgroups.
These data clearly illustrate that the husband-response group is distinct from both the equal- and wife-response group and should be explored in further detail. Consequently, further detailed analyses, including construction of an index measuring extent of control, focus on the effects of perceived male dominance. The index used in these analyses is based on the three best predictors of group differences in ambivalence: (1) husband wanted to end childbearing more, (2) husband had more influence, and (3) selection of "husband wanted no more children" as the most important reason for terminating childbearing.
For each subject, the following computation was made: The number of male responses and selection of the reason "husband wanted no more children" as the most important reason was multiplied by (-1) for a maximum of three responses; responses indicating either female or equal roles or selection of another primary reason were assigned the value of zero. A (-1) value indicated slight male control; a (--2) value, moderate control; a (-3) value, extensive male control; and 0, either equal or female control. Because of the relatively small number of cases with a (-3) value, (--2) and (--3) were combined into one category, called extensive male control. Distribution of the sample into these three categories (see Table 10) indicates that the decision to terminate childbearing was perceived to be dominated by the male in 12 per cent of tubal ligation versus 32 per cent of the vasectomy group (p =0.000). Perhaps even more importantly, 20 per cent of the vasectomy group compared to only 4 per cent

of the tubal ligation sample (p =0.000) is characterized by extensivemale control over the decision.
Table 11 demonstrates that maledominated decision-making is clearly related to present feelings of uncertainty. Women in both vasectomy-and tubal ligation groups who either made their own decision to terminate childbearing or did so jointly with their husbands are much more certain than those women whose husbands dominated the decision. Moreover, those women whose husbands exerted extensive control over the decision are significantly less certain than the women whose husbands exerted only slight control. Thus, 88 per cent of the tubal ligation sample who either dominated the termination decision or participated equally with their spouses were completely certain of that decision, compared to 76 per cent and 60 per cent of those women whose spouses exerted slight and -extensive control, respectively. Corresponding results for the vasectomy sample indicate that 87 per cent of the women whose spouses did not dominate the decision were completely certain, compared to 81 per cent and 39 per cent of

subjects whose spouses exerted slight and extensive control, respectively.
The effect of male dominance on certainty is stronger among vasectomy wives than tubal ligation subjects. Analysis of variance results indicate that tubal ligation women whose husbands dominated (slight combined with extensive control) the decision are significantly (p = 0.05) more certain that they want no more children than their counterparts in the vasectomy sample.
A final analysis of variance on differences in current feelings of certainty between tubal ligation and vasectomy groups, controlling for extent of perceived male dominance over the termination decision, results in the elimination of group differences (the initial p value of 0.001 [see Table 2] becomes 0.21).
Consideration of the second ambivalence variable, mixed feelings after having made the termination decision, demonstrates similar results. Data presented in Table 12 indicate that extensive male dominance, as opposed to slight and no male control combined in the vasectomy group, and to no male control in the tubal ligation group is most significantly
