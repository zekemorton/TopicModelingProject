ABSTRACT: Iran has the second highest age differential between husband and wife out of 55 countries studied (Dixon, 1971) and one almost twice as large as that for all countries combined. This article provides a set of basic reliable data on husband-wife age differentials in Shiraz, Iran, for marriages in 1956, 1966, 1973, and 1974, and for divorces in 1956, 1966, and 1973. The data provide support for the hypotheses: (1) the larger the difference between the ages of bride and groom, the higher the chance for family dissolution; and (2) the younger the brides, the greater the age differences between them and their grooms.

With regard to the physiological differences between men and women, it is generally thought that males reach their peak of sexual activity at an earlier age than females. From the point of view of sexual compatibility, a factor which affects marital stability, a man therefore should theoretically marry an older woman. However, in almost all societies the average age of grooms is higher than the average age of their brides. The difference ranges from an average of less than two years in some nations to close to ten years in others.
Dixon (1971) using Hajnal's (1953) singulate mean age at marriage calculated the husband-wife age difference in 55 Middle Eastern, Asian, English-speaking, and European countries. In IS (27.3 per cent) of these countries, the average difference was less than three years; in 22 (40.5 per cent) of them, the gap was three or more but less than four years; in 6 (10.9 per cent), it was four or more but less than five years; and, in 12 (21.8 per cent) countries, the gap between the average age of grooms and their brides was five or more years. Thus, in 78.2 per cent of the countries the difference was less than five years.

Dixon (1971) found grooms to be older than their brides in all societies examined, with an average difference ranging from 1.9 years in Yugoslavia to 9 years in Libya. Dixon (1971, p. 216) hypothesizes: "In general, the younger the brides, the greater is the age difference between them and their grooms." According to Dixon (1971), the Middle Eastern grooms are on the average 5.3 years older than their brides; Asian grooms, 4.7 years older; Eastern European grooms, 2.9 years older; and grooms in the English-speaking nations, 2.7 years older. The average was 3.8 years for all 55 countries examined.
A close examination of the available data shows that only in a very few countries in the world is the average gap more than 6 years. Libya with a difference of 9 years and Iran with close to 7 years occupy the highest positions in the world. According to calculations made by Dixon (1971), the age difference for Iran in 1956 was 6.5 years, the second highest among the 55 countries studied. Thus, the age gap in Iran is about twice as large as that for the world as a whole.
When discussing the causes of divorce,

social scientists attribute variation in divorce to such factors as age at marriage, race, social and population mobility, level of education, previous marital status of the man and the woman, the employeeworker ratio in the labor force, proportion urban population, the ratio of children to adult males, and a number of other variables (Mazur, 1969; Leslie, 1967; Rosenwaike, 1969; Bumpass and Sweet, 1972; Glick, 1957; Heiss, 1972; and, Weed, 1974). Of the aforementioned variables, age at marriage, or more specifically the proportion of teenage marriages, is shown to be a good predictor of divorce. Very little, however, is known about the effects of husband-wife age differentials on this social problem.
Although Iran is one of the very few countries in the world with a large gap between the age of the grooms and their brides, there is very little reliable information on this phenomenon and its social consequences. Thus, one of the objectives of this study is to provide a set of basic reliable data relative to husband-wife age differentials in Iran. A second objective is to provide empirical evidence in support of the following hypotheses: (a) the larger the difference between the ages of the grooms and their brides, the higher the chances for family dissolution; and, (b)the younger the brides, the greater is the age difference between them and their grooms.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study utilizes three sets of data. The primary data consist of information for the Iranian years 1335, 1345, and 1352 (approximately 1956, 1966, and 1973) obtained from marriage contracts and divorce certificates issued in the city of Shiraz, the sixth largest city in Iran.
The Iranian year begins on March 21 or 22, so that the year 1335 would correspond

to the period between March 21, 1956 and March 20, 1957. The Iranian solar year (SY) may be converted to the year of the Christian era (YCE) by the formula: SY + 621 = YCE.
Located in the southern part of Iran, Shiraz increased in population from 170,659 in 1956 to 269,865 in 1966, an annual growth rate of 4.58 per cent. At this growth rate, the population of Shiraz was estimated at 410,000 in 1975. The demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of the population of Shiraz are very similar to those of other large Iranian cities, so that the findings relative to Shiraz may well hold true for other cities in Iran.
The documents utilized are available at special bureaus called Mahzars where the registration of marriages and divorces take place. The records kept at the Mahzars as yet constitute the best source of information relative to nuptiality in Iran. The years 1956 and 1966 were chosen because during these years the first and second nationwide censuses of Iran were taken, and thus other demographic characteristics of the population are available for comparative purposes. The year 1973 was chosen because it constituted the last completed year of registered marriages and divorces.
The second set of data consists of random interviews of four hundred newly married couples in Shiraz in 1974. The third set of data was obtained from a sample of 446 couples who applied to the Shiraz Health Department for premarital blood tests in 1974. Almost all couples applying for premarital blood tests marry within seven days after the test as the certificates are valid for seven days only.
It should be pointed out that this study compares marriages of certain years with divorces of the same years. Since these are two independent series of events, it would have been more appropriate to compare,

say, the divorces of 1956 with marriages of the years when the 1956 divorce cohort were married. Needless to say, such data do not exist. But since it is believed that there has been very little change in the husband-wife age differentials during the time difference between the two independent series, no great errors are expected to result from comparing the two independent series.
It should also be pointed out that prior to 1967 only men had the right to seek divorce. In 1967, the Family Protection Law abolished the males' right to repudiate their wives unilaterally. Women also gained equal rights to initiate divorce preceedings on certain specified grounds, such as impotence, adultery, insanity, failure of husband to maintain her, illtreatment, husband's imprisonment for five years or more, addiction of husband, when a man marries a second wife, and when he behaves in a manner damaging to the honor and prestige of the family.
It is beyond the scope of this paper to go into details concerning the divorce laws, reasons for divorce, chances for remarriage, and the inheritance and the property holding laws in Iran. It may, however, be of interest that the remarriage rate in Iran is quite low and that both

married and divorced women can own and operate their own properties.
RESULTS
The basic results of this study are displayed in Table 1, showing the distribution of husband-wife age differentials for all those marrying in Shiraz in the years 1956, 1966, 1973, and 1974; and for those divorcing in 1956, 1966, and 1973. In most countries in the world, the average groom is a little over three years older than his bride. Based on this universal experience, it may be argued that gaps of five or more years are undesirable. In view of this arbitrarily defined acceptable age difference, an examination of Table 1shows that only a small proportion of Shirazi marriages may be considered acceptable. In only 21.6 per cent of marriages in 1956, 18.0 per cent of marriages in 1966, and in 29.6 per cent of marriages in 1973 were the husbands four or fewer years older than their brides. For the majority of the marriages, the difference was more than five years.

and wife in Shiraz for the four time periods. Since the variations in the mean age at marriage during the years 19S6, 1966, and 1974 are not significantly different, it is difficult to make a definitive statement about the trend in the mean age at marriage in Shiraz between 1956 and 1974. However, the slight decline in the mean age at marriage between 1956 and 1966 is not unique to Iran. Several other nations have also experienced a similar decline (Momeni, 1975c, pp. 25-27) during the same period. Easterlin (1967, 1968), has linked the decline in the age at marriage to the economic cycle. Economic prosperity may lead to a temporary increase in the number of marriages and a decline in the average age at first marriage.
The rate of economic growth in Iran in the past decade or so has been one of the highest in the world. The observed decline

in the average age at marriage in Shiraz could be partly explained as a response to rapid economic development and increased prosperity in Iran. This declining trend is not expected to continue for long, however. As the country passes through the transitional stage from developing to a developed phase, a variety of socioeconomic and demographic changes, such as increased income and level of education, increased urbanization, and females' nonagricultural labor force participation are expected to influence the age at marriage to change its course and assume an upward trend.
Indeed, this upward trend can already be detected in Shiraz, because the decline in the average age from 21.1 in 1956 to 20.0 in 1966 is followed by an increase to 20.3 in 1973. The increased peakedness in the age at marriage distribution in 1973 as

Protection Law played the major role in changing the age at marriage schedule. Prior to 1967 (i.e., in 1956 and 1966), a law enacted in 1935 concerning a minimum age at marriage (age 16 for girls) was hardly enforced. But as a result of the new Family Protection Law, the law was strongly enforced, and a number of under-age marriages were prevented. However, those who could not marry before reaching the legal age usually married immediately after they reached the legal
age. From an examination of Tables 2 and 3,

STRUCTURE OF HUSBAND-WIFE AGE DIFFERENTIALS
The mean, modal, and median husband-wife age differentials are probably the most frequently used summary statistics for the frequency distribution of age differences. But to have a complete picture about the characteristics of a distribution, further analysis is necessary. A number of measures may be used to describe a distribution. Standard deviation, measures of skewness, peakedness (kur-

husband-wife age differentials for Shiraz indicate significant departure from normality, due to the large values of s, the skewness, and the peakedness (leptokurtosis) of the distributions. Relative to marriages based on the above measures, the 1973 distribution is more skewed and peaked than either the 1956 or the 1966 distributions, indicating a major shift in the husband-wife age differentials between 1956 and 1973. Relative to skewness, as measured by a3, all three distributions are positively skewed. But there is little difference between the skewness as well as the spread (coefficient of variation) of the 1956 distribution compared with the 1973 distribution.
As a whole, the 1973 distribution is markedly different from the 1956 and the 1966 distributions. The 1973 distribution has the lowest value for s, but the highest values fora3 and a4. The 1966 distribution has the lowest value for peakedness indicating that a smaller proportion of the age differences conform to the typical (mean) age gap between the marrying persons.
The increased peakedness of the husband-wife age differentials distributions from 1956 to 1973 indicates that the mean differential has fallen, but at the same time the concentration of age differentials around this mean differential has increased. In spite of the fact that there has been a persistence of some marriages with large age differences (that is, distant from the average), the trend toward a smaller gap is associated with an increase in conformity in the typical husband-wife age differential.
This tendency of more and more marriages" to conform to the typical husband-wife age difference is also evident from the value of the standard deviation of the distributions as shown in Table 4. It may be noted that in 1973 when the value of peakedness was the highest,.the value of i was the lowest, indicating a

lesser degree of variability or deviation from the typical gap. In other words, an increase in peakedness means concentration of observations (husband-wife age gap in this case) in the center of the distribution or one standard deviation away from the mean gap.
TEST OF HYPOTHESES
In the introductory section of this paper it was stated that the second objective of this study was to test two hypotheses: (a) the larger the gap between the age of the grooms and their brides, the higher the chances for family dissolution; (b) the younger the brides, the greater is the age difference between them and their grooms. This section deals with testing these hypotheses.
Large age gap/marital instability.--It has been demonstrated that the mean difference between the ages of marrying individuals included in this study was smaller than the mean difference between the ages of those divorcing. This fact is also evident from Table 1, which shows that the proportion of divorcing couples with husband-wife age differentials of 15 years or more is much higher than the corresponding proportions for those marrying, especially those marrying in 1973 and 1974. For example, while 20.6 to 22^.6 per cent of the couples divorcing had an age difference of 15 years or more, only 11.0 per cent of couples marrying in 1973, 8.2 per cent of couples interviewed in 1974, and 8.3 per cent of couples applying for premarital blood tests had an age difference of 15 years or more. That is, the proportion of couples divorcing in 1973 with 15 or more years age difference was about twice as great as the proportion of persons with an age difference of 15 or more years marrying in 1973 and 2.5 times greater than the proportion of those with an age gap of 15+ years marrying in 1974.

This finding would seem to offer evidence in support of our hypothesis.
Lower average age of brides liarger age gaps.--The examination of the difference between the median age of grooms and brides in a random sample of ten countries with a median age of brides of 20 or above revealed an average age difference of 2.9 years, while in a sample of countries with the median age of brides below 20, the gap was 6.6 years. That is, lower median age of brides was found to be associated with larger husband-wife age differentials. In Libya, Iran, Morocco, Egypt, Tunesia, Algeria, Iraq, India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Singapore, and Hong Kong where the mean husband-wife age differential is five or more years, the average age of brides was found to be 19.2 years. In thirty countries, not listed here, with the average husband-wife age differential between 3 and 4.9 years, the average age of brides was found to be 21.9 years, while in fifteen countries with an average age difference of Jess than three years, the average age of brides was found to be 23.0 years. These findings support the hypothesis that the lower the average age of brides, the larger the gap between the age of husband and wife.
Treating the average age of brides as the independent variable and the husbandwife age gap for sixty countries as the dependent variable, the simple correlation coefficient, r, was found to be - 0.74. The large negative value of r provides strong empirical support in favor of our hypothesis. The data for Shiraz provide additional evidence regarding the inverse relation between the average age of brides and the husbnad-wife age differentials. In 1966 when the average age of brides was the lowest, the husband-wife age differential was the highest.
There are several reasons for the wide gap between the ages of husband and wife in Iran. As this hypothesis explains, early

female age at marriage contributes to this wide gap. In Iran, most marriages are arranged; virginity is one of the transcendental values (Momeni, 1972); younger girls are preferred; and a man iseconomically, socially, and morally responsible for his wife. Most males have to finish their military service and not only attain economic independence (i.e., have jobs and regular income) but also have sufficient savings and/or property to be able to pay a dower before they can marry. These and other social structural and institutional mechanisms promote child and early marriage of females and relatively late age at marriage (26 years) for males. The combination of early female and late male age at marriage results in wide husband-wife age differentials.
SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION
Using three sets of data relative to four different periods in time, the distributions of the husband-wife age differentials for those marrying and divorcing in Shiraz are examined. The standard deviation, coefficient of variation, mean, and measures of skewness and peakedness of the distributions are calculated. Two hypotheses relative to the relationship between husband-wife age gap/marital instability and the average age of brides/husbandwife age gaps are tested.
It is concluded that: (1) The husbandwife age differential in Iran is one of the highest in the world. (2) This large gap between the age of husband and wife contributes to marital instability in Shiraz. (3) The marriage of girls at an early age contributes to the large difference between the age of husband and wife. (4) The gap has narrowed between 1966 and 1974, and this trend is expected to continue in the future.
