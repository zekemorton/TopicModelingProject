1940, 1950, and 1960 used the term "PartHawaiians" for all persons reporting any Hawaiian admixture; the 1970 census does not differentiate between Hawaiians and Part-Hawaiians, all being reported as "Hawaiians." Although some Japanese immigrants arrived hi 1868, "Japanese" was not made a separate category until 1884, just before a major wave of Japanese immigration got underway in 1885. Negroes were snot listed separately until 1900, following annexation to the United States in 1898. Filipino, Korean, Puerto Rican, and Spanish became regularly listed categories in 1910, Ibut Spanish and Portuguese were eliminated after the 1930 census.
By 1853, the Hawaiians (persons nominally of unmixed Hawaiian descent) had declined to 70,000 from the 300,000 that, by best estimates, populated the Hawaiian Sslands at the time of Captain Cook's arrival in 1778. Those claiming to be full Hawaiians have continued to decline, down to a figure of only slightly above 10,000, according to the 1960 census. While mortality rates, particularly infant mortality rates, have been considerably higher among Hawaiians than among other groups in Hawaii, the decline during the last century is attributable more to high rates of outmarriage among the Hawaiians and the consequent listing of their children among the rapidly growing Part-Hawaiian population. In fact, the actual number of unmixed Hawaiians has decreased more than is shown by the census, because of the inclusion of many part-Hawaiian s in the Hawaiian group.
Even in 1853, the distinction between Hawaiians and Part-Hawaiians was imprecise. The 983 "half-natives" listed must be regarded as persons who had the social position of "half-native" rather than as the entire number of part-Hawaiians. During the 75 years after foreign contact began in 1778, many children of Hawaiian mothers and foreign fathers, mainly Caucasians, had

been reared as Hawaiians and absorbed into the indigenous group, a process facilitated by the widespread practices among Hawaiians of adoption and rearing of children by women older than the natural mothers. As a result of continued absorption of partHawaiians into the Hawaiian group since 1853, those now claiming to be "full-Hawaiians" include a large number of persons with admixture of other racial ancestries. On the basis of blood-type evidence, Morton, Chung, and Mi concluded that the "Hawaiians" in their study showed 8.5% Caucasian admixture and 13.7% Chinese admixture, with at least 44% having some combination of Chinese-Caucasian admixture. Some, but fewer, Part-Hawaiians have been absorbed into other racial groups, primarily Caucasian and Chinese. Even with these losses, by 1950 the Part-Hawaiians (those of recognized mixed ancestry) had become larger in numbers than the entire population of Hawaii in 1853 (73,845 compared with 73,137) and they increased to 91,597 by 1960, an increase of over 24% during the period 1950-60. Moreover, these figures do not reveal the extensive migration of Part-Hawaiians from Hawaii to the mainland United States during the 1950's (Taeuber, 1962).
MISCEGENATION SEQUENCE
Racial intermixture in Hawaii, which began with the intermingling between Hawaiians and successive immigrant groups and which has continued with intermixture among the immigrant groups themselves, has occurred under the social rubric that has been called Hawaii's "unorthodox race doctrine" (Adams, 1934). Adams reconstructed the conditions which led to the public sanctioning of marriages between Hawaiians and foreigners, by both the ruling Hawaiian elite and the Protestant missionaries who arrived in the 1820's. As Adams (1934), Lind (1967), and others have shown, this doctrine was later challenged by

the development of a hierarchal social structure on the plantations and military posts in the Islands, but it nevertheless prevailed. Even though prejudices among some individuals of all ethnic groups have affected some intimate and personal social relations, including mate selection, the doctrine has led to a remarkably open society for intergroup and interpersonal relations.
The development of Hawaii's multiracial population has been largely a consequence of successive waves of immigration. Without going into historical details, we can consider typical phases of miscegenation that occurred as most of the ethnic groups came into Hawaii: (1) a phase of relatively extensive admixture between foreign men and local women, largely through casual relations and "marriages of convenience" (Hormann, 1948); (2) a phase of relative decline of intermixture as each immigrant group attempted to establish an ethnic society discouraging out-marriage and encouraging in-group marriage through arranged marriages; (3) the current phase of increase in out-marriages by Americanized members of the Hawaii-born descendants of immigrants, typified by "marriages of romance." I believe that the phases also characterize other island areas of Oceania, although not many South Pacific island communities have advanced as far into the third phase as has Hawaii.
In the first phase, nearly all incoming foreigners were adult males. During most of the period, the local women were mainly Hawaiian and, later, Part-Hawaiian. In the earliest part of this phase, miscegenation was largely through casual relations, with the offspring being absorbed into the indigenous population. Some early European men who were placed in high positions in Hawaiian society because of their services to Hawaiian chiefs were given Hawaiian wives of high status, and their offspring were integrated into the Hawaiian elite. As the numbers of resident European men--trad-

ers, artisans, and others--increased, more of them established permanent relations with Hawaiian women and shared in the rearing of their children. As a rule, the children of these families were not regarded as a distinct racial or social group, although they were frequently referred to as kapahaoles (persons of mixed Hawaiian and European ancestry). Since the Europeans were concentrated in the port towns, the hapa-haoles were also, and as more European men came into the towns, more of them married hapa-haolewomen, so there was an increasing number of Part-Hawaiians who approached the European physical type. At the same time, since some Part-Hawaiian women married Hawaiian or Part-Hawaiian men, and most Part-Hawaiian men married Hawaiians or Part-Hawaiians, the PartHawaiians who approached the Hawaiian physical type increased more rapidly than those approachbg the European type. Many of these were absorbed into the indigenous population and became identified simply as Hawaiians.
In the second phase, when substantial numbers of European women were brought to Hawaii durbg the latter half of the nineteenth century, a settled European community of ranked families became established. The development of a haole ("white") managerial class on the plantations, and a haole business community in the towns, with wives from Europe and America, led to efforts to discourage continued intermixture between members of this community and the Hawaiians and Part-Hawaiians, although intermarriage with members of the Hawaiian and Part-Hawaiian elite was tolerated.
The importation of Chinese males as plantation laborers, beginning in 1852 and continuing intermittently until the end of the century, produced a similar sequence. Coming to Hawaii without women, a considerable number of these Chinese men lived with Hawaiian or Part-Hawaiian

women, and a Chinese-Hawaiian population emerged. When Chinese wives were finally brought in, a Chinese community developed, particularly in the larger towns. A few Chinese-Hawaiians were absorbed into it, mainly by marriages of Chinese-Hawaiian women to Chinese men, but the practice of arranged marriages in the Chinese community encouraged in-group marriage among the early generations of Hawaii-born Chinese. The majority of the Chinese-Hawaiians had closer ties to their Hawaiian mothers' families and to the Hawaiian community than to their Chinese fathers' ethnic group.
Two other large groups later imported as plantation laborers--Japanese, beginning in the 1880's, and Filipinos, mainly after World War I--went through a similar sequence, but with important modifications that cannot be detailed here. One exception was the Portuguese who, from their first importations for plantation labor in the late 1870's, came in with wives and children so that a relatively small proportion of the first generation immigrant men out-married.
With increasing Americanization of all the peoples of Hawaii, arranged marriages in Hawaii's Asian groups diminished and have been largely replaced by "marriages of romance." Except for the Filipinos, these groups now have third, fourth, and even some fifth Hawaii-born generations. During the second phase of the miscegenation sequence, the mating barriers erected by immigrant groups establishing ethnic communities were based on coinciding cultural and "racial" differences. However, the extent to which racial categories continue to represent distinctive cultural groups has been declining. Acculturation to American life styles has reduced cultural differences between Hawaii-born descendants of different immigrant groups as well as between those of Hawaiian and non-Hawaiian ancestry.

Older and younger generations of the same ethnic group have become culturally more different from each other than are younger members of different ethnic groups. With interracial dating publicly accepted (although privately resisted by many parents), interracial marriages have increased. Differences in intermarriage rates, however, indicate that ethnic mating boundaries have not completely disappeared, even when other demographic facts are accounted for. Such facts include high sex ratios for males of marriageable age within the Filipino and Caucasian populations, with corresponding higher out-marriage rates among males than females. Groups with more balanced sex ratios show an inverse tendency toward higher out-marriage rates among the females than the males. When ethnic differences decline as barriers to marriage the greater availability of unmarried males in other groups is reflected in more out-marriages of females from the groups with a more balanced sex ratio (Cheng and Yamamura, 1957).
The smaller ethnic groups, such as Koreans and Puerto Ricans--each only about one per cent of Hawaii's population of about 750,000--tend to show higher outmarriage rates for females than do larger groups such as the Japanese where there are larger numbers of in-group males of marriageable age from whom to select mates. But even when the effects of these demographic variables are allowed for, one still finds differences in predilection toward outmarriage. Time of arrival of the immigrant generation becomes relevant here; groups which have been in the Islands longer (Chinese, Portuguese) tend to have higher out-marriage rates than those with a shorter history in the Islands (Japanese, Filipinos). It may be inferred that those of marriageable age in the latter groups are more responsive to traditional ethnic influences on mate selection.

EXTENT OF OUT-MARRIAGE
Reports on marriage by race of bride and groom began in 1912; by that year mate selection through dating rather than parental arrangement was already underway; the earlier immigrant groups were in the second or third phases of the miscegenation sequence, although the Filipino group, whose immigration was just beginning, was in the first phase. Trends of in-marriage and out-marriage since 1912 are suggested by Table 1, which shows that out-marriages have increased from 11.5% of all marriages for 1912-16 to 36.1% for 1960-69. Table 2 gives more detailed data about the racial identity of brides and grooms in the 23,713 out-marriages in 1960-69. Marriages during this decade represented all except three of the hundred possible combinations of brides and grooms among the ten identified categories. The two combinations with the largest numbers (3,006 and 2,301) were marriages of Caucasians and Part-Hawaiians; the next two largest numbers were of marriages of Caucasian grooms with Japanese and Filipino brides (1,660 and 1,422 respectively). The other two combinations in which over 1,000 out-marriages were registered were those of Filipino men with PartHawaiian women and of Part-Hawaiian men with Japanese women.
Interpretation of the data in Tables 1 and 2 must take into account some of the ambiguities in the racial categories used and the question of what constitutes an "interracial marriage." Those interested in the genetic implications of these marriages will recognize that the data conceal much relevant information.
In the first place, if one accepts the categories used in these tables as referring to "races" or "racial groups," as has been common in Hawaii for decades, then an interracial marriage is a marriage between persons of two different categories, for example, bride Hawaiian, groom Chinese. Following the same principle, a marriage of

a Hawaiian to a Part-Hawaiian is counted as interracial. The inconsistency of this distinction is apparent when one realizes that a high proportion, if not most, of those classified as Hawaiians have, in fact, some Caucasian or Asian ancestry, or both. Beyond this, one may consider the anthropologists' conclusions that the Polynesian peoples, including the Hawaiians, are themselves a blend of elements loosely identified as proto-Caucasoid and proto-Malayoid. Further uncertainty about the genetic constitution of the "pre-contact" Hawaiian population is added by the possibility of Melanesian Negroid elements in some of the Polynesian peoples, suggested by recent evidence of interrelationships between Polynesian and Melanesian cultures. Leaving aside these speculations, it is fairly certain that the boundary between those now calling themselves Hawaiians and those identified as Part-Hawaiians is becoming increasingly blurred. At the same time, there is a great range in physical appearance among the Part-Hawaiians, from very "Hawaiian-looking" to blue-eyed blonds. In view of this, a marriage between two PartHawaiians may quite possibly represent a "more interracial" marriage than one between a Hawaiian and a Part-Hawaiian. Similarly, a marriage between a Caucasian groom and the blue-eyed Part-Hawaiian may be "less interracial" than one between a Hawaiian and a Part-Hawaiian, or between two Caucasians where one is of North European ancestry and the other of Italian or Portuguese descent.
This last example calls attention to a change in the practice of reporting race in Hawaii which has affected the definition of "interracial marriage" in the Islands. In line with continental United States practice, all Caucasians are now lumped together in the Hawaiian statistics (the term "Caucasian" being used in Hawaii instead of the term "white" as on the mainland). When annual data on interracial marriages began

to be issued in 1912, the Portuguese and Spanish groups, which had originally been imported as plantation laborers, were reported as categories separate from "Other Caucasians," the term used in census reports mainly for persons of North European origin known locally as hades. Following this practice, a marriage between a Spanish groom and a Portuguese bride was counted as interracial, as would have been a marriage between an "Other Caucasian" groom and a Spanish or Portuguese bride; however, the children of a Spanish-Portuguese marriage, as well as of a marriage of an "Other Caucasian" to Spanish or Portuguese, were classified as "Other Caucasians." With decrease in numbers of the Spanish and Portuguese groups, as a consequence of their migration in large numbers to the mainland and their high rates of out-marriage (especially to "Other Caucasians") and with their objection to being categorized separately from "Other Caucasians," the categories "Portuguese," "Spanish" and "Other Caucasians" were dropped as census classifications for Hawaii in 1940, and all were reported as "Caucasians." While the Spanish have largely disappeared as a social category in Hawaii, Portuguese are still widely identified as a distinct ethnic group.
Even though distinctions between subgroups of Caucasians have been dropped from official statistics in Hawaii, several government agencies of the state have continued to differentiate between different categories of Asians. As Tables 2 and 4 show, Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, and Filipinos are still differentiated in marriage and birth statistics. It could probably be maintained that marriage between a Japanese and a Korean is genetically "less interracial" than one between a Caucasian of North European descent and an island-born Portuguese. In other words, maintaining boundaries between subtypes of Asians while ignoring distinctions between subtypes of Caucasians leads to a somewhat inconsistent usage of the term "interracial marriage."

The artificial character of official categories as indicating cultural and genetic mating boundaries is further revealed when one notes that the subcategories of Asians, particularly such as the Chinese and Filipinos, refer to quite heterogeneous populations. The Chinese in Hawaii came largely from the Canton area of Kwangtung Province, an area that had extensive contacts with Southeast Asia, and even more distant regions, for centuries before Chinese came to Hawaii. Undoubtedly many mixed offspring of Chinese were brought back and absorbed into the Cantonese population, just as some Chinese-Hawaiian children were taken back to the Canton area from Hawaii. Even the Chinese population in Hawaii has some Hawaiian admixture, because, as we know, some persons with some Hawaiian ancestry live and are known hi Hawaii as "Chinese." Filipino immigrants came to Hawaii after there had been centuries of admixture of the indigenous Filipino peoples with Chinese and Spanish in the Philippines.
Two smaller groups in Hawaii which are heterogeneous, Puerto Rican and Negroes--each constituting about one per cent of the population--are also treated as "races" in computing interracial marriages, even though it is obvious that a marriage between a Puerto Rican and a Negro, or between a Negro and a Caucasian, could very well be "less interracial" than one between two Puerto Ricans or two Negroes.
While maintaining distinctions between large categories of Asians, Hawaiian statistical reporting ignores some socially and culturally defined subgroups within these categories. For a long time after their migration to Hawaii, Chinese of the "Punti" group and those of the "Hakka" group considered themselves physically and culturally distinct and did not arrange or sanction marriages between members of the two groups. Among the Filipinos who migrated to Hawaii there were marked linguistic and other cultural differences, such as those between the Ilocanos, Tagalogs,

286

and Visayans. In Hawaii, all Filipinos are treated as a single group, even though ethnic differences among them were traditional mating boundaries in the Philippines and continued to be, to some extent, in Hawaii. Two groups of immigrants classified together as "Japanese" in Hawaiian statistics were those from Okinawa and those from the main islands of Japan (referred to in Hawaii as "Naichi"). Japanese "Naichi" rejected the idea of arranging marriages between their children and those of Okinawans and continued for a long time to disapprove "Naichi"-Okinawan dating and intermarriage (Yamamoto, 1957).
Even if one were to ignore the imprecision of "racial" classifications, interpreting the data is complicated by the arbitrary rules followed in assigning individuals to categories, a complication of which demographers are well aware. Statistical reporting in Hawaii follows general United States practice except for persons of Hawaiian ancestry. Any child who has one Hawaiian or Part-Hawaiian parent is classified as Part-Hawaiian. This means that, in Hawaii, a child of a Hawaiian or Part-Hawaiian parent and a Negro would be classified as Part-Hawaiian. As on the mainland, a child of a Caucasian parent and a non-Caucasian (other than Hawaiian or Part-Hawaiian) parent is classified by the race of the nonCaucasian parent, and if both parents are non-Caucasian (but neither is Hawaiian, Part-Hawaiian, or Negro) the child is classified by the race of the father. The cumulative effect of the rule regarding Hawaiian ancestry has been to rapidly increase the Part-Hawaiian group. However, the cumulative effects of increasing out-marriages between Chinese, Japanese, Filipinos, and Koreans cannot be observed because the children of these intermarriages are classified back into the paternal groups.
One estimate is that by 1968 there were 65,500 persons of mixed ancestry other than Part-Hawaiians, the latter being approxi-

mately twice that number (State of Hawaii Department of Planning and Economic Development, 1970). Nearly all of these "other mixtures" would be reported as Japanese, Chinese, Filipinos, or Koreans, and in 1968 they would have constituted about one-fifth of the total population for these four categories. Nearly all would be under age 30, the majority not yet of marriageable age. However, an undeterminable number of marriages are already taking place in which, for example, the groom is Chinese and the bride Chinese-Japanese, or the groom Japanese and the bride JapaneseKorean. These marriages do not appear as "interracial" marriages whereas a marriage between a Hawaiian and a Part-Hawaiian is counted as "interracial." This type of distortion will increase as more of the "other mixtures" reach marriageable age; moreover, even if birth rates generally decline in the Islands, the proportion of these "other mixtures" in the reported population of the four groups will increase in succeeding generations. It is evident that the very increase in interracial marriage over generations will increase our difficulty in using statistical data as clues to the genetic make-up of the population or the rate at which "interracial marriage" is going
on. EXTENT OF ADMIXTURE
A related difficulty arises in attempting to analyze the character and extent of amalgamation resulting from interracial marriage and miscegenation. Table 3 indicates the extent of admixture reported for two periods: July 1931 through December 1950, and the 1960's. Table 4 provides more detailed information on live births by race of known parents for the 1960's. Taking the figures at face value, one sees that the proportion of children of mixed racial ancestry in Hawaii's population continued to rise from the already high 31.2% of the earlier period to 36.8% for the last decade. The latter figure is almost the same as the per-

centage (36.1%) of interracial marriages reported ia Table 2 for the same period. However, marriages between Part-Hawaiians were not counted as interracial marriages, whereas children of such marriages are naturally included among those of mixed ancestry. If the marriages between Part-Hawaiians were added to the outmarriages in Table 2, the percentage would rise 43.7%. The births of children of mixed ancestry, therefore, appear to be somewhat below the potentialities suggested by the intermarriage rates.
However, drawing inferences about fertility of interracial marriages involves coping with several unknowns. In the first place, of course, not all the brides in Table 2 are the same persons as the mothers in Table 4. Many of the mothers of racial intercrosses born during the years 1960-69 were married before 1960, and many brides who outmarried during 1960-69 may have had ho children during that period or may have had them after moving away from Hawaii. The relatively large number of military personnel and dependents in Hawaii (nearly

one-seventh of the state's estimated population on January 1, 1969) also affects the analysis, since a substantial proportion of the Caucasian grooms in interracial marriages have been of this group during most of the last four decades. With reassignment of military personnel, a considerable number of Hawaii-born, non-Caucasian wives leave the Islands during the years they are most likely to have children. Still a further important variable is suggested by the fact that 50% of the Caucasian brides and 47% of the Caucasian grooms were married in the last three years of the decade, after Hawaii became a major meeting place for men on "R & R" from Vietnam with their mainland girl friends.
The out-marriage rate for Caucasian grooms dropped from 34.5% for 1960-66 to only 21.1% for these three "R &R years." Children born to most of the couples in the "R & R marriages" will not be born in Hawaii. On the other hand, a large number of Caucasian wives of Caucasian service-men have children while their husbands are stationed in Hawaii, and their children are

counted in Hawaii's birth statistics. Most of these circumstances work in the direction of reducing the percentage of "mixed" children in the total births recorded in Hawaii.
Another important unknown relates to the fact, already noted, that by 1967 an estimated 65,500 racially mixed individuals, mostly of Asian intercrosses, were classified simply as Chinese, Japanese, Filipinos, or Koreans. The children of any of these individuals who marry an "unmixed" Asian of the same category will actually be "mixed," although they would not be so recorded in such annual reports as those on which Table 4 is based. The assumption is that this distortion is not yet substantial but it will become increasingly great.
Under-enumeration of children of mixed racial ancestry also comes from the practice of classifying as "unmixed" those children whose parents are both identified as Hawaiian, even though a large percentage of "Hawaiians" have some Caucasian or Asian admixture. The same is true of many children whose parents are both Puerto Rican or both Negro.
Finally, Table 4 does not include illegitimate births except where the race of both parents is known. During the period 196069, 10,732 live births were reported for whom the race of the father was unknown; in all but 235 cases the race of the mother was reported. Thirty-nine per cent of the mothers were Part-Hawaiians and another 3 % were Hawaiians; the other large groups were Caucasian (24%), Filipino (12%), and Japanese (9%). It can reasonably be assumed that many more than half of these infants were of mixed ancestry.
In view of these unknowns, it is not possible to make any reliable comparisons in quantitative terms of the fertility of interracial and in-group marriages. About the best that can be said is that the fertility of interracial marriages appears to be at least equal to and probably higher than that of in-group marriages. Neither do available

data permit conclusions about the demographic and social factors, usually associated with fertility rates, as they pertain to interracial marriages. The nearest approach to such conclusions comes from the findings of Schmitt's (1968) study of demographic factors in interracial marriages occurring in Hawaii in 1961 and 1962. He found that interracial marriage rates were higher (1) in rural Hawaii; (2) for brides under 20; (3) for couples in operative, service, and laborer categories; and (4) for couples with lower than median incomes. Ordinarily these variables have been associated with higher rather than lower fertility rates.
MATING BOUNDARIES AND "RACIAL" ADMIXTURE
Another approach to analyzing interracial marriage is suggested by Table 5, which shows selected combinations of marriages. If one were to assume that traditional mating boundaries would be weakest between "racially similar" groups, with "race" being thought of along traditional lines, one might expect that out-marriages of members of the four most "racially similar" groups in Hawaii--Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, and Filipinos--would be predominantly with members of another of these subgroups of Asians. However, as Table 5 shows, only about a fifth of the out-marriages by Asians were with members of the other Asian groups. More than twice as many married Caucasians, and almost twice as many married Hawaiians or PartHawaiians. Of the total out-marriages included in the table, only 11% were Asian intermarriages, while 43% were between Asians and non-Asians. Assuming that marriages between Part-Hawaiians are actually, even though not officially, interracial, outmarriages among the Hawaiians and PartHawaiians were about one-third with Asians, one-third with Caucasians, and one-third with other Hawaiians and Part-Hawaiians. Of the Caucasians out-marrying, a few more

are born there. Nevertheless, whatever the factors associated with the differences in the number of intercrosses of these five types of combinations, three-fourths of the intercrosses born during the past decade have some Hawaiian ancestry. Even though higher infant mortality rates among Hawaiians and Part-Hawaiians will reduce the proportion of their children who survive, the "Hawaiian identity" will still remain for the bulk of intercrosses who live into

adult years. Moreover, since there is generally pride in identifying any amount of Hawaiian ancestry, no matter how small, the probable continued increase in interracial marriage will spread the Hawaiian element through the Island population. This, together with acculturation to American life patterns among all the ethnic groups in Hawaii's population, can be expected to weaken further the traditional culturally and racially defined mating boundaries.
