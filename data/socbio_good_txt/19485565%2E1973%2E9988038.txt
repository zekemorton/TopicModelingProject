Changes in Stillbirth Ratios Resulting

From Changing Fashions in Age
of Childbearing

Laurence J. Resseguie*

It has been widely observed that the
frequencies of fetal and neonatal deaths,
congenital malformations, premature births,
and maternal complications each differ with
the age at which pregnancy occurs and the
order of births. This is the first of a series
of papers in which the attempt is made to
determine the extent to which the observed
differences in rates of occurrence of problems associated with pregnancy are caused
by differences in age of the mothers and
the degree to which age-specific rates merely
reflect causal factors which are unrelated
to aging. The initial focus is on stillbirth
or Jate fetal death.

Marked differences in stillbirth ratio
with age of mother are obvious upon inspection of vital data. It is commonly assumed
that these differences reflect changes in
the risk of stillbirth to individual women as
they age. Thus, Chase (1967) asserts that
maternal age is selectively associated with
fetal mortality and therefore the age distribution of women giving birth affects the
mortality rate observed in a population.
For this reason, before comparing stillbirth

ratios in the United States to other countries, she adjusted those ratios to the levels
which would obtain if the age distributions
at birth were identical. DeHaas-Posthuma
and de Haas (1968) chose to adjust the
Dutch stillbirth ratio actually recorded in
1962-63 to the ratio which would have been
recorded had the age distribution been the
same as that which occurred in 1952-53
before comparing ratios in those years.
These and other authors routinely recognize that age and birth-order effects, if
present, are confounded in the vital data.
Tabah and Sutter (1948) attempted to
disentangle these effects and to test the
reality of each separately. They concluded
that all apparent increases in stillbirth
ratios with increasing birth order were artifactual and resulted from the real increase
in risk with increasing age. Such a conclusion forms the basis for alarm if individual
women decide to delay their pregnancies,
Other attempts to estimate age and birthorder effects typically conclude that both
are real and that there are in addition nonadditive effects resulting from interactions
between age and birth order as causal
factors (e.g., Fischler, Peritz and Wingerd,

1971). However, these analyses all rest on
the assumption that women who bear a
child at one age and parity are on the
average similar (except for age and parity)
to those bearing a child at a different age
and parity. But women of differing sociceconomic status have different risks of stillbirth at all ages and parities (Heady et al.,
1955; Kincaid, 1965; Butler and Alberman,
1969) and are not distributed similarly
among the age and parity classes. It is
doubtful that the average woman who has
her first recorded birth at age 40 was twenty
years earlier physiologically comparable to
the members of her cohort who were bearing
their first child at the age of twenty.

If we are to predict the consequences of
decisions of individual women to bear their
children at different ages, we must attempt
to analyze the association of stillbirth ratio
with age in a manner that permits estimates
of the part of that association which is the
result of changes in individual women as
they age and that part which is the result
of unequal representation among age classes of women who inherently have a high
risk of fetal loss. The present study applies
the idea presented by Illsley (1967) that
each combination of age and parity has
its own composition in terms of social
and biological characteristics and that the
pregnancy outcome which is experienced results both from effects of aging and parity
and from effects which are attributable to
the social and biological composition of
the group. Prominent among the social
factors should be the tendency of both the
youngest mothers and the grand multiparae
to come from lower social groups and to be
generally less healthy. Among the expected
biological factors would be the overrepresentation of chronic aborters at low parity
with advanced age.

James (1968) has concluded that the
increasing stillbirth ratio with increasing
birth rank after the minimum at second

 

Social Biology

birth is not primarily due to secular changes
within individual women, but to the overrepresentation at higher birth order of
women who had been stillbirth prone at
all times. Because any rapidly rising risk
with increasing age of individual women
should have produced a finding of increased
risk at higher birth orders, his analysis
provides grounds for doubting that there
is such an age effect.

The present paper develops an attempt to
estimate effects of changing patterns of
childbearing on age and birth order specific
stillbirth ratios from analysis of published
vital data. Work in progress attempts to
estimate changes in risk to individual
women as they age based on the analysis of
pregnancy outcome of the same women at
different ages.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE
HYPOTHESIS

Attempts to compare stillbirth ratios
among nations are complicated by varying
definitions. Many countries follow the convention of the United Nations and define
a late fetal death as one whose gestation
period has been at least 28 weeks. The
United States, however, includes gestations
as short as 20 weeks. France chooses to
report only legitimate births. Regardless
of the convention adopted, the completeness of reporting is highly variable and
generally not precisely known. In this
paper some of the problems are reduced by
using a relative stillbirth ratio which is
obtained by dividing the reported ratio for
the age or age parity group by the ratio
for all recorded births in the country.

It has been traditional to estimate the
changing risk of stillbirth as individual
women age from Table 1. Thus, we can
estimate that a woman in the United States
who might have borne a child at age 22 is
subject to a 57.5% increase in the probability of late fetal death if she decides to

defer that pregnancy until age 32. Fundamental to this estimate is the assumption
that stillbirth ratios calculated for the age
groups from vital data reflect physiological
changes occurring with age within individual women. Comparison of the age changes
in ratios between Canada and the United
States reveals a strongly similar pattern.
The minimum stillbirth ratio occurs in the
early twenties. Before that, women are presumed not to have reached their physiological optimum for childbearing and after
that are presumed progressively to deteriorate.

Examination of the patterns in England
and Wales, France, and Ireland reveals both
similarities and differences. The minimum
loss rate is again found in age 20-24. The
rate of deterioration with advancing age is,
however, notably slower. On the other hand,
the reproductive performance of the under20 group tends to be worse than in the
United States, especially in Ireland. Japan

provides a greater contrast. The age of
minimum loss is shifted to the late twenties,
while loss rates are very high for young
mothers, and the rate of apparent deterioration after 35 is very steep. While these contrasts among countries might reflect basic
differences in physiological changes with
age, we may reasonably suspect that a
major part of the difference is caused by
cultural dissimilarities.

One pertinent cultural factor is displayed
in Table 2. Within each country, age groups
which account for large fractions of the
births have low stillbirth ratios while age
groups with few births have a high loss rate.
Japan, which has the highest stillbirth ratio
under 20, has the fewest births in that
group. Japan alone has the minimum loss
rate in the late twenties, and Japan alone
has an intense concentration of births in
those years. The inverse relationship between stillbirth ratios and the concentration
of births by age group suggests that we

should look upon each country’s population
as composed of two classes of women:
stillbirth-prone women who exercise relatively little control over the timing or numbers of their births and stillbirth-resistant
women who constitute the substantial majority and who exercise more control over
the ages of occurrence of their births.

The stillbirth-prone women are postulated to be primarily of two distinct groups,
both of which should be disproportionately
represented among the older birth-age
groups. Women of low socioeconomic status
have elevated stillbirth ratios at all ages and
birth orders. Their births will appear widely
scattered among the age groups, but will be
a minority of births in the twenties and
early thirties when the majority of all births
occur. In the older groups, progressively
larger fractions of the births recorded will
be in this stillbirth-prone class because they
have larger families on average and tend to
bear them over a broader span of years than
is typical for the society of which they are
a part. They will be overrepresented in the
older groups and will elevate those stillbirth
ratios. They will also be disproportionately
represented among exceptionally young
mothers and high parities for all age groups.

Other women are postulated to be high
stillbirth risks for physiological reasons
which prevent them from reaching high
parity at any age. This should include a
subgroup of women whose basic defect is
genetic. These are women who have difficulty conceiving, have many spontaneous
abortions, and are also susceptible to late
fetal loss. Among the lower age groups,
their births will be a small fraction of
those reported. Among the higher ages,
their births will be a progressively greater
fraction of those recorded at the lower birth
orders, especially as first births. Thus, both
groups will contribute to the inflation of
stillbirth ratios calculated for older women,
one group at low and the other at high

Resseguie

parity. Only the low socioeconomic status
group should inflate the stillbirth ratios
among the young mothers.

A specific example of a maternal condition which contributes to the class of
physiologically stillbirth prone women is
the “Incompetent Internal Os” (Armenia,
1963). Without specific treatment, these
women lose nearly 100% of their pregnancies. Some losses occur too early in
gestation to be registered as fetal deaths.
A smaller fraction of these losses would be
registered in countries which provide for a
longer gestation period before registration
is required. With medical treatment, many
pregnancies are carried through to live
births, but the loss rate remains very great.

TEST OF THE HYPOTHESIS

One prediction of the hypothesis is that
the stillbirth ratio in a particular age class
should decline if it becomes more fashionable to bear children at that age. In order
to avoid the confounding of birth-order
effects with age effects, each combination
of mother’s age and birth order will be
treated separately. The prediction thus becomes: The stillbirth ratio for an age-birth
order class should decline if it becomes
more fashionable to bear children in that
category.

The stillbirth ratio which will be used is
the relative stillbirth ratio defined as the
stillbirth ratio for the age—birth-order class
(number of late fetal deaths/number of late
fetal deaths plus number of live births)
divided by the total stillbirth ratio for that
nation for the year. Overa)} stillbirth ratios
have dropped substantially over the period
of time considered, presumably because of
improved health and health care. Effects on
age~birth-order ratios of such secular
changes are minimized by using relative
stillbirth ratios.

The estimate of the degree to which it
was fashionable to bear a child in a specific
Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:33 08 December 2015

Vol. 20, No. 2

age—birth-order class is the relative live
birth rate. This is the actual live birth rate
specific for the age and birth order divided
by the total live birth rate for women aged
10-49 in the population for that year.
Changes in this measure reflect shifts in the
age—-birth-order specific rates relative to one
another.

The critical question thus becomes: Is
there an inverse relationship between relative stillbirth ratio and relative live birth
rate? The answer to this question will come
from examination of data for single agebirth-order combinations for single nations
over a period of years.

It has been found empirically that graphs
of relative stillbirth ratio against the natura]
log of relative live birth rate often approximate a straight line (for example, see
Figure 1). For this reason, the statistical
significance of the negative slope of the line
calculated by the method of linear regression has been adopted as the criterion for
affirming that an inverse relationship between the two variables does exist.

SOURCES OF DATA

Numbers of late fetal deaths, numbers of
live births, and live birth rate for the United
States were taken from Vital Statistics of
the United States for seventeen years from
1947 through 1967. Figures were not published for 1952, 1953, and 1954. Also, 1955
was excluded because birth order was defined differently in the published data.

Data for Japan and France were obtained
from Demographic Yearbook of the United
Nations supplemented by late fetal death
figures from Vital Statistics in Japan for
1958, 1959 and 1960 (supplied by S. Morifuku). The Japanese regressions are based
on data from seventeen years, 1951 through
1967. Prior to 1951, the data were reported
for late fetal deaths of shorter gestation.
The French regressions are based on thir

teen available years, 1951-53, 1956-8, and
1961-67.

RESULTS

Table 3 presents the results of the regression analyses for the first five orders of
birth for each of six age groups. Four
Japanese and two French age-birth-order
combinations were represented by too few
births to attempt analysis. Of the 84 completed analyses, 79 have negative regression
coefficients and 5 have positive values. None
of the five positive values approaches statistical significance and all come from data
from the United States. However, 57 of the
79 negative values are significant at the five
per cent or more stringent level.

Figures 1 through 5 display the data
points for selected categories from Table 3.
Figure 5 calls attention to results anticipated by the hypothesis. In each of the first
three birth orders for women under twenty
in France, the 1967 relative stillbirth ratio
is sharply lower than is true for the other
years and is notably lower than 1966, the
immediately preceding year. This sharp
drop in relative stillbirth ratio accompanied
a sharp increase in relative live birth rate.

This relationship is shown in greater detail in Table 4. The overall live birth rate
in 1967 continued the pattern of gradual
reduction shown for the previous years. The
overall stillbirth ratio for 1967 continued
the pattern of slow improvement typical of
the years before. The sharp drop in stillbirth ratios for the mothers under twenty is
associated with the sharp increase in live
birth rate for the same group. In contrast,
the stillbirth ratio for mothers age 25-29
increased in the same year as the live birth
rate for that group dropped.

DISCUSSION

The postulated negative relationship between relative live birth rate and relative
stillbirth rate clearly existed for the United

birth ratio observed for a combination of
mother’s age and order of birth can be profoundly affected by changing fashions in
the ages at which women within one society
prefer to bear their children. This further
indicates that vital data from these societies
cannot be used to estimate a postulated
biological effect of aging or parity on the
risk of stillbirth. It further follows that the
common practice in comparing stillbirth
ratios between nations of standardizing
those rates for differences in ages and birth
orders between the nations is unwarranted.

This does not mean that there are necessarily no effects properly attributable to age
or order of birth. It does mean that any

attempt to estimate these effects must be
made from different kinds of data. Such an
attempt is now in progress.

Restraint must be exercised in utilizing
the regression analyses in this paper. The
linearity is only an approximation within
the range of the existing data. Extrapolation
beyond the range of these data is unwarranted, It is proposed that the relationship
between relative stillbirth ratio and relative
live birth rate is the consequence of the
occurrence of a relatively stable distribution
of stillbirths experienced by stillbirth-prone
women while the number of live births in
any age-order group fluctuates widely in
response to changing preferences among the

majority of  stillbirth-resistant women.
Social changes could upset the stability of
the numerator and thereby destroy the
linearity even within the range of live birth
rates represented in the data. The rapidly
expanding availability of inexpensive and
safe abortions in recent years in the United
States might have the effect of importantly
reducing the contribution of women of low
socioeconomic status to the numbers of stillbirths observed. The expected consequence
would be that the relative stillbirth ratio
should fall to a level lower than predicted
by the regression analysis based on earlier
years. The age-birth-order classes which

Social Biology

should be most strongly affected would be
the higher birth orders at low age of mother.

There is no reason to anticipate that the
regression lines for different societies for one
combination of age of mother and order of
birth should be similar because the form of
the line is determined by social forces which
are likely to differ among the nations.
