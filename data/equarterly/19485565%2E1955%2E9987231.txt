O l N C E MONOZYGOTIC TWINS ARE IN GENERAL
more similar than dizygotics, the margin of difference in similarity has often been used as an indicator of genetic influence. Thus, if monozygotic pairs correlate .90 in variable X and .60 in a measure of Y, and if dizygotics correlate .60 in each of these characteristics, at least tentative inferences may be drawn as to the greater importance of hereditary factors in determining individual differences in X.
Attempts have been made to use such correlation data for precise estimates of the relative weight of genetic and environmental factors (2); current theory, however, is no longer oriented toward quantitative research on "proportional contributions." In the case of twins, a given degree of similarity may express an unknown mixture of common hereditary and common environmental factors, and the inference that the greater similarity of monozygotics is wholly due to direct genetic effects disregards the possibility that these twins have not only a more similar heredity but also a more similar environment.
The present study is concerned with general aspects of this problem with reference to the social environment, and involves a statistical re-analysis of data for 100 members of twin pairs, previously studied (4) at the Institute of Child Welfare, University of California. Twenty-five pairs of monozygotic twins were compared with 25 same-sex dizygotes falling within the same range as to grade in school, and social status (occupational rating) of the father.1
1The diagnosis of twin types was based on six ot Newman's (6) criteria: monozygotic twins must be

Nine pairs of each type were males, 16 were females. The majority of the cases (15 pairs of each type) were in the age range 10 to 14 years. Three of each type were between 6 and 10 years, and 7 between 14 and 18 years. All cases were located in a survey of twins in a normal public school population (8).
We are concerned here with the behavioral similarities of twins, as perceived by their mothers. Attention will be directed to the extent to which mothers differentiate twins in specific aspects of behavior. It is assumed that perceptual differentiation implies different social reputations, which may be not merely an outcome of behavior differences but to some degree a determinant of continuing differences.
Each mother was interviewed by a staff member2 who attempted to elicit a free discussion of the twins which might serve as a basis for later personality studies. In the course of the interview, a specific judgment was obtained for each of 18 traits, as to whether or not the twins showed a perceived difference. The form of the question, at this point, was designed to bring out even slight differences: "Which one does the more talking?" "Which one usually takes the lead?" "Which one is better at taking a joke?" etc. Some mothers were sufficiently discriminating to state their judg-
similar in general appearance; essentially identical in hair color, texture and form; have the same shade of eye color and form of iris; have the same skin color and texture (except for differences due to tanning); show no marked differences in features, shape of ears, or shape, size and arrangement of teeth; have hands of the same type, nearly equal

merits in terms of specific situations --
"Jack is more talkative with other children,
but Jim seems to do more of the talking
when adults are around."
In general it was not found to be feasible,
in a first interview, to force decisions in
terms of numerous concretely described
stimulus-response units. This is not neces-
sarily a defect of the inquiry, since our pri-
mary purpose was to obtain global esti-
mates which, if different for the two twins,
might operate as different stereotypes. In a
few instances the mother's report on a spe-
cific trait was inconsistent or uninterpreta-
ble, and was not used.
Following are the specific questions in-
cluded in each interview:
1. Sympathy -- "Which one would you say is the more sympathetic?"
2. Perseverance--"Which has the more perseverance, the more stick-to-itiveness?"
3. Attention--"Which one is the more attentive and alert?"
4. Promptness -- "Which one is more punctual and more prompt in carrying out requests?"
5. Self-assertion -- "Which one is the more self-assertive, the more forward?"
6. Talkativeness -- "Which one does the more talking?"
7. Self-consciousness -- "Which one is the more self-conscious -- more inclined to be shy and bashful?"
8. Memory--"Which one has the better memory?"
9. Sense of responsibility -- "Which one shows the greater sense of responsibility?"
10. Sense of humor -- "Which one is better at taking a joke?"
11. Irritability--"Which one is the less irritable--the less quick tempered?"
12. Sociability --"Which child is the more interested in playing with other children?"
13. Inventiveness -- "Which child has the better imagination? Which one is the more inventive in games and make-believe?"
14. Leadership -- "Which one usually takes the lead?"
15. Social adaptability -- "Which one

gets along better with the other children?" 16. Athletic interests -- "Which one is the more interested in athletic games and sports?" 17. Dependence on each other--"Which one is the more dependent on the other, for assistance or companionship?" 18. Impulsiveness -- "Which one is the more impulsive--makes up his mind quicker or acts more suddenly?"
Some additional questions, dealing with
differences in "preference for parents," "de-
pendence on parents" and other character-
istics such as "obstinacy" were also included
in the first few interviews, but were
dropped from the schedule when they were
found to present difficulties in the initial
interview.

A wide variation may be noted among these traits, in the frequency of intra-pair differences. These monozygotic twins are apparently not easily differentiated in such traits as inventiveness, memory or promptness, or in sociability or athletic interests. But perceptible differences are noted, more often than not, in impulsiveness and in leadership. The range of trait differences might be interpreted in terms of marked or little susceptibility to environmental differentia, within this twin population. The trait differences, however, cannot be taken at their face value, since they are probably affected by the variability of traits in individuals. Thus, a trait may have very limited dispersion because environmental factors have enforced a social norm in its expression (e.g., athletic interests). In such a case few intra-pair differences will be noted, because the mothers cannot discriminate the relevant cues, or cannot assess them reliably.

To deal with such problems, it is obvious that a much more extensive study is needed, with more cases and with a repetition of the interview in order to determine the reliability of judgments. However, our present concern is chiefly in the comparison of results for the two types of twins, under conditions which involve similar limitations on the same traits.

Table 2 presents data for dizygotic twins,
in the same form as Table 1, but rank-
ordered according to the frequency of differences in this second group.3
3A tendency may be noted for traits to show similar intra-pair differences in the two populations, but with some marked displacements in the rankorder. Rho is .60, significant at the .01 level. The use of correlation is open to question, since the number of pairs involved varies slightly in the different traits.

It can be seen that the mean intra-pair difference tends to be somewhat higher in the second group. In Table 1, the mean per cent is 43.2, in Table 2, 55.5 per cent. Among the dizygotics, the most commonly perceived differences are in attention, irritability, and responsibility. Sociability, inventiveness, and athletic interests are among the five traits with the fewest intrapair differences, for both types of twins.
A more detailed comparison is given in Table 3, which presents the traits in a rankorder according to the degree to which dizygotic differences exceed the monozygotic. The dizygotics show greater intrapair differences in 14 of the 18 traits, but the second-order difference is significant for only the first four traits. Three out of five of the dizygotic pairs, and only one out of five of the monozygotics, show differences in reported "promptness." In the traits of "attention" and "memory," reported differences are two to three times more frequent among the dizygotics. These are characteristics which may provide a better objective basis for comparison than in the case of some of the traits lower in the list, such as "impulsiveness." The first three characteristics are also related to intelligence, and

the results obtained are congruent with the well-known tendency for twin correlations in IQ to be higher among monozygotic twins (3, p. 674). Moderate second-order differences occur for such personal traits as irritability, responsibility and self-assertion, and very little difference for such social traits as adaptability and sense of humor.
Some interest attaches to the fact that in dependence on each other and in leadership the monozygotics, reversing the usual rule, show greater obtained differences than the dizygotics. The hypothesis may be offered that the closeness of relationship among the monozygotics is a factor which promotes greater similarity in interests, attitudes and activities, but at the same time a greater differentiation of their mutual social roles. This may be less often true among dizygotics, whose social activities more frequently lead them into different groups.
Summary
1. Twenty-five pairs of monozygotic twins were compared with 25 pairs of samesex dizygotics, controlled with regard to age, sex, and social and educational status.

2. Through interviews with their mothers, information was obtained concerning perceived intra-pair differences in 18 reputation traits. The data are based on a standard series of open-ended interview items.
3. Among monozygotics, the percentage of pairs reported as different ranged in different traits from 8 to 75 per cent, with an average frequency of 43.2. Among same-sex dizygotics, the corresponding values ranged from 16 to 83, with a mean of 55.5.
4. On individual traits significant differences {i.e.,significantly greater disparity among dizygotics than among monozygotics) were for the most part restricted to traits related to intelligence, in this particular selection of traits.
5. On social characteristics such as sociability, social adaptability, etc., little evidence was found for greater similarity among the monozygotics.
6. Although greater intra-pair differences were found among dizygotics in 14 out of 18 traits, the rank-order of these differences is in general similar in thetwo types of twins. Factors contributing to this similarity are discussed.

Conclusion
With reference to the initial problem of this study, evidence is shown that monozygotic twins tend to be more often perceived as alike in reputation traits. This greater similarity, however, applies very unequally to different traits. For present purposes, we are less concerned with the source of these patterned similarities than with their potential effect, namely, an environmental stereotyping which may tend to be somewhat greater within monozygotic than within dizygotic twin pairs.
This calls in question the assumptions which have sometimes been made (1, 2, 5, 7) that the "average nurture difference" is the same for the two types of twins. If the monozygotic, more than the dizygotic, develop in an environment which recognizes and expects greater similarity in behavioral traits, this may be a fact of some importance (differentially for different traits) in maintaining or increasing their similarity. Emphasis on this point is less needed now than was the case in earlier studies, but we must continue research in this area if we are to define the detailed operation of the stereotyping process where it occurs.
