INTRODUCTION
Studies of contrasts between different populations or racial groups in the frequencies of diminished acuity of a sensory function are beset by many difficulties and dangers. Contrasts which may appear to reflect constitutional or hereditary differences between a pair of populations are almost always open to alternative interpretations, to mention but one difficulty. Nevertheless a few such studies can be cited for two functions which might merit consideration-- color vision and general vision acuity (Post, 1962a, b). Since population analysis occasionally offers an illustration of evolutionary process, it is tempting to review the literature of a third function, that of mild losses in hearing threshold. The difficulties in this field are even greater than in overall vision acuity and far greater than in "colorblindness"; the role of heredity and the influences of environmental factors are little understood and always baffling; audiometric studies of populations are but five in number, some of which are based on small samples and therefore inconclusive, while the largest includes data from various types of tests. Nevertheless, these studies concern the very essence of evolution. The present review of hearing acuity in populations is therefore undertaken.
HEARING TESTS AT THE 1939 WORLD FAIRS
The largest population study which has been found was that made by the

Bell Telephone System at the World Fairs of New York and San Francisco in 1939 (Montgomery, 1939; Steinberg, Montgomery and Gardner, 1940). While the samples are not considered representative of the American people, one would surmise that approximately the same conditions of ascertainment applied to Negroes and "others" as to whites. The subjects were tested in sound-insulated booths. Instruction was given by phonograph record heard by earphone, followed by the test, consisting of pure sounds at five different tonal frequencies--viz., 440, 880, 1,760, 3,520, and 7,040 cycles per second (cps.)--each sounded nine times at successively fainter intensities. The results are presented in Table 1, in terms of mean loss in decibels for forty subsamples--viz., two sexes, five tonal frequencies, and four age levels. A negative mean indicates "superior" hearing since zero represents "standard" or "normal" hearing loss. Racial classification was made by the attendants who received the score sheets and not from statements of the subjects. The data for Negroes and for "others" were supplied very kindly by Dr. H. C. Montgomery by personal communication and are here reported for the first time (Table 1).
In the forty comparisons between subsamples of Negroes and whites the former have a higher mean hearing loss (N>wh) in thirty, the latter (wh>N) in ten. Those differences between paired means of Negro and white subsamples

do not seem large when subjectively compared with the standard deviations of the white subsamples (third column, Table 1--the only estimates of dispersion that were available) but several of the differences appear impressive in comparison with the corresponding means. The statistical significance of the differences cannot be tested, since no standard deviations aTe reported for the Negro subsamples. The ratios of mean white loss to mean Negro loss are shown in the last column. The 23 subsamples showing interpopulation differences of two decibels or over are repeated below, ranked in order of magnitude of the difference. Details are in Table 1, whence the following are taken:

Perhaps the most striking observation is the association of greater Negro hearing losses (N>wh) with lower tonal frequencies, viz. 440 and 880 cps., and of greater hearing losses among whites (wh>N) with higher tones--viz., 7,040 and 3,520 cps. Further, these more substantial differences are associated with

the older age groups, from 30 to 49, and are slightly more pronounced among males than females. In the body of Table 1 it is also observed that whereas Negroes and whites both exhibit generally higher losses at older ages than at younger (presbycusis), the Negro males do not show the marked drop at 3,520 cps. characteristic of older whites.
In sum, it is observed that these samples of Negroes are inclined to have inferior acuity vis-a-vis whites at the lower tonal frequencies (below 3,520 cps.) and superior acuity at higher frequencies. Both of these differences are found in both sexes, particularly at ages 30 and over, but perhaps they are more pronounced in males. Both observations are noted by Montgomery in his private communication, which quite properly includes the warning: "Because of the small samples and the possibility of selective factors producing a bias in the results, one should be cautious in drawing conclusions. . . . "
(It should be noted that the terms "superior" and "inferior" as used in some of these studies with reference to two contrasted populations indicate merely that the mean hearing loss in decibels of one sample is greater or less than the mean of another. It would be more precise to use these terms with reference to the relative position of the modes, but these are not always reported. If two samples should have modes centering at the same point such as zero loss, yet one mean is also at zero and the other at 1 or 2 decibels, the second sample must have a higher frequency of persons with hearing defect. It would not seem precise to call the second sample "inferior" when only a minority of its members merit the term. Such terms as "higher" or "lower mean performance" would be preferable.)

HOSPITAL PATIENTS
The earliest study of race differences in hearing loss which has been found in the literature was made on patients in the medical and surgical departments of the Johns Hopkins Hospital (Bunch and Raiford, 1931). While noise conditions in the wards and in the room set aside for audiometric testing were not ideal, the conditions were similar for both races, and the possibility of racial bias in ascertainment seems low. Samples were divided into four 10-year age groups, from 20 through 59; subjects were tested at eleven or twelve pitches beginning at 32 cps. and multiples thereof up to 4,096 cps., also at 5,793, 8,192, and 10,321 cps. The chief results are summarized in Table 2.
Hearing losses in decibels among females are observed to be fairly similar for both races at all pitches and age levels. Among males the race differences are negligible at low pitches for three of the four age levels, but white males show a slight superiority in four subgroups, all in the 30-year group, amounting to 3 db. at 32 cps. and 64 cps. and to 2 db. at 128 cps. and 256 cps. However, the Negro males show a rather marked superiority at the higher pitches and age levels. This superiority tends to increase with both ascending pitch and greater age. Negro superiority of two decibels or over are shown in fourteen subgroups. All are at the higher pitches. They are listed in order of magnitude, from Table 2, at top of next column.
Although subsample sizes are small, the consistency in the superiority of Negro males over white males in the three older age groups at pitches of 4,096 cps. and above, is notable. Less marked is the superiority of Negro males over Negro females at lower pitches (such as under 2,048 cps.). Thirdly, one ob-

serves a superiority of Negro females over Negro males at higher pitches (4,096 and over) for all ages except the three oldest levels--a situation which is well known among whites. Both races also demonstrate presbycusis in both sexes at the higher pitches. The last two observations tend to increase one's confidence in the study, despite the small sample sizes and the absence of standard deviations.

ARMED SERVICES DRAFTEES, 1 9 4 0 - 1 9 4 4
Although the statistics of "ear defects" (including "defective hearing") of drafted men examined during the Second World War have many weaknesses, it may be of some value to note the magnitude of the differences in rates between Negroes and whites, also the relative constancy of these differences among various states and cities.
The data made available by the Selective Service System (U.S., Statistics, 1945) have several limitations. There are only two tables in which the rubric "Defects of the Ear, Nose and Throat" is subdivided. These are in Volume 3, section "Summary Reports," Subsection "Defects of the Ear, Nose and Throat," Tables 3 and 5. They are summarized on p. 68.
These results parallel those obtained from examinations of World War I

drafted men (Love et al., 1958,pp. 75-78).
The relative excess in defective hearing rate of "whites" over Negroes apparently increases with age, since the ratio of 1.43 for all ages is subdivided by the three age groups 18-25, 26-29, and 30andover into theratios 1.29, 1.39, and 1.68, respectively. This trend was observed in the two previous studies. In vision acuity, also, an increase inthe ratio of defect rates among "whites" as compared with Negroes has been noted in proportion to age (Karpinos, 1944, p. 11;Post, 1962b, p. 202).
The racial contrasts in national rates is emphasized in its consistency among several states and cities (Table 3, for which these rates were computed. They are tabulated here for the first time). Of the28 states and 36cities wherein the number of men tested exceeded 1,000 for either race, only 5 states and only 8 cities have ratios below unity--i.e. a lower rate for whites than for Negroes. The frequency distribution of the ratios follows in the table opposite.
Two rather obvious suggestions in explanation of the "superiority" of Negro draftees might be: (1) that whites were more apt to feign hearing defects in order to avoid military service, forone

reason or another--possibly some Negroes welcomed its social status; (2) that American Negroes must be slightly more highly selected, robust, healthy, etc.,in general than their white compatriots simply in order to attain the ages of drafted men, because of the greater ardors of their environment; and this general "superiority" might be reflected in special functions, such as hearing.
On further reflection, the higher rates of defective hearing among whites may be associated with their higher rates of otitis media, which are marked. The diagnosis of otitis media would seem to be reasonably objective. This point loses significance, however, in the light ofthe fact that otitis media andminor perforation of the ear drum both produce hearing loss at lower tones, whereas white

males are observed to have more frequent losses at higher tones.
Because of the limitations of these data, especially because most of the tests were made by the whispered voice, they should be regarded with caution. It is believed that the armed services are overcoming some of these limitations currently.
PEOPLE OF A PRIMITIVE CULTURE IN A
RELATIVELY NOISE-FREE HABITAT
The most recent and most impressive population study of hearing threshold was completed in 1962 on a sample of 541 unselected Negroes in the Sudan --the Mabaans. They live in an "unspoiled" hunting and farming culture, almost completely free from ear-damaging noises. They have no guns, nor even drums. Audiometers were capable of testing thresholds from minima of minus 20 decibels. Physical examinations revealed a healthy, well-nourished population, remarkable for its low blood pressure. Chief results are presented in Table 4 and Figures 1-4.

In Figures 1 and 2 the median audiometric scores for seven 10-year age groups, respectively males and females, are compared with those of American whites tested in 1954 at the Wisconsin State Fair. Separate comparisons are made at each of seven tones, from 500 cps. through 6,000 cps. It is noted that the median scores of the Mabaan subsamples are superior to those of the corresponding samples of whites in all seven age groups and at all tones. This superiority is progressively more marked in proportion to both greater age and higher tonal frequency, particularly among males. The widest margins of superiority of these Sudanese Negroes over the white "controls" are noted in the two oldest age groups of males, at the two highest tones.
In Figures 3 and 4 each Mabaan median score is compared with an average of the medians of three samples of American whites. Each point on the curve of each age group represents its relative departure from the median of the 20-29 year group, which serves as a base. While the differences between

ear" which differentiates Americans. Other factors they suggest include diet, climate, and race per se. "Might not the stress and strain which afflicts modern civilized man somehow affect all his senses, including hearing? Is it as safe now (after examining these results) to assume that normal human hearing for a given age is the same, wherever on earth it may be tested?"
Two more hypotheses may be suggested. The Mabaans might train their children and youths to greater sensitivity, either by deliberate instruction or unconsciously, through active participation in the normal life of their out-ofdoor, quasi-hunting habitat. Finally, as far as the Mabaans' superiority may be genetically determined, if they have a relatively higher frequency of "good" genes (a situation almost equivalent to the whites having a relatively higher frequency of "bad" genes) the difference might be due to a relaxation among white populations in the rates of elimi-

nation of the "bad" genes by natural selection, during the many generations which have elapsed since they quit a more primitive habitat.
This study is outstanding in many ways, particularly the large sample sizes, the sharply differentiated environments, the very low noise background of the subjects throughout their lives, and the technical details of the audiometric testing. Since Mabaans and whites differ in both race and environment, however, no final explanation of their differences is possible.
A subsequent study at 12,000 and 24,000 cps. indicates "a growing disparity in favor of the Mabaans" with aging, at these two very high tones, continuing the pattern presented above (Rosen et al., 1964).

of four elementary schools in Pittsburgh has shown no consistency in the differences between Negroes and whites. Of 3,882 children tested between June 1958 and June 1959, 2,747 were white and 1,135 nonwhite, the sexes divided about equally. Tests were made in prefabricated, doubly insulated rooms at seven frequencies, from 250 cps.through 8,000 cps. (Eagles and Wishik, 1961).
Regarding their data on the two racial groups which have not yet been reported, the senior author has most kindly commented as follows by personal communication:
Our more recent analysis of hearing levels in over 4,000 children revealed no significant difference between whites and nonwhites in the age group 5 through 14 years. It is true that there are small differences and that these are statistically significant; but there is no constant direction to the differences, and they are not measurable audiometrically.

the five studies outlined above may be summarized as follows in table below.
Because of environmental differences in all five studies and the ever present possibility of bias in sampling of both races, no definite statement regarding race difference per se is justified. But the data consistently suggest that at higher tones, hearing defects or losses may be more frequent among whites than Negroes, beginning at about age 30, progressively at older ages, particularly among males. At lower tones Negroes may have more frequent defects at age 30 and older, but this difference is noted in only two studies and is slight, while it is contradicted in a third study.
The absence of differences among children need not detract from the significance of those among adults. Many traits of race are less pronounced or absent among children, and many hereditary traits which are not necessarily racial, some of them pathological, are not manifested at younger ages.

is virtually unknown. The few studies found are aimed at identifying hypothetical heterozygote "carriers" among the relatives of congenitally deaf personssuspected of being homozygote "recessives." While most of the authors fail to distinguish carriers from unrelated normal controls by audiometric testing and some feel that this may be impossible, a few claim success (Wedenberg, 1959, and others cited by Stevenson and Cheeseman, 1956).
A study of audiometric thresholds of 41 monozygous (MZ) and 29 like-sexed dizygous (DZ) twin pairs aged 12-20 and selected essentially at random which is being prepared for publication elsewhere may now be summarized. While matched intrapair differences at three low and middle tones show prevailing homogeneity in Chi square tests of the numbers of concordant and discordant pairs of the two types of twins, at a fourth tone, the highest (11,584 cycles per second), a slight degree of heterogeneity is suggested. Therefore the computation of an estimate of heritability at this tone is warranted. Since the definition of "concordance" is necessarily arbitrary, tests of heterogeneity were made at every feasible level. The data permit three such levels:
A. A matched twin pair of ears, both right ears or both left ears, was termed concordant if the difference between them was zero or 5 decibels, discordant if 10 db. or over 10 (all audiometric scores being recorded in units of 5db.).
B. Similarly, a difference of 0 or 5 or 10 db. constitutes concordance, a difference of 15 db. or over, discordance.
C. Similarly, zero through 15 db. constitutes concordance.
Of the 24 Chi squares for heterogeneity--four tones, three levels of concordance, separately for left ears and right

ears--only two are high enough to indicate a probability of 5% or less that the higher concordance rate found among the MZ pairs as contrasted with the rate among the DZ pairs is due to chance alone; i.e. x2 of 3.84 with one degree of freedom for the two by two table. A third x2 approaches the 5% level of significance closely, being 3.7.In the following array of Chi squares these three are underlined, each followed by the corresponding estimate of heritability, in parenthesis (from the standard formula, H=percent of concordance among MZ pairs minus percent among DZ pairs, this difference divided by 100% minus the per cent of concordance among DZ pairs). Chi squares less than 1 are omitted from the array:

While heritability estimates of .55, .47, and .69 may appear to be appreciable, they can hardly be considered significant because of the low Chi squares for heterogeneity with which each is associated. Since 21 of the 24 Chi squares of the array are lower still, the overall evidence for heritability is indeed low and must be considered as merely suggestive. A more sensitive audiometer, capable of testing at fainter sound intensities and recordable in units of 2 or 3 decibels rather than units of 5, might yield higher estimates of heritability. Possibly then a greater degree of heritability might be differentiated at higher tones than at lower, as is suspected.
DISCUSSION
Although the principal observation of these studies is far from being confirmed, that white males of middle age or older may have less acute hearing (or, at least, higher frequencies of mild hearing loss) than Negro males of corresponding age at higher tones (but not at lower tones), still it is tempting to entertain possible explanations.
Since the environmental factors which produce race differences in hearing acuity are of less concern to evolution and eugenics than the hereditary factors, the former will not concern our speculation here (not to imply that we have any appreciable knowledge about either). The suggestion of higher heritability of acuity at higher tonal frequency than at lower tones, slight though it be, gives encouragement to genetic hypotheses. Two such suggest themselves, one of positive selection, the other of relaxed selection.
The more obvious hypothesis is that of greater adaptation in hearing of Negroes to their erstwhile habitat, because they may have had higher rates of na-

tural selection than those of whites in a quite different area, during the many generations which have elapsed since the two groups of populations became geographically separated. At least two series of assumptions are needed here: (1) That hearing acuity for either race-- particularly at higher tones--is critical for survival in "natural" habitats. Perhaps sounds such as the "swish" of grass under the stealthy feet of predators and human enemies, or of branches of trees and shrubs as light breezes blow or a stalking body passes by, are apt to produce sounds of higher tones. Such important sounds as the whispered voice (Huizinga, 1958), the nights of arrows, the "hiss" of certain snakes and insects are known to be of higher tones. These assumptions are supported by the marked superiority of several other mammals to man, especially at the highest tonal frequencies, such as of dogs, cats, and rats. (2) That Negroes have evolved in habitats where very faint sounds are more important to survival than in the white populations' habitats. For example, Negroes may have evolved for more generations in closer relationship with animal predators or other dangers which give warning sounds, particularly if these sounds should have higher tones. (3) As a theoretical alternative, the possibility must be mentioned of differences between populations in the mutation rates of genes which affect hearing acuity; but this assumption seems most unlikely.
The hypothesis of relaxed selection depends on assumptions which may be more difficult to sustain. First, certain aspects of the white populations' habitats might have been affected by the growth of culture to greater degrees than among the Negroes. Probably the neolithic revolution with the development of pastoralism and agriculture had some

effects on selection rates for hearing; and if so, it might seem that most of the rates would have decreased, but some more than others. If such a decrease was more marked in the New Stone Age of the whites, or if it commenced earlier and thus has been operating longer, their inferiority of hearing would be expected. Judgment on any such question must await much further advance in the ethnology and archeology of Africa and Europe.
This situation may be illustrated by the variation among populations in the frequencies of sex-linked color vision deficiencies. There are four specific entities, each under simple genetic control: deuteranopia and deuteranomaly (severe and moderate "green blindness"), protanopia and protanomaly (severe and moderate "red blindness"). The frequency of each ranges from three to five times higher among "civilized" Asians and Europeans than among "primitives" in hunting culture-habitats. The evidence for selection relaxation is circumstantial and rests on assumptions for which there is no empiric demonstration as yet, but the case seems reasonable (Dronamraju, 1963; Neel and Post, 1963).
Vision acuity defects also occur more frequently among the "civilized" than among hunter-gatherers. Although the genetic bases for the gamut of entities composing vision acuity are far from being understood and are undoubtedly most complicated, the overall heritability component in defective vision appears sufficiently high to justify arguing another case for relaxation, under assumptions which again seem plausible (DukeElder, 1949; Post, 1962b; Sorsby, 1962; Miller, 1963).
A third case for relaxation can be argued in the reduced size of teeth of Europeans, especially in the eastern

Mediterranean area (Dahlberg, 1960, 1963), compared with those of certain hunting peoples.
Satisfactory demonstration of relaxed selection among civilized populations in a trait or function as markedly influenced by environmental variation as hearing acuity must depend upon extraordinary procedure. One suggestion may be offered which might make a small contribution towards cutting the Gordian Knot of the nature-nurture problem. If relaxation can be demonstrated among civilized as contrasted with hunting populations in a genetically controlled trait or function which seems to be virtually immune to environmental influences in modern habitats, such as sex-linked "colorblindness," and if the same populations are observed to show similar contrasts in the frequencies of other genetically controlled traits of functions, such as acuity of hearing or vision, then a partial demonstration might be conceded. Four samples of African Negro populations aggregating 2,749 tested males have gene frequency estimates for protan and deuteran mutants of .01 and .03, respectively. Corresponding figures for seven samples of Europeans aggregating 22,518 tested males are .02 and .06 (Post, 1962a). These European populations may be said to have accumulated approximately twice the frequencies of color vision deficiency producing alleles at two separate loci as the Negro populations. Insofar as the Europeans have an appreciably longer history of habitats where color vision defect may be assumed to have been under no selective disadvantage, this difference may be attributed to relaxed selection. The parallel would be stronger if the very same samples of hunters and civilized were examined simultaneously for "colorblindness," vision acuity, and hear-

ing acuity, a task which has not yet been undertaken. Clearer results might be expected by contrasting pairs of populations having greater extremes of cultural histories than those of American whites and Negroes, such as one Asian or European population versus one of the aborigines of Australia, New Guinea, or the Arctic Circle.
Some compensation for the weakness of the demonstration of relaxation in hearing may be found in two of the very factors which limit the demonstration. (1) Slight defects in hearing may be due to mutation of any of a very large number of genes. (2) The selective forces operating against some of these mutants in a hunting culture-habitat may be very weak indeed. The selective disadvantage of any one might be only 2% or 3% for instance. Mutants which are harmful to such slight degrees, upon accumulation in habitats with diminished selection rates or complete relaxation of selection, would produce hearing defects which are usually most slight. There is no compensation, however, in the realization that the aggregate genetic load of these "microgenes" might be considerable, since each mutant would survive much longer than a mutant with more striking effects.
SUMMARY
Five studies are reviewed in which estimates of the frequencies of mild hearing losses in samples of Negroes and whites are compared. In four of the five, samples of whites are observed to have higher frequencies of hearing loss at the higher tones, at ages of approximately 30 and over, especially among males. In two studies, Negroes have higher frequencies of loss than whites at lower tones. The second type of difference is also limited to ages of 30 and over, and

is more marked among males, but is not so marked on the whole as the first type at higher tones. In the fifth study, limited to children, no consistent trend of race difference is demonstrable.
To whatever extent the Negro samples have admixtures of white ancestry, genetic differences between the two races may be considered minimal estimates. The white component in certain large studies of race mixture in the United States has been estimated to be from one fifth to one quarter (Glass, 1955; Roberts, 1955).
The reliability and significance of the first type of difference is discussed, and two explanations are tentatively offered: greater degrees of progressive adaptation of Negroes, through higher selection rates over longer periods of time; and (or) relaxed selection rates among the whites. Both explanations depend on assumptions for which there is no demonstrable evidence, but both appear reasonable.
