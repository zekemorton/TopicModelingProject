it seemed best to set up any such project

By 1949, in Puerto Rico there were over one hundred maternal-health (birth-control) clinics in operation in Health Department facilities throughout the Island. They were recognized as a responsibility of the Department, in the same way that prenatal and postpartum supervision was rendered by the Health Department. Advice and medical examinations were given by the Health Officer to women who requested information on contraception, and. supplies were provided without cost to the

within the framework of the organized health department so that if positive results were obtained they could possibly have wide application. In addition to an investigation of the types of administrative practice which would be effective in such a program, it was hoped that an answer would be obtained to two questions: (1) what method, or methods, are most acceptable to the rural population of Puerto Rico and (2) where can instruction best be given in a tropical area with low levels of education and economy. It would have

been profitable to determine the efficacy of each method, but this appeared impractical within the circumstances of the study. The value of this investigation was predicated upon the assumption that birth-control

procedures of previously demonstrated effectiveness, if used consistently, are more efficacious in controlling fertility than the potentially most efficacious method when used incorrectly, or only occasionally.
The site chosen for the experiment was a municipio with an area of approximately 20 square miles, and located 25 miles from San Juan. The population according to the 1940 census was 11,664, of whom 1,040 lived in the poblacion or urban area. The comparable figures for 1950 were 13,605 and 1,080. The main occupation of the inhabitants is agriculture. Of 4,740 adults, 25 years old and over, 3,517 or 74 per cent completed less than five years of school, and 1,612 or 34 per cent had no schooling at all.1 In 1949 as part of the Health Center development program of the Island a combined center (preventive, curative and welfare services) was constructed. Two full-time physicians appointed by the Commonwealth Department of Health provide clinical and public health services, and there are 13 beds. Operations such as appendectomies and sterilizations by the Pomeroy method are carried out in the center. Also in 1949 a unit of the health center was set up in Barrio X, a subdivision on the other edge of the municipio from the poblacion and staffed by a public-health nurse. Each week the usual public-health clinics are held in the barrio, doctors and nurses coming over from the poblacion.
The maternal-health clinic in the poblacion started in 1939 had by November 1949 enrolled 372 patients. Within the same time the clinic in Barrio X had enrolled 23. Only 25 of the group at the poblacion and ten of those at the barrio had been seen within three months prior to November 1949. Considering that material given out at a clinic visit was, at most, sufficient for one month's supply, it will be obvious that the effectiveness of the

program in controlling unwanted birth could not be judged by the total numbers enrolled.
In December of 1949 the project funds, including support from Young's Rubber Company and Eaton Laboratories, were used to provide salaries for two additional public health nurses in the study area raising the nursing staff from three to five in the area. In addition, a jeep and driver were furnished to make home visits practical outside of the poblacion, and away from the settled area of Barrio X. It was agreed that the two extra nurses should carry out general public-health nursing duties, but their presence made it possible to increase the birth-control clinics in the poblacion from one to two per week and in the barrio weekly instead of bi-weekly clinics became possible.
Clinic Procedures
The Health Department promised to provide at all times adequate supplies of diaphragms, condoms, suppositories and contraceptive creams and jellies to be used as directed either with a diaphragm or injected by syringe. The entering patient was interviewed by the nurse and told that several methods of contraception were available. Trial of diaphragm and jelly, jelly with 5 cc. applicator, suppository or foam tablet was recommended. After the patient was examined by the physician, she was given a month's supply of the material selected.
The patient was instructed to come into the health center or sub-unit at an earlier time, if for any reason, the method was not acceptable. The nurses were authorized to make a change of method on such a visit and to give out supplies of contraceptives to clinic-registered women even outside of regular clinic hours. Since use of the condom for contraception had been the most frequent method throughout the Island, it was felt that sufficient trial had been made and thus the condom was not

among the methods offered first. If requested by the patient, such supplies were given freely. The nurses were instructed to give instructions in the rhythm method if a patient had religious objections to mechanical methods, but during the whole time covered by clinic activities there is no record of such a request. Arrangements for sterilization were sometimes facilitated, at the request of the patient, but the method was not recommended as a birth control procedure.
Every woman entering the Health Center for any reason, e.g., prenatal care, delivery, well-baby clinic, immunization, or examination for intestinal parasities was told of the existence of the maternal health clinic, and, if interested, given an appointment. At the time of the six weeks postpartum visit to the home the subject was brought up again.
A canvass was made of all birth-control cases ever known to the clinic. Many of these could be traced. A considerable number, however, made appointments to revisit the clinic and were reactivated. Unfortunately, because of the Health Department policy, the nurse was not permitted to dispense supplies on her home visit, interested patients being required to come for such materials to the Health Center at the time of the maternal-health clinic. New patients were then examined by the physician. This policy proved to be an obvious limiting factor upon the extent of the population which could be reached by birth-control methods.
In November of 1954 it was decided to test the effectiveness of allowing the nurse to give birth-control instruction and supplies to old or new patients in the homes. Project funds were made available for the salary of a nurse and driver and maintenance of a jeep. When visiting in the homes, the nurse was under the direction of a physician of the Asociacion Puertorriquena pro Bienestar de la Familia, a voluntary planned-parenthood organiza-

tion. During the maternal-health sessions within the health center she acted as one of the regular staff of the Health Department.
Project funds were also used to maintain a full stock of materials for the various methods under study. Thus no patient was required to change a method due to temporary shortage of the normal Health Department supply, nor was she prevented by shortage of supplies from choosing another method.
Visits were made monthly to those easily reached by the jeep and every two months to those more distantly located who received correspondingly larger amounts of supplies. Instructions and supplies were given to neighbors of the users whenever such services were requested.
Differential Utilization of Control Methods
A total of 2,804 months of exposure following registration was subject to recorded observation during the period 1950-1956. During 2,155 or 77 per cent of these months it was possible to determine the specific method of contraception which was used. The extent to which the several birth-control methods were employed by the patients is given in Table 1. Even though the condom was not emphasized in the initial registration procedure, it proved to be the most frequently used method. Thus the condom was the means of protection during 34 per cent of the total person months of recorded contraception. In spite of the fact that diaphragm-and-jelly was consistently urged as a particularly protective form of contraception, it proved less acceptable than the condom and the use of jelly alone, being used in 21 per cent of the contraceptive months.
Effects of Project Fertility
In the determination of the efficacy of a fertility-control project a number of comparisons suggest themselves. The fertility

rates of families before and after registration with the project can be compared. The assumption here is that in the absence of the project the pre-registration rates could be expected to prevail with little change. This thesis implies that for families capable of reproduction there were no new control forces operating other than the fertility-control project. In a rural area, with comparatively little contact with the forces molding attitudes in urban centers, the assumption stated above is of considerable validity. When the pre-registration rates are based upon a period, say, of two years, and the post-registration rates are based on a like period then the marital partners being compared would differ on the average by two years, a factor which per se is not likely to strongly affect fertility rates. However, if the pre-registration fertility rates are based upon all accumulated marital experience and the post-registration rates are based upon from 3-5 years experience, then the families compared differ considerably in mean age. A difference in fertility cannot then be attributed solely to the project but may be, in part, due to the greater age of the post-instruction group.
To avoid confusing age differences in fertility and differences attributed to a fertility-control project, age-specific fertility rates before instruction can be compared with those after instruction. Thus, for example, the fertility rate for women 25-29 years of age, prior to registration, may be

compared with the rate noted for women of this age group after registration. Obviously, the calendar years covered by these two experiences may differ considerably and the groups of women being compared are different individuals. This technique removes the effect of age upon the fertility differences observed but assumes that age-specific rates would not change other than through the introduction of the offered control measures. As indicated above, the locale of this study, isolated culturally from urban developments, would appear to be an area in which the assumption is valid.
In Table 2, the pre-registration experience is shown for 222 women who were admitted to the birth-control clinic and who were residents of Barrio X. The index of fertility used is the pregnancy rate, determined as follows:

at the time of registration gave some history of the use of contraception, observations on the fertility experience of the registered patients are given separately for those who reported previous contraception. It would appear that a history of contraception did not materially affect the fertility experience for women below 25 years of age. This is not to be interpreted as indicating poor results for use of contraceptive methods by these young wives. It is more likely that contraception was started late in marital life, when at least three children had already been conceived and reared past infancy. Although there is some inconsistency in results for women aged 25 years and over, who gave a history of contraception, this group when considered as a whole had a pregnancy rate of 48 per 100 years of exposure as contrasted with a rate of 67 for those with no such history, a reduction in fertility of 28 per cent.
Pregnancy rates computed for the period subsequent to registration were designed to

indicate the fertility which could be expected in a population which presumably at the time of instruction desired to reduce unplanned pregnancies to nil. All pregnancies were therefore counted which occurred one or more months following registration except when there was a specific item in the nurse's notes that the pregnancy was planned. In the computation of the person years exposure to pregnancy, the first month following registration was omitted to avoid uncertainty over pre-existing pregnancies. Nine months for each pregnancy, planned or unplanned, and resulting in a full-term delivery was deducted as well as three months for each abortion. Thus intervals during which omissions or irregular use of the contraceptive method here reported remained in the denominator of the pregnancy rate, and when there was a pregnancy it was included in the numerator. This may seem to some critical readers to bias estimates of efficacy of familyplanning projects. However, we believe

that this procedure is the only valid basis for determining pregnancy rates which a program director may expect for those mothers who register with a service of the type described earlier in this paper.
The post-registration experience covered a total of 234 couple-years of exposure to contraception. During this time 98 pregnancies occurred of which 13 were planned. In Table 3, age-specific unplanned pregnancy rates are shown, based upon postregistration experience. These indices appear in column 6, (Method I) and vary from a ratio of 50 pregnancies per 100 persons years of exposure for women under 20 years of age to 16 for women 35 years and older.*
The efficacy of the project may be evaluated by (1) determining age-specific unplanned pregnancy rates following registration (R»), (2) comparing these indices with rates which were noted among women
* During the 234 elapsed couple-years there were 55 years in which contraception was not used. Reasons such as non-cooperation of the husband, exhaustion of supplies, pregnancy or lack of interest were given. From one point of view each pregnancy occurring during such times constitutes a failure of the method and of the project. It is, however, of interest to calculate the pregnancy rate for periods in which systematic use of a contraceptive method was reported. These are given in column 9, and will be useful for comparison with reports of other projects in which this form of calculation is frequently employed.

which expresses the percentage reduction in fertility attributable to the family-planning service. Estimates of efficacy using this method are given in Table 4. For all age groups, except 35 years of age and over, the unplanned pregnancy rate is between 40 to 50 per cent of the level of fertility noted prior to registration. The efficacy ratio reaches a maximum of 75 per cent in the oldest age levels. (It should be understood that the corresponding reduction in birth rates will be somewhat less than that stated in connection with pregnancy rates.)
An unplanned pregnancy among women registered in a fertility-control service must be regarded as a failure of the program. The field staff were instructed to query carefully the mother involved to determine, if possible, the reasons for contraceptive failure in connection with the 85 unplanned pregnancies. Fifteen of these were attributed by respondents to failure of method. Of the remaining 70 failures, 20, or 29 per cent, were attributed to non-cooperation of the husband, 21, or 30 per cent, occurred as a result of occasional failure to use the available method, 7, or 10

per cent, were due to failure to use contraception because of fear of pain, and 6 or 9 per cent were ascribed to incorrect use of the method. No useful information could be secured on the cause of the remaining 16 failures.
Efficacy of Individual Methods
In order to determine validly whether the separate methods differed in effectiveness, a therapeutic trial would have been necessary. Briefly stated, this would have required a random distribution of methods among the registrants and considerable rigidity so far as permission to change methods was concerned. Because freedom of choice wasconsidered necessary to secure maximum cooperation, a test of this type was not attempted. In an analysis of unplanned pregnancy rates by method, the condom, suppository and foam tablet appeared to be of the same general order of effectiveness while the diaphragm and jelly, and jelly-alone techniques produced pregnancy rates 20 per cent above those recorded for the first group of three methods. Since a satisfactory design for comparative analysis was lacking, and the total experience was limited, these impressions should be regarded as merely suggestive of what may be expected with rural type populations.

tility control is not known at the present time. Motivation, religion, the availability of supplies are several of the more important factors which determine whether or not the principle of fertility control will be accepted as well as the method to be used. In a rural situation in Puerto Rico, it would appear that the condom is the most acceptable of the presently available techniques.
An unplanned pregnancy constitutes a failure of any plan for birth control. The failure may be due to deficiencies in the materials used. It may be due to improper use of the method. It may come about as a result of irregular use of the method, instances of omission being ascribed to pain, lack of cooperation from husband, etc Based on 2,804 months of recorded experience, the unplanned pregnancy rate was found to be 42 pregnancies per 100 couples per year, a drop of 49 per cent from the rate which presumably would have been obtained in the absence of the use of contraceptive methods. Half of the failures were attributed to husband noncooperation and to irregular use of available methods. This would seem to suggest that the clinic and home visiting program should provide some means for enlisting the husband's interest and cooperation toward a satisfactory plan for birth control.

Interpretation and Summary

A program of birth control in a rural

A universally acceptable means for fer- population must provide a convenient

161

means of bringing basic knowledge and necessary supplies to the patient in her home. Restriction of these services to the limits of a clinic setting results in failures attributable to patient difficulties in transportation, and does not provide the encouragement and support which many isolated families require to effectively and

consistently use the selected method of contraception.
Acknowledgement is made of the counsel in study design received from Mr. Jose Janer, Director, Bureau of Statistics of the Puerto Rican Department of Health. The vigorous efforts of Dr. Edris Rice-Wray, formerly medical consultant to the Asociacion Puertorriquena pro Bienester de la Familia, were most helpful in assuring a consistent control effort under difficult conditions.
