The general object of the paper is to assess, on the basis of the primary data collected from certain selected districts of Uttar Pradesh, the extent to which the social and occupational factors affect fertility. In organizing the survey, which was conducted in 1956, a stratified random sample was so framed as to select two districts from each of the three geographical zones of the state. These districts were further subdivided into tehsils--a subdivision of the district. From each "tehsil" a compact block of villages (or a single village) comprising a minimum of 1,000 households was selected, and from each block every fifth household in the household schedule was selected up to a maximum of 150. Thus on a 20% selection basis from a minimum universe of 6,000 households, 1,050 were selected for intensive study. Of these households 32 had to be deleted, as the members of these households declined to furnish any information regarding fertility and marriage, or they consisted of broken families. Consequently, the sample was reduced to 1,018 households, which at the time of survey had 1,413 couples.
* This paper presents the summary results of the chapters on fertility of the Ph.D. dissertation entitled "Differential Fertility and Mortality in Different Castes and Communities in the Rural Uttar Pradesh, India," submitted to the Department of Economics, Lucknow University, in 1959. The author is indebted to Prof. Charles F. Westoff, Assistant Director, Office of Population Research, Princeton University, for his valuable suggestions and corrections.

Special care was taken at the time of survey to collect reliable and! accurate data, and for that certain measures were adopted. The complete survey was conducted separately by two investigators: all the husbands were contacted by the writer himself and all the wives, by a trained female investigator. Relevant particulars in connection with identification, age, maternity record, and marital history were obtained from both the husbands and wives. Wherever the information supplied by these differed, the couples were revisited. This matching of the data case by case considerably reduced the margin of error. The accuracy, especially of the age data, was further insured by consulting documentary evidence,1 where available, for age at marriage and present age. Of 1,413 couples, 77 cases had to be rejected because the information they supplied was either vague, faulty, or incomplete and could not be corrected for one reason or another.
As in Hindu society the caste system provides a rigid social framework where the place of a person in the social hier-
1 In many of the rural households in Uttar Pradesh, a record is maintained of the gifts presented to the bride and groom at the time of marriage. This record also contains such information as the age at marriage, date of marriage, and the names of bride and groom. The ages calculated on the basis of these records are more reliable than those based on mere statements.

archy is exclusively determined by his birth, and change to another level is impossible, most of the castes tend to show a distinctive pattern of social institutions, mores and values. In a society where the cultural and institutional factors play an important role in determining the family-building habits, a study of fertility by castes is not only interesting but also revealing.
A total of 32 castes was covered by the investigation. All of these castes have been grouped into three main categories2 which are neither racially pure nor religiously distinct from each other, but, on the other hand, represent those broad and conventionally accepted social groups within which one expects to find a certain homogeneity in economic conditions and social environment. Fertility differentials are analyzed in these groups rather than in individual castes for the simple reason that the number of cases in many of the castes are statistically too small to yield valid results.
According to this classification, 286 couples were identified as belonging to upper castes--Brahmin, Jat, Kayastha, Rajput, and Vaish; 485 couples, in the intermediate castes consisting mostly of the functional and the artisan class-- Ahir, Barahi, Kumhar, Lohar, Nai, Sonar, and Teli--and the other backward castes such as Kahar, Kurmi, Lodh and Murao. The remaining 565 couples of the low castes were substantially represented by the Bhangis, Chamars, Dhanuks, Dhobis, Doms, and Pasis.
Table 1 gives the age composition of the wives under study.
2 The caste categories have been based on the social distance scale given by Mukerjee and colleagues in Inter-Caste Tensions, Monograph No. 1, J. K. Institute of Sociology and Human Relations, Lucknow University, India (Mimeographed), 1956, p. 4.

CHILDESSNESS, STERILITY, AND
SUBFECUNDITY
Not all wives had borne children. About 19% of the total wives have had no pregnancy. All of these wives, however, cannot be classified as sterile since most of them married recently. Still, there were many who had been married for several years and had no child. By ordinary standards, these wives may be assumed sterile because in rural areas hardly any couple desires to remain childless. Though the prevalence of sterility is difficult to measure except by clinical examination, a field study can give some clues. Defining all wives married for 15 years or more with no pregnancy, as sterile, the extent of complete sterility can best be seen by considering these as a percentage of the total with a marriage duration of at least 15 years. According to this evaluation the extent of complete sterility works out to be about 5%.
Even leaving aside the childless and sterile, not all the wives could realize their full reproductive capacity. The failure of the wives to conceive throughout their reproductive span, especially when they are unfamiliar with the meth-

ods of family planning,3 measures the degree of subfecundity. Table 2 gives the proportion of mothers never conceived after a particular age with completed maternity experience according to their age at the birth of the last child.

AGE-SPECIFIC AND TOTAL FERTILITY
Data relating to age-specific and total fertility are given in Table 3.
The number of children born is quite high. The average woman gave birth to more than seven children by the end of her reproductive age. These rates are based on married females, which also include about 19% of wives who are childless; and if these are excluded, the total fertility per mother would be considerably above seven children. The mean age of the sample wife averages 30.5 years. By that age the total number of live births per female comes to 4.5, while up to the age of 30 to 34 years a female has completed more than three-
3 At the time of survey questions were also asked about the practice of family planning, and none of the couples reported practicing any of the methods of birth control including coitus interruptus and abortion. Abstinence ranging from 4 to 7 months after delivery and avoidance of certain other days were common, but these practices are deep rooted in the various religious and traditional values and as such have little to do with the actual family limitation practices. See G. B. Saxena, Latent Practices of Family Planning and Motivations: A Sample Study in Rural Uttar Pradesh, Family Planning News, 3 (3): 57-58, March 1962.

fourths of her total fertility, and up to the age of 35 to 39, about nine-tenths.
An examination of the age-specific fertility rates shows that fertility increases until it reaches the peak at 1.8 children during ages 25 to 29, after which it declines; but even in the next age group, 30 to 34, it is near the peak level. In subsequent age-groups fertility decreases slowly. Thus, fertility rises sharply, reaches the peak in the late twenties, remains near the peak level for some years, and then declines slowly. The decline becomes sharp only after the mid-maternal age of 39. It is this early rise and failure of fertility to decline sharply that accounts for the higher total fertility of females in this population.
DIFFERENTIAL FERTILITY AND
CASTE GROUPS
Table 4 presents the age-specific and cumulative fertility rates in different caste groups. A study of these rates indicates the following characteristics:
First, except in the maternal age group 35 to 39, age-specific fertility rates of the upper caste tend to be somewhat lower than that of the intermediate caste rates. Similarly, with the exception of the age groups 20 to 24, 35 to 39 and 40 to 44 the intermediate-caste rates are consistently below the lower-caste rates.
Secondly, the upper-caste women exhibit the highest fertility during age 20 to 24, while the intermediate and lowcaste women reach the peak some five years later during ages 25 to 29; after that their fertility rate declines, but gradually, so that even in the subsequent age groups their fertility rates are higher than those of the upper castes.
Lastly, the upper-caste woman up to the close of her reproductive period re-

 (a) Throughout this paper "fertility" refers to marital fertility, and the rates are based on the children ever born to females up to the time of enquiry. The age-specified fertility rate, 1.76, for all females, as given in column x, is obtained by dividing the total children born during the age 20 to 24 by the females above 24 who were married by that age.
(b) In columns iii-ix the rates in different cells are obtained by dividing the total number of births in each cell by the number of females given in the last row of the table in the corresponding column. For example 0.04 (first row, col i>) is obtained by dividing the total births in this cell by 242.
(c) The rates in the bottom diagonal cells representing incomplete exposures have been omitted.

ports even lesser number of births, 7.3, which a woman of the intermediate or low caste has when she is in the age group 35 to 39years.
Our data thus show a slight association between fertility and caste hierarchy. The total fertility of upper-caste women

is lower than that of the low- and intermediate-caste women, not only because, in most age groups, they comparatively bear a smaller number of children, but also because they begin to register a decline in fertility at an earlier age.

the assessment of which is outside the scope of the present study, it may also be said that there are some traditional and cultural factors also which seem to underlie the inverse relation between caste and fertility. For example, the husbands of the upper castes generally avoid cohabitation on festivals and fast days. Many of the orthodox upper-caste Hindus also observe New-Moon, FullMoon and "Ekadashi," the eleventh day after Full-Moon or New-Moon, as auspicious and inauspicious, respectively, to cohabit. Together with these are a variety of other days also on which the upper-caste people observe abstinence. The investigator, however, could not come across any low-caste man who may be following any of these taboos.
The other factor that also seems to affect fertility is the long period of abstinence during lactation in the upper caste. Invariably in all the upper castes and in some of the intermediate castes also, the period of abstinence varies from 4 to 7 months and in some cases up to 8 months also. Against this in low caste the maximum period of abstinence is 4 months.
Due to the paucity of data it has not been possible to analyze fertility differentials by economic conditions, but it is important to mention that in the higher

castes economic conditions are much better than in the lower castes, and it is difficult to answer whether the higher fertility in the lower caste can be ascribed to their poor living conditions.
DIFFERENTIAL SIZE OF FAMILY IN
RELATION TO THE AGE OF THE WIFE
The relation between different caste groups and size of family is shown in Table 5.
The data reveal that castes at the higher rungs of the social ladder have comparatively smaller families. Among women 45 years old and over, the average number of births varies from 7.6 in the upper castes to 8.8 in low castes. In other words, the average completed family of the intermediate and low castes is larger by approximately 17% and 27% respectively, than of the upper caste, while the difference between families of the intermediate and low castes is only about 8%. This indicates clearly that the intermediate castes are nearer to low castes than to upper castes in childbearing.
It may also be noted that maternity begins somewhat late in the case of upper and intermediate-caste women. Among 35 women under 15 years of age in the upper and intermediate castes, none has reported a birth, whereas in the

low caste 2 women in this age group have reported one birth each. The later age o maternity in the highest two caste groups can be associated with older age at marriage.
Even within the same occupation the relation between caste and fertility remains unchanged. Table 6 illustratesthe size of family in relation to the ageof the wives whose husbands have reported agriculture as their main occupation.4

DISTRIBUTION OF COUPLES BY
NUMBER OF CHILDREN EVER BORN
We have estimated theaverage size of family, but this tells us nothing about the distribution of family size. These figures are given in Table 7. The contrast between the rates of the different columns is striking. The intermediate and low-caste families are well spread out over different family sizes. The most heavily represented families in the upper castes are of 7 and 8 children, while in the intermediate and lowcastes theseare the families with 10+ children.
4 Fertility differentials by caste have been analyzed in the agriculture class as this is the only class that adequately represents the various caste groups numerically.

 As the number of cases of wives with completed maternity, i.e., aged 45 and above, is not adequately large, wives aged 40 and above have beenconsidered.

If we classify all families into four groups according tosize such as (1) small with 3 andless than 3 children, (2) medium-sized families with 4 to 6 children, (3) large-sized families with 7 to 9 children, and lastly (4) families of very large size consisting of 10 and more than 10 children, the above rates show that whereas small sized families are heavily represented in theupper caste, these are the least in thelow caste. About 9% of the total families in the upper caste, 8% in theintermediate caste, and5% in the low caste are of 3and less than 3children. At the other end of the scale the proportion of the very large-sized families is reduced from 33% in the lowcaste to 27% in the intermediate caste and 16% in the upper caste.

difference between the average size of family of the upper and low castes is significant at the 1% level. The difference between the upper and the intermediate caste is significant at 5%but not at the 1% level. Hence it is difficult to ascertain whether this difference is real or owing to sampling fluctuation. The difference between the intermediate and low caste is not statistically significant.

GROSS REPRODUCTION RATE
Table 8 gives data on gross reproduction. The rate shows that under present fertility conditions every 100 mothers passing through the entire reproductive period would be replaced by 375 future mothers. This replacement will operate under two impossible assumptions: firstly, that all the present mothers would survive to the end of the reproductive period; and secondly, that all the newly born girls would survive until they reach their age of motherhood.
The low and intermediate castes have not only higher fertility rates than the upper castes but also higher reproductive rates, although mortality will reduce the number of survivors that attain the childbearing ages, and widows and spinsters will further affect the number joining the cohort of mothers in the next generation.

All the husbands have been divided into four main occupational classes that

are distinctly separate: (1) the agriculturists, who include owner cultivators as well as tenant cultivators; (2) laborers who are mostly landless workers, working on the holdings of medium- and large-scale farmers; (3)artisans and petty businessmen; and (4) the service class, consisting largely of village officials, government servants, and schoolteachers.
The results of differential fertility by occupation are given in Table 9. The highest fertility is exhibited by the wives of the laborers and agriculturists; the lowest, by the wives whose husbands are employed in the service class. Between these twolies the fertility of businessmen and artisans. The total fertility of a service-class wife is lower than that of a wife of a laborer, agriculturist, or artisan. The wives of the businessmen and artisans, who display higher fertility than the service-class wives, are surpassed by the wives of the agriculturists and laborers. At the same time they reach peak at a lower level than those of the agriculture class. In short, it is the low peak level and lower reproductive performance at various ages that explain the lower total fertility in the service and artisan classes.
DIFFERENTIAL SIZE OF FAMILY IN
RELATION TO AGE OF THE WIFE
BY OCCUPATION
The relation between different occupational classes andsize of family according to age of the wife is given in Table 10, which reveals that, aside from certain younger age groups, size of family increases as we move from service class to labor class through artisans and agriculturists. The completed family of a service-class wife is 86%, 81% and 78%, respectively, of the business, agriculture, and labor class, while that of the business-class wife is only 94% and 91% of

So far we have tried to measure the differentials in fertility after keeping constant a few of the more important variables, i.e., age, sex, and marital status, and we have noted that fertility drops as one moves from service to labor class. As there is a close association between caste and occupational class, these fertility differentials cannot be totally ascribed to occupational differ-

ences, so only after keeping the caste variable constant can we isolate the effect of occupational differences in fertility. Of course, other variables also affect fertility, but in the absence of any information about their distribution they have been ignored.
In Table 11 the class differentials in family size have been analyzed in the intermediate caste since it is well spread over different occupational groups. Further, due to the small number of cases the differentials have been analyzed in broad age categories.
These rates show that within the same

caste the class composition of fertility is totally changed. Such a pattern of fertility clearly contradicts the supposition that occupation, like caste, is an important determinant of fertility.
SUMMARY
From the preceding analysis, it is clear that the average number of children born to a female throughout her reproductive period is quite high. It is the early rise and the failure of fertility to decline sharply that accounts for the higher number of births. The data also

reveal an inverse relation between caste and fertility. This relation holds up when the caste differentials in fertility are analysed in the same occupation. These differentials seem to be the results of the diverse cultural traditions, taboos, and social values.
Occupation does not seem to affect the family-building pattern of the people, possibly because it is less associated than is caste with the cultural patterns affecting fertility such as differential abstinence periods and different degrees of taboos on sexual behaviour.
