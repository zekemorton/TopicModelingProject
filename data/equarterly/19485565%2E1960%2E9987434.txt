FERTILITY DIFFERENTIALS AMONG ECONOMIC STRATA IN CENTRAL INDIA

X HE PATTERN OF POPULATION GROWTH
in India will have a decisive bearing on whether the several economic and social objectives set forth in the Five-Year Plans are achieved. Over the past halfcentury a high mortality rate has operated to counterbalance a high and stable fertility rate, thus preventing a rapid increase in population size. In the future, however, the past influence of mortality will be lessened considerably. Deaths due to malnutrition, famines, and gastrointestinal ailments are being decreased through improved agricultural production and distribution and the purification of water supplies. In addition, the Government of India and the World Health Organization have launched national programs of medical care and preventive medicine which, on the basis of recent surveys, appear effective in lowering the incidence of smallpox, cholera, plague, malaria, filariasis, tuberculosis, and venereal diseases. Control over these primary causes of death implies a rapid drop in the mortality rate and, on the basis of evidence gathered during the filariasis campaign, a decrease in the incidence of sterility in the population.
The potential effect of declining mortality on population growth and economic development in India is vividly described by Coale and Hoover.1 Their

estimates, which assume an increase in the average expectation of life at birth from 32 years in 1951 to 52 years in 1986, show a population of 775 millions by 1986 if no change occurs in the current fertility rate. But, if it is assumed that a 50 per cent reduction in fertility occurs in linear fashion between 19561981 or between 1966-1981, then the figures would be 589 and 634 millions, respectively.2 The gain in per capita income, 1986 over 1956, would be 38 per cent if fertility did not decline, and 95 per cent, the goal of India, if the decline began in 1956.3
In this context, the future course of fertility has great importance. In the opinion of many demographers, a significant decline requires quick acceptance by the public of the birth control programs which have been introduced by the Government of India and voluntary associations. In the absence of deliberate controls, they argue, change should not be expected since the rate of fertility has remained constant over the past fifty years. One factor which might invalidate this argument is the fact that India's social structure which was relatively static during this period is not expected to remain so. It is therefore possible, but improbable in the short-run, that fertility patterns will be altered by

the numerous changes in social structure and social norms produced by the FiveYear Plans and new governmental policies.
These include, among others, modifications in the proportions of persons who are educated, living in urban areas, owning land, and employed in various occupations. According to the Planning Commission, the "Second Plan will . . . begin for the first time in fifty years, barring the two war periods, to increase the proportion of persons employed outside of agriculture and it will lay the foundation in industry and elsewhere which will expand employment over the future."4 The present 70:30 ratio of agricultural to non-agricultural employment will probably be reduced to 60:40 by 1975-1976.5 The occupations whose representation in the total labor force is expected to increase most include: semiskilled and skilled workers; engineers, doctors and nurses; rural extension workers; and managerial and administrative personnel.6 An illustration of the possible extent of their increase is provided by the Second Five-Year Plan, which runs from 1956 to 1961: one goal is 750,000 new semi-skilled and skilled industrial workers by 1961, which number is almost equal to the total (825,000) workers of this kind found in India in 1956.7 As indicated previously income levels are also expected to change, providing a reduction in the proportion of persons now found in the low income groups. The proportions of the popula-

tion who are landless and who have large holdings may be reduced by various land reform measures.
GENERAL PURPOSE
The general purpose of this paper is to determine whether there is any basis for assuming a change in fertility rates as a consequence of changes in the proportions of persons found in various occupational, income, and landownership groups. Such an assumption would seem reasonable if it is found that past and present fertility rates in India are associated with social status. Previous Studies. When previous studies of economic status and fertility are juxtaposed, one obtains an unclear picture of the relation between these two variables. The United Nations--Government of India Survey of Mysore, using type of dwelling as an index of the economic status of the family, found a positive association between completed fertility (that of women 45 years of age or over) and upper status. Rural women living in huts had 4.4 live births, whereas those living in "mudhouses with thatched roof" had 4.5 live births and those living in still better houses had 5.0 live births.8 Similarly, the wives of agricultural laborers had 4.0 live births, while those of small cultivators had 4.7 live births and those of large cultivators had 5.1 live births.9 Sample surveys of Kolhapur City and Poona District by the Gokhale Institute found, when age of the woman is controlled, that high fertility is associated with both higher grade occupations and large income.10

However, surveys by the Institute of three neighboring districts found birth rates to be independent of both occupation and income.11
A study of rural women in the Punjab, who had been married at least ten years, also shows virtually no difference in fertility among occupational and income groups.12 On the other hand, Kingsley Davis, using partial census data, found variations in the ratios of children 0-6 years of age to women 1443 years of age among occupational strata. Fertility was higher in the households of artisans and agriculturalists than in those of traders and professionals. But the differences, which were small, almost disappear when widows and spinsters are excluded in computing the ratios.13 A major deficiency of this study, due to the manner in which census data were published, was the grouping of castes on the basis of the vocation followed by a majority of their members in order to form the above-mentioned occupational groups.
The relation of land ownership to fertility is treated in a report of the National Sample Survey, Government of India. Among women married at least twelve years, the wives of the largest landowners have the highest fertility. Rut the differences between the groups are small, and the relationship of landownership to fertility is not linear.14

tion and income may be interpreted in different ways. It could be attributed, on the one hand, to genuine sectional or regional variations in the relationship, and, on the other hand, to differences in measuring fertility and economic classes.
Objectives and Sources of Data. This paper indicates the average number of children ever born (fertility) to women in central India, classified according to the occupation, income, and landownership of their husbands, and the extent to which their fertility averages are affected by the presence of widows and remarried. Secondly, attention is given to the relation between the fertility averages for unbroken, first marriages in these groups and the age of the female at marriage, the kind of family in which she lives (joint or nuclear), and place of residence.
The averages and percentages presented in this paper are based on careful control of differences among the economic subgroups in duration of marriage. After the women of each subgroup were classified according to the decade in which their marriages occurred, measures were computed for each decade, then cumulated and divided by the number of decades. This procedure is illustrated by Table 1.
Data for this study were obtained through a survey conducted by the author during January-May, 1958 in Nagpur District, which is now politically a part of Bombay State but geographically situated in central India. The sample consists of one per cent of the heads of households in the rural area and in each

viewers, using a schedule, to gather in-

data on 1429 and 1489 marriages, re-

the urban households there was a polyg-

Therefore, a sample of 1½ per cent of the households was initially drawn with the intent of interviewing until satisfactory data were obtained from one per' cent of them. Lack of cooperation on the part of husbands and wives was later found to be a minor problem. The major difficulty of locating certain families was due either to the absence of a number or a double number (municipal and census) for several dwellings.

FINDINGS
Occupation and Fertility. Among occupational groups, there is very little difference in fertility.16 By column 13 of Table 2 we find that artisans, clerks, professionals, and agriculturalists (owners and tenants) have identical averages of 4.8 children. Each of the other two groups--traders and laborers (agricultural and non-agricultural)--have 4.6 children. Other sections of Table 2 indicate the insignificance of widowhood and remarriage as factors affecting general fertility rates among occupations. Although agriculturalists and professionals are identical in fertility, widows constitute 4.3 per cent and remarried 4.1 per cent of the former group but only 1.6 per cent and 0.8 per cent, respectively, of the latter group (columns 7 and 8). Another procedure for measuring the effect of widowhood and remarriage is to compare column 10, which excludes them, with column 13 which includes
16One of the major obstructions to accurate measurement of fertility in India is the inability of some women, especially elder ones, to recall their exact number of deliveries. Since the nature and extent of recall lapse is presently unknown, it is impossible to estimate its effect on the fertility averages presented in this paper. For a discussion of this topic, see: Mahalanobis and DasGupta, "The Use of Sample Surveys in Demographic Studies in India," paper presented at the World Population Conference, 1954.

It is also evident from Table 3 that fertility is not related to either the age of the female at marriage, whether she lives in a nuclear or joint family, or resides in an urban or village community. Comparing again agriculturalists and

tility and economic status, when measured by the number of acres of land owned, is indicated in Table 6. Large landowners, or those having 20 or more acres, have the highest fertility, 4.9 children on the average, and the small landowners have the lowest, 4.6. But the fertility of both the landless and medium landowners, those having 10-19 acres, exceed that of small landowners. Widowhood and remarriage, as in the case of occupational and income groups, bear little relation to the general fertility of landownership groups. Small and large landowners are most differentiated in fertility, yet 3.6 per cent of the women in each group are widowed, and 3.1 per cent of those in the former and 3.3 per cent of those in the latter are remarried. It is further evident from a comparison of column 10 with column 13 that the inclusion or exclusion of widowed and remarried women in computing fertility averages makes little difference.
Again, one observes by Table 7 a lack of correlation between the reproductive patterns of economic strata and similarities or differences among them in average age at marriage, joint family living, and urban or rural residence. The landless, who have neither a large nor small number of children, have the high-

est mean age at marriage, the lowest per cent living in a joint family structure, and the highest per cent of urban dwellers.
Birth Control Techniques and Fertility. It is, of course, possible that the fertility averages for our occupational, income, and landownership groups stem from other factors which affect the frequency of their exposure to the risks of pregnancy. Among these are: ignorance of the physiology of reproduction; sterility in either mate; physical incapacitation due to frequent or prolonged illness; physical separation due to the employment situation; the practice of returning to the mother's home for child delivery and postnatal care; or the use of contraceptives and other birth control devices.
The effect of one of these factors may be briefly considered. During the survey, each couple was asked to give information on any birth control techniques which they knew, had used, and the frequency of such use. It is evident from their responses (Table 8) and our data in Table 9 that the low fertility of particular economic groups cannot be attributed to their use of birth control devices. Less than half of the urban couples and only a quarter of the rural ones knew any method--deliberate abstinence, contraceptives, abortion, sterili-

zation--of limiting family size, and only

3.8 per cent of the rural and only 7.3 per

cent of the urban couples had employed

a technique at any time during their

marital life. Of equal significance is the

relatively high fertility among couples

who had attempted to limit their family

size. As Table 9 shows, their mean fer-

tility is 5.1 whereas that of non-users of

any technique isonly 4.6. This rather

unusual situation probably stems from

the fact that deliberate controls are not

employed until the couple has hadan

excessive number of children.

Summary. Our data for central India

permit the following general conclusions

concerning the relation of fertility to

economic status. There is little varia-

tion in, and in most cases identical, fer-

tility averages among occupational

groups. Although fertility is high in the

medium income category and in the

Sw >^

large landownership group, neither income nor landownership bears a linear

relationship to fertility. Differences and

similarities among the economic strata

in reproductive behavior are not asso-

ciated with widowhood, remarriage, age

of the female atmarriage, family struc-

ture, or place of residence. Further, de-

liberate controls are seldom employed to

limit family size, and when they are,it

appears to occur after a couple has had

a large number of children.

Earlier, we noted that the Five-Year

Plans and legislation in India are ex-

pected to increase the per cent ofper-

sons employed in skilled (artisans),

clerical and professional occupations;

present in the middle-income groups;

and owning land. In view ofour find-

ings, there is no basis for assuming that

changes in the structure ofoccupations

and landownership will, in themselves,

alter fertility rates. On the other hand,

the expected change in income distribu-
