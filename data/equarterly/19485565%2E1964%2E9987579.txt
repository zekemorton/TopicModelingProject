MARRIAGE, PARENTHOOD, AND PREVENTION OF PREGNANCY FOR THE MENTALLY DEFICIENT*

Physicians, psychologists, clergymen, and marriage counselors are sometimes faced with these difficult questions: Should a young retarded man or woman marry? If he or she seemed able to undertake the responsibilities of marriage, would parenthood be advisable? Should they be protected from the physical and emotional stress of rearing children? If parenthood is contraindicated, what procedure should be advised--segregation, constant supervision, contraceptives, or voluntary sterilization?
There have been few studies on the quality of the child-rearing practices of the retarded or their ability to prevent unwanted pregnancy. In the literature on mental deficiency, there has been little reference to temporary methods of birth control or to voluntary sterilization. The latter omission is due, perhaps, to the fact that the retarded individual was considered unable to understand the operation and its meaning, and, therefore, was unable to give a valid consent. However, the experience in Sweden (Weintraub, 1951) has demonstrated that the retardates who are able to live in the community can understand the operation, and often request it. The Human Betterment Association of America, whose program is devoted to

research, education, and service in the field of voluntary sterilization, has had a similar experience.
The purpose of this paper is to investigate the advisability of marriage and parenthood for the retardate as well as the means of preventing inadvisable pregnancies in the light of the greater public acceptance of surgical birth control.
SEGREGATION AND SUPERVISION
Segregation was used widely in the early part of this century for the sole purpose of preventing reproduction. Young women were sent to institutions established especially for females of child-bearing age. When their reproductive years were over, they were released to the community. The exact proportion of young retardates now in institutions for this purpose is not known but it is much less than formerly (Begab, 1958; Goldstein, 1959).
Since World War II there has developed a greater awareness of the ability of the retarded individual to hold a job and support himself and in some cases a family as well (Charles, 1953; Dinger, 1958; Engel, 1952; Ferguson & Kerr, 1955; Kennedy, 1948; Shaw & Wright, 1960; Thorne & Dolan, 1953; Wolfson, 1956).
Along with the greater awareness of the retardate's ability to assume a useful--though sometimes humble--role in the community has come a greater understanding of his need to live as normal

and as full a life as possible. Constant supervision may limit his social relationships to a frustrating degree. Parents often find constant supervision an intolerable burden. The resulting frustration and resentment may be reflected in their attitudes toward the child, who may experience these attitudes as rejection. While sterilization will not eliminate the need for supervision, it will lessen the parents' anxiety regarding possible pregnancy, and this reduced anxiety will usually improve parent-child relationships.

the high-grade retardates, it must be remembered that marriage for the "weakminded" is prohibited in Iowa, Pennsylvania, and South Dakota, and is probably illegal in fifteen other states, namely, Delaware, Indiana, Kansas, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin (Strubing & Scully, 1960). The uncertainty is due to the interpretation which may be given to the different wording of the statutes in each state.

MARRIAGE FOR THE RETARDED
At present, there is a recognition of the normal sexual needs of the retarded individual and a realization that in some cases the retardate is capable of sustaining a reasonable, stable, and happy marriage. Marriage may often be beneficial to him (Hilliard, 1956, p. 839).
In Gosney and Popenoe's study (1946, p. 35), 59 per cent of marriages among the retarded were rated as happy, 31 per cent as unhappy. Shaw and Wright (1960) studied 168 families in which one or both of the parents were retarded. In a subsample of 90 families with one retarded parent and no children, or only one child, they found that 64 per cent of the marriages were reasonably stable and successful; 20 per cent of the families where both of the parents were retarded were reported successful.
Goodenough expressed the opinion of many authorities in the field when she wrote: "Marriage at an early age between sterilized subnormal cases is desirable and should be encouraged. In this way they are permitted many of the satisfactions of normal life without assuming more of the responsibilities than they are able to handle" (1956, p. 266).
Before recommending marriage for

LIMITATION OF OFFSPRING
As a result of greater freedom in social contacts, it may be assumed that more marriages will take place among the retarded in those states where it is not illegal. Hathaway (1947) asserted it was our social responsibility to provide guidance and instruction in family planning to all defective families; family planning should be considered teachable and a privilege--not a penalty--since even defective couples will not choose to burden themselves with offspring beyond their potential to support. Halperin wrote "Besides the possibility of transmitting their defect to potential children on medical and humanitarian grounds it is unjust not to discourage the mental defectives from having offspring" (1946, p. 162).
Masland, Sarason, and Gladwin wrote: ". . . there were many cases where the limitation of reproduction is desirable. However, the decision regarding each limitation requires the evaluation of many factors" (1958, p. 16).
This protection assumes that the individual is fertile. The estimates of the number of offspring for the retarded vary with the samples from the low of 1.2 children per female (Tietze & John-

son, 1950, p. 551), to 6.6 (Priest, Thuline, LaVeck, & Jarvis, 1961, p. 45). Halperin (1946) found the number of children decreased from 5.05 for the defectives to 4.12 for the inferior or dull. Shaw & Wright (1960) found the birth rate for retarded families to be 50 per cent greater than the average, but this was offset by a higher death rate. Dinger (1958), Kennedy (1948, p. 27), and Wunsch (1950, p. 309) reported the birth rate of the retarded similar to that of the normal population of the same socioeconomic level. Kennedy (op. cit.) found the average number of children per married female was 3.8, but only a small proportion were married; she reported a higher frequency of barrenness among both males and females. Book (1959, p. 114) found the fertility rate in Sweden to be very low or nonexistent for those with well-defined types of mental retardation, such as Friedreich's ataxia; among the severely retarded in three counties he found an average of 4.6 for married women and .15 for unmarried. Book also found a decrease of fertility with more severe retardation.
Before recommending any contraceptive measure it would be possible to administer a fertility test, but this would not necessarily indicate that the infertility would continue throughout the child-bearing period so the test would have to be repeated at frequent intervals.
There is little in the literature regarding the degree of success with which the mental defective can practice temporary methods of birth control. Prichard (1949, p. 543) wrote that contraception would not be adequately carried out by most retarded individuals. Penrose (1934, p. 167) wrote: "Provision might be made for the education of mental defective persons in methods of birth control. One cannot, however, expect

persons of subnormal mentality to be able to carry out methods of birth control." Penrose (1932, p. 191) qualified this statement by adding in another reference that contraception was impractical by methods then known. This was written before the development of the oral contraceptive. There is no evidence of tests having been made to determine whether the retarded individual could use this method reliably.
Abel &Kinder (1942, p. 177) stated the subnormal adolescent girl would not be able to use birth control techniques with any degree of reliability because she is not likely to understand the method and the necessity for using it since she is unable to look ahead and foresee consequences. Goodenough concludes from her long experience with the retarded: ". . . The consistent use of contraceptives is too much to expect from those of subnormal minds" (1956, p. 265). Mickelson (1949, p. 520) found evidence that approximately eight per cent were able to use birth control methods with fair success, but that sterilization had made a greater contribution to their welfare.
Surgical birth control, which has been proven acceptable to many who are unwilling or unable to use temporary methods of contraception, would appear to be the most suitable method for mentally deficient persons. Sterilization is produced by means of the surgical procedure called salpingectomy for the female and vasectomy for the male. The operation closes a bristle-sized tube but removes no gland and has no physical effect other than preventing the meeting of the sperm and the ovum. Sterilization is being requested with increasing frequency by the general population (D'Esopo, 1950; Chaset, 1962, p. 513). Greater acceptance is evidenced also by the resolution passed by the General

Board of the National Council of Churches of Christ in the United States in February 1961, and by the Anglican Church Assembly Board of Social Responsibility in England (News of popu~ lation and birth control, 1962, #104). Sterilization also has gained approval in India as being more practical than temporary methods of birth control (ibid., #101) and is the most popular method in Puerto Rico (Hill, Stycos and Back, 1959, p. 180). Sterilization also is preferred by many in the lower socioeconomic groups in this country (Berle, 1957, p. 275; Rainwater, 1960, p. 177). Tietze, for the National Committee of Maternal Health, estimated that in the ten years previous to 1955, there was an average of at least 100,000 persons operated on annually in this country for the sole purpose of preventing conception.1 This number does not include the operations which resulted in sterility but which were performed for reasons of medical necessity, such as the removal of a cancerous uterus.
Because of the growing realization that the retarded should lead a full and normal life; because of the concern that he should not be overburdened by children if he does not have the competency to rear them properly; and because of the greater acceptance of surgical birth control, the indications should be reevaluated on an individual voluntary basis.
INDICATIONS FOR STERILIZATION
Medical and Psychological
In any decision involving sterilization there may be medical, psychological, eugenic, and socioeconomic indications to

be considered. The amount of support provided by the family and by the community must also be considered.
Some of the medical contraindications for pregnancy for both the retarded and the nonretarded are listed in The Physician and Sterilization (Human Betterment). A partial list of these contraindications follow: repeated Caesarian sections, certain types of heart disease, severe hypertensive disease, previous vaginal plastic operations, serious varicosities, intractable diabetes, selected psychiatric disorders, malignancies of the uterus, severe epilepsy, Hodgkins disease, and multiparity (Greenhill, 1960, pp. 501-596). According to a recent study by Guttmacher (1957, p. 592) the indications for multiparity are 99 per cent socioeconomic and one per cent medical. A complete list of contraindications may not be compiled since each case must be (evaluated individually (Russell, 1962, p. 17).
In addition to the physical defects, emotional maladjustment may seriously impair the individual's adequate functioning as a parent. The emotional maturity of the retarded individual may correspond more closely to his mental age than his chronological age (Begab, 1958, p. 718). Therefore, the psychological stress of the responsibilities of parenthood, especially with many children, may disrupt the precarious adjustment of the retardate.
Pollock (1945, p. 478) found the rate of first admissions in the New York State hospitals to be seven times greater for the defective than for the nondefective population. The Illinois Commission for Handicapped Children estimated in 1949 that 35 per cent of the retarded were also maladjusted (1949, p. 13).
One factor contributing to their mal-
adjustment may be the cognizance of

100 Bass Eugen. Quart.

their inadequacy which leads to hopeless comparisons with others resulting in self-depreciation and the feeling of failure. This tension, added to the retarded individual's limited capacity, may overwhelm his resources and bring on depression. Penrose (1934, p. 191) observed that the added responsibility of a child often overburdened the capacity of the retarded individual, added to his feeling of inadequacy, and jeopardized his ability to live outside an institution.
The report of the 1956 Josiah Macy Conference on New Directions in Community Planning for Mentally Retarded Children quotes Dr. Bain of the U. S. Children's Bureau as saying that parents and workers sometimes pressure the retarded child into areas in which he can never experience anything but failure because they assume that what is desirable for the "normal" child is also desirable for the retarded. The wiser course would be to recognize that he is capable of useful work and subjective happiness when he is protected from stresses beyond his capacities (ibid., p. 49).
Few studies have been found concerning the stresses of parenthood as they relate to the emotional maladjustment of the retarded. Mickelson found 41 per cent of the feebleminded families had serious mental health problems (1947, p. 651). This rate was higher among the larger families. Sheridan wrote of the mentally retarded mothers: "They usually manage their households fairly well, but when the family responsibilities outgrow their capacity they become overwhelmed and completely unable to help themselves or to seek advice where it is available" (1956, p. 92). Kratter (1958, p. 271) agrees with this as do Shaw and Wright.

Eugenic Indications
The hereditary indications for preventing parenthood apply to many other handicaps as well as mental deficiency. Falls wrote the following in regard to hereditary eye problems: "Each of us has a moral biologic obligation to endow our offspring with the best possible physical and mental equipment. To do less, questions the right to parenthood. The public is awakening to this understanding" (1960, p. 142).
The emphasis on heredity as an important contributing factor in mental deficiency was strong during the first quarter of this century. Since then, the emphasis has shifted toward environment. The recent research in genetics and the finding that there is a genetic factor in some of the clinical syndromes such as Friedreich's ataxia, Schilder's disease, gargoylism, phenylpyruvia, amaurotic idiocy, the Lawrence-MoonBiedl syndrome, Von Recklinghausen's disease, and the Rh blood incompatibility has increased the interest in hereditary factors.
The estimates of the incidence of the hereditary factor vary from 90 per cent for Tredgold in 1905 to 1.7 per cent for Neuer in 1947; the average of the estimates made by 15 experts in the field was 51.3 per cent (Wallin, 1955, p. 421). According to Wallin, inheritance plays a significant role in the production of both the simple and the clinical types, but is more important in the higher grade undifferentiated type, the mechanism probably being different for the various types.
Both the extent of heredity and its mechanisms are far from being clear (Davies, 1959, p. 64). Sarason and Gladwin wrote: "At the present time practically all responsible workers in the field recognize that conclusive proof of the

hereditability of mental ability (where no organic or metabolic pathology is involved) is still lacking" (1958, p. 1152). Drs. French and Scott of the Devereux School wrote in their recent book, Child in the Shadows: "Although few people today believe that mental retardation is ever directly transmitted through heredity as a characteristic in itself in the same way that some physical features are, there is an element of heredity in some instances" (I960, p. 55).
It has been recognized that mental deficiency is not a dominant characteristic to be radically eliminated by segregation or sterilization. Gamble found only 15 per cent of his sample of 2,762 patients had one or two retarded par-

ents so that, had the retarded parents been sterilized, only 15 per cent of the cases might have been prevented (1952, p. 126). Nor can mental deficiency be classified as a simple recessive. However, the probability of a combination of recessive genes from both the mother and father must be considered since retarded individuals usually choose mates on a similar intelligence level. A tendency has been found for the retarded female to marry a man with a higher IQ, but this differential is small (Mickelson, 1947, p. 649; Shaw, 1960).
A considerable percentage of retarded children has been found in the studies of retarded parents. Some of these studies are presented in Table 1 adapted from

Brandon (1957, p. 713). Some of the variation is due to the use of different criteria for determining mental retardation and to the lack of a definition of the term prior to 1938 (ibid, p. 712). Comparisons of small samples of children of mentally deficient and normal parents do not provide reliable evidence of heredity unless there is adequate information concerning the diagnosis of the mother and the father as well as data on the environment and the learning experiences of the child (Carmichael, 1960, p. 685-686).
The more recent studies in Table 1 showing the highest percentage of retarded children were based on samples with varying degrees of mental deficiency (Roberts, 1947, p. 289); specified degree of subnormality reported by Higgins (1959); assortive matings, i.e. a defective mother with a defective father and with an "inferior" father or a normal father, by Halperin (op. cit.); or samples of parents with two or more defective children by Priest et al. and Wright, Tarjan & Eyer (1957).
In contrast to the earlier studies of parents of institutionalized children and follow-up studies of former special class pupils in Table 1, Wright et al. (1959) investigated families with two or more mentally defective siblings. They found 61 such families with 319 children. Of these children, 107 were known to be normal; 148, or 45 per cent, were defective and hospitalized; 28 were defective but with IQ unknown; and 28 were subnormal. Forty-seven of these families were diagnosed as familial; four had phenylpyruvia; two were mongoloid; two with prematurity and retrolental fibroplasia.
Priest et al. studied the total population of 1,800 of Rainier School in Washington. Familial cases with at least two full siblings in the school who were de-

fective were chosen. There were 83 families with a total of 443 siblings. Of these, 48 per cent were known to be retarded, seven per cent were questionably retarded, 25 per cent were normal, and 20 per cent were unknown (most of these had died young). In this sample, there were five families with both parents retarded and 66 per cent of the children were retarded. This corresponds with Halperin's subsample of assortive matings where both parents were retarded and 68 per cent of their children were defective.
Roberts (1947, p. 289) in a study of 3,400 retardates found an increasing number of mentally defective children with decreasing IQ's of the parents, as shown in Table 1. This agrees with Higgins' study of 1959.
Physical handicaps are twice as prevalent among the retarded (Wunsch, 1950, p. 309). Brandon (1960, p. 357) found 37 per cent of retarded had physical handicaps. Some of these handicaps may be hereditary. Therefore, in addition to the inheritance of the mental defect, the possibility of these other hereditary diseases should be considered: Huntington's chorea, the dominant type of hereditary chondrodystrophy, hemophelia, and cystic fibrosis of the pancreas. Ocular defects and deafness are prevalent among mental defectives. Studies have shown that 60 per cent of children with two blind parents are blind. With only one blind parent, 58.2 per cent are blind (Heck, p. 220). A Board of Education survey in England in 1950 revealed the cause of 68 per cent of the blindness among school children was congenital or hereditary (Roberts, 1961, p. 841). It has been estimated that approximately one third of deafness is hereditary. Heck writes in Education of Exceptional Children: "If deafness is to be reduced, it is

certain that measures for control of propagation are needed" (1953, p. 267).
THE RETARDATE'S ADEQUACY AS A PARENT
It is acknowledged that many parents of normal intelligence are inadequate parents. Intelligence is not the most important factor in determining the excellence of child-rearing practices; the number of pregnancies and emotional adjustment were found to be more highly correlated with satisfactoriness of child care (Mickelson, 1947). Persons concerned with juvenile delinquency have questioned the assumption that all persons are capable of rearing children properly. Menninger wrote: "It [planned parenthood] means, also, sufficient psychological maturity and understanding on the part of the parents to endure the dependency of a child for a period of many years. . . . Not all parents are capable of assuming the difficult and expensive responsibility of creating children . . . . It is a reduction ad absurdum to attempt to force this responsibility on people in the face of real obstacles" (1942, pp. 224-229).
A former secretary of the American Association of Marriage Counselors recently questioned the attitude of many counselors who assumed that parenthood is desirable for the "moderately dull, deficient, and disturbed" (Harper, 1959, pp. 8-9). He mentions some of the prerequisites, attitudes, and competencies needed for parenthood: a happy marriage, high motivation for parenthood, and a competency to deal with difficult situations under long term stress in a way which will assure the health and happiness for themselves and their children. According to Harper, many of us are afraid to face the realities of parenthood and go on believing the myth that

having children is a sure way to happiness.
There is a lack of satisfactory study of the social behavior and child-rearing practices of those with intellectual deficits, (Dinger, 1958; Kennedy, 1948, p. 7; Robinson &Pasewark, 1950, p. 601; Sarason, 1953, p. 148). Coakley reported: "I think we need to know much more about the ability of the mentally deficient to offer adequate care to children. We are having a number of unmarried mothers referred to us, some of them with IQ's in the forties. Another group we are concerned about is that of cases referred to us for service on a protective basis, children with one or both parents defective. Many of these situations border on neglect" (1956, pp. 10-11).
Charles (1957, p. 302) and Kennedy (op. cit.) studied the adjustment of former students of special classes in the community and found only six per cent and eight per cent of the homes were definitely below the average.
Kratter (1958, p. 270), Shaw & Wright (1960, p. 274), and Sheridan (1956, p. 92) concluded many borderline defectives make fairly satisfactory housekeepers and parents if their circumstances are familiar and they do not have too many children. Mickelson (op. cit.) studied 90 families in which one or both of the parents had been diagnosed as mentally defective and had been sterilized. She attempted to isolate some of the variables associated with successful parenthood. She found 42 per cent had given satisfactory care to their children, 32 per cent questionable care, and 26 per cent inadequate care. Above IQ of 50, the mental status did not seem to be the sole determinant of satisfactory child care since some mothers with IQ's in the 70's provided less satisfactory care than mothers in the 50-59 range; 46 per cent

104 Bass Eugen. Quart.

of mothers in the 50-59 range were in
the successful category, compared to 33
per cent in the 70-79 range. Only 30
per cent in the 30-49 range were rated
as satisfactory. The satisfactoriness of
child care increased as the number of
pregnancies and living children de-
creased.
As a result of his work with the re-
tarded, Sarason made the following hy-
pothesis about the child-rearing prac-
tices of the retarded: "The defective
mother does not plan to have the child,
probably experiences its presence as an
unnecessary annoyance, does not possess
adequate knowledge of or receive guid-
ance in child care, and is probably more
concerned with her own than the child's
needs" (1953, pp. 157-159).
Thome (1957, p. 463) found the re-
tarded expressed the desire to have chil-
dren even after their limited capacity to
care for them had been pointed out.
The Departmental Committee ap-
pointed in England in 1932 to study
mental deficiency and sterilization re-
ported:
It is impossible in the present state of our knowledge about the causation of mental defects to forecast with certainty whether a child of any given union will exhibit mental abnormalities. It can, however, be shown that, whether the cause be bad heredity or adverse environmental conditions or both, the children of parents, one or both of whom are mentally defective, are, on the average, below normal, and our enquiry shows that nearly onethird of such children as survive are likely to be defective, and more than two-fifths must be expected to exhibit some degree of mental abnormality (1934, p. 21).
In several studies the death rate of
retarded children has been found to be
higher than that of normal children
(Brandon, 1957, p. 725; Halperin, 1946,

p. 154; Shaw & Wright) as indicated in Table 1. The higher deaths are due in part to the lower physical resistance of the retarded, but may also be an indication of inadequate care.
Illegitimacy may be another indicator of the quality of the child rearing practices. In the past, there was a belief that the illegitimacy rate for the retarded was much higher than that for the mentally normal. This stereotype was challenged by the findings of Pearson & Amacher (1956) in a study of 3,594 unwed mothers. The distribution of IQ's was similar to that for the general population. Kennedy (1948) found the rate to be twice that of the controls, while Ainsworth, Wagner, & Strauss found a rate of over twice that of Kennedy's findings.
Divorce is sometimes a factor in the adequacy of child care. The rate found by Dinger only slightly exceeded that of the national average, while that found by Kennedy was three times as great as the average.
Two studies were made to determine whether retarded parents might be helped to give their children better care and what methods proved most efficacious. Mitchell (1947) made a study of 28 families in which one or both of the parents were retarded. She found that social work practices produced improvement in 17 cases, but this was mostly the result of direct aid such as sending the children to camp. She concluded that supervision produced little improvement in budgeting or in general child care. The prognosis was especially poor when the parent's IQ was below 60. Mickelson (1949) concluded from her two studies of 90 mentally retarded families that of the three community services: (1) supervision with some direct service to the children, (2) institutionalization of the parents, and (3) sterilization; the last

made the greatest contribution to the satisfactoriness of child care.

Despite evidence indicating many retarded are capable of marriage but not of rearing children, the frequency of operations in the institutions for the retarded has decreased from approximately 1,500 annually in 1946 to 500 in 1961 (Russell, 1962, p. 17). These figures are based on reports from states having sterilization laws and include only sterilizations performed in state hospitals and those few authorized in states having extra-mural provisions (Human Betterment, 1961). There are no statistics on operations performed by private physicians at the request of the patient or parent.
What are the factors limiting the use of sterilization? While there is a greater acceptance among the Protestants of the need for sterilization, the religious objections of the Catholic church remain an important factor in limiting the operations. The reports of abuses of the sterilization law by the Nazis left a most unfavorable impression despite the findings of Myerson (1936, p. 22) and Harmsen (1954) that the law was carefully considered, contained many safeguards, and was meticulously and impartially administered by nonpolitical courts until the time when the Nazis became completely demoralized.
The objections most often encountered are that sterilization might encourage promiscuity; that persons might be sterilized for insufficient reasons; there might be psychological ill-effects; patients might later regret they had had the operation. Voluntary sterilization was found not to increase promiscuity (Butler, 1945; Popenoe & Gosney, 1946, pp. 35-37). There is no evidence that

persons will be sterilized for insufficient reason. A Danish study (Kempe, 1947, p. 7) found not one single such case among 3,500 persons who had been sterilized during the 16 years the law had been in effect. There was little danger of this possibility since every case was passed upon by several mutually independent medical boards.
Several investigations have been made of the psychological effects of sterilization and almost no appreciable evidence of ill-effects has been found (Craig, 1957). Guttmacher's study of 157 women found only 4.7 regretted having had the operation; Barnes & Zurpan (1958, p. 69) found 10 per cent dissatisfied; Ekblad (1962) found 11 per cent of Swedish women dissatisfied, consisting mostly of childless women and persons with abnormal personalities; Woodside found 11 per cent regretted the operation. Similar results have been found among the males of normal mentality: 47 out of 50 were satisfied with the operation and, if they were to be faced with the same decision again, they would choose to have the operation (Gamble, 1950).
A follow-up study of 6,255 insane and mentally deficient men and women who had been sterilized found that the general reaction to the operation was indifference. One out of seven were dissatisfied but gave no rational reason (Popenoe, 1929). A second independent study of 10,000 gave similar results (Popenoe & Gosney, 1946, p. 7).
Another objection often encountered is the permanence and irreversibility of the operation. In the case of divorce and remarriage or in the event of the death of one or more children, there might be a desire for more children. Research is in process to improve the techniques of the operation so that reversal may be possible in a majority of cases. The re-

suits of Schmidt's (1961) research indicate that restoration of fertility will be possible in a much larger proportion of cases than the present success rate of approximately 50 per cent for males. Phadke performed 30 reversal operations on men in India, seven of whom had been sterilized from eight to twelve years previously. Sperm was found in 29 of these men after the re-anasatomosis and 20 of their wives had conceived at the time of the study (Blacker, 1962).
Reversal, however, should be recommended only under extraordinary circumstances and no person should be sterilized under the belief that he can have the operation reversed if he changes his mind.
Uncertainty regarding the legal status of sterilization is another important deterrent.
LEGAL ASPECTS OF STERILIZATION
This investigator analyzed the followup reports of 74 individuals who requested and received the operation from the Human Betterment Association for Voluntary Sterilization. Thirty-five per cent of these had previously asked their doctor or a member of the hospital staff for sterilization and had been refused. In another random sample of 14 out of 142 cases in which sterilization was requested, 36 per cent had previously been refused. The reasons given fell into two main categories: either the doctor was Catholic or he had said the operation could not be done because it was against the law.
Concern for the legal risks involved for the physician render it most difficult for many patients to obtain a sterilization operation. In many instances this is due to lack of information concerning the law. There is a law restricting voluntary sterilization in only three states.

Connecticut, Kansas, and Utah limit non-institutional cases to the therapeutic situations where there is evidence of medical necessity. In all the remaining states there is no law either for or against voluntary sterilization, while 28 states have laws pertaining to compulsory sterilization (Human Betterment).
The legal counsel for the Human Betterment Association for Voluntary Sterilization (Pilpel, 1961), an agency which has been helping individuals with a demonstrated need to secure the operation, gave the opinion that there was no record of any physician losing a suit when the proper consent form had been signed by the patient. This decision assumed there was no malpractice involved.
REPORTS OF COMMITTEES APPOINTED TO
STUDY STERILIZATION
This investigation has revealed no evidence of any report of a medical or social welfare committee appointed to study the problem of sterilization which has not recognized the advisability of voluntary sterilization under certain circumstances.
For over thirty years, committees and conferences of experts have been recommending sterilization as one means of promoting the welfare of the retarded individual. The Committee on Physically and Mentally Handicapped at the White House Conference on Child Health and Protection reported:
There is little doubt that properly drafted laws permitting sterilization are constitutional and that the operation necessary (vasectomy or salpingectomy) causes no recognizable alterations in personality and is not attended by appreciable mortality. Hence, there are no surgical, legal, or humanitarian obstacles to the extensive practice of selective sterilization (1930, p. 313).

The White House Conference of 1960 was not as specific in its language but the intent of the recommendations appears similar. It is possible that the terms sterilization and birth control were not used out of deference to the small minority whose religious dogma is opposed to these medically accepted measures. Regarding family life education, it was resolved:
That family life courses, including preparation for marriage and parenthood, be instituted as an integral and major part of public education from elementary school through high school; and that the formal education emphasize the primary importance of family life and particularly the childbearing role of the mother (p. 12).
Regarding size of family, it was resolved:
The planning for the size of families is desirable in order to relieve the deprivation of children, and that facilities and programs on a local, public, private basis be available to married couples providing medical advice and services for child spacing consistent with the creed and mores of the families being served (p. 14).
For the unmarried adolescent, it was resolved: "That educational measures sensitive to moral and emotional factors be instituted" (p. 79). Regarding the mentally handicapped, it was resolved: "That greater emphasis be placed on study and research in the field of genetics and on genetic counseling, to decrease and prevent the hereditary forms of mental retardation" (p. 587).
Myerson, reporting for the committee appointed by the American Neurological Society, wrote in 1936:
There need be no hesitation in recommending sterilization in the case of feeble-mindedness, though it need not, of course, be urged in those conditions which are of definite environmental origin. Though we hesitate to stress purely social necessity for sterilization,

it is obvious that in the case of the feeble-minded, there may be a social as well as biological situation of importance. Certain of the feebleminded can only, under the most favorable conditions, care for themselves, and a family of children may prove an overwhelming burden (1936, p. 180).
In England, the Departmental Committee on Sterilization, sometimes referred to as the Brock Committee, appointed in 1934, unanimously recommended voluntary sterilization after studying evidence supplied by 60 experts in the field. They recommended that voluntary sterilization be legalized and the "right to sterilization be extended to all persons whose family history gives reasonable grounds for believing that they may transmit mental or physical defect" (1934, p. 41).
STUDIES OF STERILIZATION
In addition to the references of Goodenough, who strongly recommended sterilization for every mentally retarded person of child-bearing age who was not in an institution, many other authorities in the field have recommended it for the well-being of the patient and the family. The superintendent of Pennhurst wrote: "Although attended by many ethical, legal, and religious problems the question of the advantages and the ethical and religious propriety of selective sterilization . . . merit the consideration of all the agencies interested in human welfare" (Dean, 1945, p. 501). Johnson found sterilized mental defectives tended to make more satisfactory adjustments. There was a two per cent failure rate among the sterilized discharged patients compared with a 17 per cent for nonsterilized (1946, pp. 444^45) Shatter (1957, p. 605) tested sterilization as a criterion for release. His results, though the difference was not significant, showed

108 Bass Eugen. Quart.

a higher success rate for those who had been sterilized.
Davies (1959, p. 64) questions the general use of eugenic sterilization as a means of social control to reduce the incidence of mental deficiency. He does not attempt to explore the adequacy of the child-rearing practices of the retarded nor their image of the role of parenthood. No mention is made of voluntary sterilization as a therapeutic measure for the physical, psychological, and socioeconomic well-being of the patient.
A superintendent of the Oregon Fairview Home recommended sterilization because:
The mentally deficient person is not a suitable parent for either a normal or subnormal child, and children would be an added burden to an already handicapped individual who does well to support himself. It would be unfair to the state, to the individual, and particularly to his potential children, to permit his release without the protection of sterilization (Hill, 1950, p. 403).
Dr. Whitney, past president of the
AAMD wrote: "Sterilization . . . offers a
potential for prevention not adequately
tested due largely to public inertia"
(1958, p. 391).
Kratter wrote: "Much neglect, such as
ill treatment of children, could be pre-
vented if persons intellectually and emo-
tionally unfit to rear children could be
sterilized" (1958, p. 271). He went on to
add that the decision should not be made
solely on the basis of IQ but that each
case should be considered individually.
Penrose wrote:
Sterilization is apparently the best means of preventing reproduction of the mentally deficient, particularly for the feeble-minded. . . . There are, at present, no legal, surgical, or humanitarian obstacles to the extensive prac-

tice of selective sterilization of the adult feeble-minded; these facts should be impressed on the consciousness of every responsible citizen. . . . Of all the methods mentioned, selective sterilization is perhaps open to the least objection, especially where the feebleminded are concerned, but in view of the adverse opinion prevailing in some quarters it is probable that many cases in which it could well be used must, for some time in the future, be dealt with by means of segregation or contraception, in spite of the injustice to the individual and the social risks involved (1932, pp. 191-192).
Thirty years after Penrose wrote the above, the Annotations of the Lancet of January 1962 contained a similar conclusion after reporting the Swedish study (1962) of 225 women who had been sterilized: "Too much weight may often be given to the risk of psychological complications. Indeed, preoccupation with this risk may cause the operation to be denied to those handicapped people who need it the most" (p. 88).
IMPLICATIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY
Many questions have been raised by this investigation:
How many retarded individuals capable of living in the community are in institutions for the sole purpose of preventing reproduction?
At what level of intelligence is it possible for a retarded individual to understand the nature of sterilization and give a valid consent? What factors influence his consent to the operation?
What role does the mental ability of the parents have on the kind of home they establish and on the quality of child-rearing practices?
Among the mentally deficient, what is the image of the role of the mother and father? What are their attitudes toward having children? What are their con-

cepts of the responsibilities of parenthood?
Is it possible to predict the adequacy of child-rearing practices?
What is the role of sterilization and birth control in therehabilitation of the mentally deficient young adult?
What are the attitudes of parents of retarded children toward voluntary sterilization? Do these differ in states where there is compulsory sterilization as compared to states where there isno such law? What are the attitudes of parents toward laws prohibiting themarriage of the "weak-minded"?
What are the psychological effects of sterilization on the retarded?
SUMMARY
This investigation suggests that marriage can be recommended for retarded individuals in an appreciable per cent of cases, but that it is often advisable to prevent parenthood for the benefit of the individual and his potential child. There is some evidence of the inability of the retardate to use temporary methods of contraception. Most authorities agree that surgical birth control isthe most appropriate of the existing methods for the retarded. Some objections were given. Several scientific andreligious groups have condemned compulsory sterilization andendorsed voluntary sterilization and its use has increased notably among the general population. The lack of information in this area was pointed out and several questions for further study were presented.
