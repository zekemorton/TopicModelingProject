O.'NE OF THE MOST DISTINCTIVE FEATURES
of our age is the rapid multiplication of our species, homo sapiens.
The present growth of world population is utterly unique in human history. This can be painfully demonstrated from bits of historical evidence. But a little simple arithmetic will show that this must be true. The present annual world population growth is estimated at well over 30 million and perhaps as high as 40 million a year. Had this amount of growth continued throughout the Christian era, there would now be 60-80 billions of us rather than the actual figure of about 2.6 billion. At the present rate of growth (which is estimated to be at least 1.2 per cent per year) the entire population of the globe would be descended from a single couple living at the time of Christ. An Argentinian demographer has carried the illustration to its logical conclusion: if the population of two living in the Garden of Eden some 6000 years ago had increased on the average of 1 per cent per year the present human population would be so vast that it would have standing room only, not just on the surface of the earth, but on the surface of a sphere with a radius 14 times the orbit of the planet Neptune. Obviously the amount of current population growth could have existed only in brief periods of man's history.
The Growth Potential
The magnitude of the population problem of the modern world therefore is completely new. It is the problem of the enormous growth unleashed by the splendid success of our civilization in preserving

human life. The armentorium of modern medicine and public health, applied within the public order maintained by the modern state, have made possible the doubling of the average expectation of life at birth. For Americans and Europeans the expectation is 20 years longer than in our grandparents' generation and 40 years longer than in 17th-century Europe. This is perhaps the greatest material achievement of our civilization.
This achievement took centuries in the West; but in countries more recently undergoing modernization, this is happening much more rapidly--in a matter of decades or even a few years. In Ceylon for example a simple program of systematically spraying all human habitations with DDT resulted in a cut in half in the death rate in the eight years between 1945 and 1953. This program in Ceylon has been carried out with a total expenditure of about two dollars per individual per year on public health.
Comparable achievements in the next decade among the two-thirds of us who live in underdeveloped areas would double the average rate of world population growth actually experienced since World War II. This may not be possible. But with a modicum of peace and prosperity it is a realizable goal in 20 years. Without declines in the birth rate this would mean an average world population growth of about 2}4 per cent per year. We are faced with the probability that world population growth will very soon accelerate to 114 or 2 per cent per year. Could and will such growth be maintained?
In the broad sweep of history the answer to both questions is unequivocally no. In the shorter run, say over the next generation, the answer is probably yes.

Such growth is by definition a transitional phase in the dynamics of human population. It could not have existed for any long period in the past; it cannot exist for any really long period in the future. It is an inexorable law of compound interest that the present growth continued even for a few centuries would literally crowd us off the earth.
At the postwar rate of growth, the world's population will achieve 40 billion in 250 years. This would mean an average density of 750 per square mile (the present density of England and Wales) over the entire land surface of the earth, including tundra, mountains and deserts. At double the rate of recent growth, which is a short-term possibility, this situation would be reached about the year 2065, or a little more than a century from now. The Choices
Even assuming that resources could be found to feed such masses, birth rates in the next century must fall or our species will face a cramped and penurious existence that few of us would like to contemplate. The longer-range alternative is a return to a grim struggle for existence that would raise death rates to former levels. Barring the early colonization and exploitation of other planets and heavenly bodies, birth rates must fall or deaths from starvation, from disease, and from war must again rise.
But we have a period of grace, perhaps two or three generations, in which to work out a new biological balance. For that period the world may be able to support a rapid rate of population growth through more effective use of resources and without being reduced to a diet of algae and yeast.
Fortunately the species .has already started along the path needed to bring about a new and more humane balance of births and deaths. As is now widely known, the great gains in postponing deaths in the advanced countries of the West have been partially matched by subsequent declines in the birth rate.
It is natural that a decline in the birth

rate should follow rather than precede the decline of the death rate in demographic evolution.
From time immemorial human beings have had the strongest biological, social and even religious compulsions to "increase and multiply." These compulsions have evoked persistently high birth rates throughout the world. Such reproduction was costly in terms of human wastage, since a large proportion of those born failed to achieve maturity. But high birth rates were necessary if the race were to survive the perils of life in all previous ages. It is the very modern achievements in the postponement of death that make it possible and practical to spare the race the hardships and wastes of uncontrolled fertility. We are also witnessing great advances in the reduction of sterility. The rational control of family size thus has two aspects; first, it eliminates the necessity for irresponsible childbearing among those ill-equipped to provide numerous progeny with a good start in life. Second, it also enables many couples who othenvise would have been denied this privilege to share the duties and pleasures of rearing their own children. Toward a New Demographic Balance
1. The West. About one-third of the human race now exercises a substantial degree of voluntary control of family size. In a number of European countries the reduction of births had reached a point before World War II at which many persons both in Fascist and in democratic countries were becoming worried about the possibility of race suicide. The baby boom following the war dispelled the fears that people, given the means of voluntary control of family size, will necessarily fail to reproduce themselves. In fact, the wide fluctuations in the birth rate in the depression years, during the war, and in the postwar period have concealed a rather stable average family size in the West.
What matters in the long run is not the annual birth rate but the size of completed families. Recent analysis of cohort fertility,

that is, the fertility of women born in the same years and passing through life together, has given us new methods for analyzing fertility trends.1 Among white women born in the United States in 5-year periods from 1900 to 1925, the average number of children per woman has varied only between 2.3 for the women born 1905-1909 to a maximum of 2.7 for those born 1920-1924. The latter women of course have not completed their normal child-bearing years, but it is possible to make reasonable estimates of their final fertility performance on the basis of their experience thus far. These data indicate that the actual size of American families has not changed nearly so much as the annual birth rates might suggest.
Similar studies in Britain suggest that the average number of children per married woman has remained remarkably stable over the last 25 years at about 2.2 children per woman. This is about 5 per cent below the number necessary for permanent replacement.
It would seem that the industrial West is moving toward a new and more efficient reproduction in which low birth and death rates are roughly balanced in a new demographic equilibrium.
2. Areas in Transition. There is every reason to suppose that the huge populations of the underdeveloped areas, given the opportunity, will respond to the same incentives that have brought about the reductions of births in the West. Neither ideology nor great cultural barriers have stopped the decline of births in a country once modern influences have reached the mass of the people. Let me illustrate this, first, from the experience of Russia and second, from the experience of Japan.
The categorical anti-Malthusian doctrines of Communism, backed by the most comprehensive pro-natalist policies in exist-

ence, have apparently not been successful in checking very rapid declines in the Russian birth rate since the war. Before World War II the Russians were temporarily successful in checking the very rapid decline of births resulting from abortions in the early 1930's. This success was achieved by the simple expedient of closing down the free public abortion clinics. Since the war, however, the supplements to family wages on behalf of children and the "mother heroine medals" seem to have been ineffective in stopping the spread of the small-family pattern.
According to the population experts from the Soviet Union at the recent World Population Conference in Rome, the present birth rate in the Soviet Union is approximately 24 per thousand population, or slightly less than that in the United States. This represents a drastic decline from the prewar figure of 38 per thousand. If adjustment is made for the concentration of the Russian population in the young adult ages, the current fertility in the U.S.S.R. must be substantially below that in the U.S. When such a decline occurs in bourgeois countries, it is condemned as evidence of the refusal of parents to bring children into a world of capitalistic exploitation.
The case of Japan is equally revealing with reference to the extent to which the small family pattern may cross cultural barriers. Once Japan became predominantly urban and industrial, the traditional forces of Oriental familism and ancestor worship apparently failed to retard the decline of the birth rate. It is interesting to note that aside from fluctuations in the birth and death rates associated with wars, the pattern of vital rates in Japan during the last 35 years has very closely approximated the trend of birth and death rates in England 40 years earlier at a somewhat comparable stage of industralization. By 1953 the birth rate in Japan was 21.5, well below that of the United States and rapidly approaching European levels.

The specific means used to restrict family size may differ from country to country: in Ireland, through late marriage; in Western Europe, generally, by birth control; in Japan, by abortions, which Japanese experts report now number over one million a year, despite growing efforts by the Japanese Government to introduce less drastic methods of family limitation; and, in Puerto Rico and increasingly elsewhere, by post-partum sterilization of women in hospitals, at the request of the women concerned and generally following the delivery of their fourth or fifth child. The birth rate has declined wherever people have become literate, urbanized, and free of the debilitating psychological and physical effects of the major epidemic diseases. Population Growth and Economic Progress
There is every probability that all segments of the human race will acquire the small-family pattern in the event of major transformation of their societies through industrialization and modernization. The problem is rather the degree to which and the speed with which this will occur. In some cases population growth itself may so handicap economic progress as to prevent the kind of material progress associated with birth declines.
This is difficult for many in the underdeveloped areas to understand. Population growth per se has been quite properly regarded historically as a sign of progress and prosperity. Indeed, the two, economic growth and population growth, have gone together. And for the first time hope is being held out that the human race as a whole, not just a single class or master race, can be freed from the degradation of grinding poverty and needless suffering. This hope is justified by technical achievements and by the rising capacity to produce. Probably the cornucopia-minded are correct in asserting that the world could meet these expectations for its present numbers. But a large part of the economic gains must each year be diverted to provide new places at the world's table rather than to improve

the fare of those already here. To use a different figure of speech, some countries, like the Red Queen in "Alice Through the Looking-Glass," must run faster and faster simply to stay in the same place.
The "world population problem" turns out on inspection to be a series of regional and national problems. Much more important than the total resources theoretically available in the world as a whole are the specific resources available in relation to the populations of specific countries and regions. In fact even here the oft-discussed framework of the relation of people to resources offers a somewhat inadequate statement of the problem. Quite as important as the physical resources in relation to the population are the crucial intervening variables that determine how effectively the physical resources are used and converted to meet the needs of the populations. The equations of technology, social organization, and especially political stability may be quite as important in determining levels of living as the stock of physical resources.
Furthermore, the future birth rates are not matters that will be decided in the long run by governmental policies. The future trend of the birth rate in the underdeveloped areas, as in the industrial West, will be a matter of choice and action of millions of individuals. These are only within limits amenable to the influence of public policy calculated to change population trends.
The real question is the extent to which individual families will achieve the right and the ability to improve their lot by control of their own destiny. People will be guided, not by abstract ratios of population to resources, but by the extent to which individual and familial aspirations can be met by limiting family size. The actual population trends are not really so responsive to poverty as such as to the changing motivations of individuals. Where economic aspirations outrun the means of satisfying them, as is increasingly characteristic of people in underdeveloped areas,

22 Eugenics Quarterly-

it is reasonable that parents should turn to family limitation as a means of providing more opportunities for the children they do have. Consequently demography has become increasingly concerned with the sociopsychological aspects of fertility as opposed to purely economic motivations.
The differing stages in economic and social development existing in the world have given rise to differential population growth among regions. Many of the world's tensions and frictions may be traced back to the disequilibrium arising from the different stages of economic and demographic evolution achieved in the several parts of the world. Forecasts
Let us turn to present population growth and the outlook for future growth in the several major regions of the world. For this purpose we may use recent forecasts prepared by the Population Division of the United Nations relating to the period 19501980.2 These materials are presented in graphic form in Figures 1 and 2, and the basic data is in tabular form in Tables 1 and 2.
Figure 1 is intended to give historical perspective, illustrating the momentum and acceleration of absolute population growth in the world and its two great subdivisions: Asia-Africa, and the European settlement area, which includes Europe and the U.S.S.R., the Americas and Oceania. Since 1650 there has been a great expansion of the European population. In some periods this has exceeded even the absolute amount of growth in Asia and Africa, but the latter area has never lost its clear predominance in numbers. Current and foreseeable trends will widen this predominance.
The extent of this divergence will depend much on the situation in China. Un-

The estimates given in this document are provisional and may be revised for final publication.

til very recently it was generally accepted that the population of China was under 500 million and that it was growing little if at all. The United Nations estimates incorporates this assumption in their forecasts. Only last month, however, reports from the first modern census in China, taken in 1953, indicate a population of not 500 million but close to 600 million increasing at 2 per cent per year. If these latter figures for China were used in the projections, the world estimate for 1980 would be close to 4 billion rather than the 3.6 billion shown on this chart.
Figure 2 shows the United Nations forecasts in greater detail, this time on a logarithmic scale in which parallel lines indicate equal rates of growth, rather than equal amounts of increase.
All regions are growing and will continue to grow barring a major catastrophe. It is natural that demographic evolution should have proceeded further in Western Europe, the birthplace of modern industrial civilization. But despite somber predictions made by myself and others a decade ago no population decline in Europe is yet in prospect. In fact there is some suggestion that the very appearance of decline, as in France before the war, will bring about reactions in public policy and private attitudes sufficient to restore a moderate rate of growth.
Eastern Europe is the one major region in which the demographic losses of World War II are discernible in the population curve, partly of course as a result of mass expulsions. If very recent information on the rapidity of the decline in the birth rate in the U.S.S.R. and the satellite countries is accurate, the United Nations forecasts for this area are too high.
In overseas Europe, i.e., in the United States, in Canada, in Australasia, and in temperate zones of South America, population growth is still rapid and above the world average. While present growth rates may not be maintained, we may expect continued growth at a less rapid pace, both

from immigration and from the excess of births over deaths.
Latin America is the most rapidly growing major region. It is now surpassing America north of the Rio Grande in population. Even with an orderly demographic evolution on the pattern of Europe, it will have very rapid increase over the next generation. To the extent that weight of numbers contributes to regional importance, Latin America will play a growing role in world affairs.
But the biological fate of the species will be decided in Asia, which now, as throughout recorded history, is the principal home of man. Only catastrophe will prevent an enormous growth of population in Asia, a growth that is gaining momentum with each new success in public health. This is both necessary and desirable. But the most rapid present and potential growth often is in areas least well endowed in terms of physical and cultural resources to meet the needs of an expanding population.
The United Nations forecasts a population of 2.0 billion in Asia in 1980, or 2.3 billion if we adjust for the new reports of population growth in China. I have already mentioned that almost 600 million people in China are now reported to be growing at the rate of 2 per cent, or about 12 million persons, per year, the difference between the reported birth rate of 37 and the reported death rate of 17 per thousand population. It is difficult to imagine but that such a growth is a very serious handicap to economic development in so crowded a land under whatever political system.
On the other hand, population growth in such crowded countries of the free world as India and Indonesia imposes a heavy handicap on their development by democratic methods. Capital formation at best involves hardships in such poor countries, and the task is greatly increased if economic gains must be consumed in feeding several more million people each year. Population growth may itself contribute to frustrations pushing the people and gov-

ernments of these lands to more drastic political and economic methods.
It is to be hoped that the very rapidity of population growth, brought about by splendid achievements in saving lives, may herald a more rapid demographic transition in Asia than occurred in the West. If this is not the case, Asia may never be successful in extricating herself from the vicious circle of poverty, ignorance and over-population that has been her lot in recent centuries. Possible Effects of War
Finally, it must be evident that the above forecasts ignore the possibility of a major war. While we may not care to think of war as a "normal" phenomenon it certainly is a possibility within the time span covered by these projections.
The demographic impact of modern war has been greatly exaggerated in the popular imagination. While war losses of the two World Wars seriously reduced selected populations, their impact was temporary and local, viewing the world as a whole. Their impact was negligible in retarding the forward march of world population growth. Aside from the single case of Eastern Europe one would have to look very closely on the two figures to detect any effects of the two World Wars.
This does not in any way minimize the personal tragedy or horror of war. It merely reflects the fact that the social and biological forces leading to world population growth represent basic and powerful forces that were only very temporarily checked by the two World Wars.
Another war, fought with the arsenal of horrible new weapons, might of course be far more disastrous to the species. But only about 5 per cent of the world's population lives in its 60 odd urban agglomerations of over one million inhabitants. The destruction of all our major cities would not directly destroy a large part of the human race. For that matter four or five normal years of world population growth would completely replace the population of the

The possible meaning of these qualitative statements in terms of possible future populations of the several major regions have been illustrated in the charting of the population estimates made by the United Nations. These forecasts indicate continued population growth in every major region of the world, at least up to 1980. The greatest absolute population growth will probably take place in Asia.
