MULTIPLE ANOMALIES IN GONGENITALLY DEAF CHILDREN
JACOB M. DANISH,* J . KARETAS TILLSON, and MAX LEVITAN

INTRODUCTION
Genetic etiology is recognized as the commonest determinable cause of perceptive deafness in children (Johnsen, 1954). However, infection and injury, both during embryonic development and after birth, also play a prominent part in the etiology of deafness. It would be interesting to know the relative frequency of deafness from various causes and whether these different causes produce deafness in similar ways. In this paper an approach to this question will be made by studying a deaf population and determining whether deafness of different etiology is accompanied by different associated anomalies.
Interest in congenital deafness is not limited to the specialty of otology. Because visceral defects may be associated, this anomaly is worthy of study by other branches of medicine. The presence of any congenital anomaly in any patient justifies search for other coexistent abnormalities. This has been demonstrated in studies of congenital anorectal anomalies, for instance, by Mayo and Rice (1950), who reported associated anomalies in 51.8% of males and 36.3% of females, and by Ladd and Gross (1934), who found "other anomalies" in 26% of 162 patients, some with as many as 7 or

8. The importance of the associated anomaly was indicated by the fact that in 12 cases the other anomaly was serious enough to be responsible for the death of the patient. In another discussion of the same subject, Baldi and Bigardi (1960) assert that associated malformations may influence the treatment and prognosis of the primary disorder. Similarly, associated abnormalities may influence the treatment, education, and vocational adjustment of the congenitally deaf.
Search of the literature disclosed that deafness was mentioned in association with the following:
1. Keratitis (Cogan's syndrome) (Eisenstein and Taubenhaus, 1958)
2. Lenticular abnormalities (Sohar, 1954)
3. Juvenile Optic Atrophy (Leber's Disease) (Gates, 1946, page 221)
4. Retinitis Pigmentosa (Gates, 1946, pages 78, 210)
5. Waardenburg's Syndrome (Waardenburg, 1951)
6. Mental retardation (Pearson, 1912)
7. Endemic goiter (Johnsen, 1958) 8. Non-endemic goiter (Pendred's
Syndrome) (Pendred, 1896) 9. Nodular Goiter and Thyroid Car-
cinoma (Elman, 1958) 10. Friederich's Ataxia (Gates, 1946,

26. Syndrome of Retinal Degeneration, Obesity, and Diabetes Mellitus (Alstrom et al., 1959)
27. Certain trisomic syndromes (Patau et al., 1960; Edwards et al., 1960).
Since it is difficult to evaluate the hearing status of the very young or the mentally retarded, this list may be incomplete.
Deafness may be fortuitous in some of these conditions and frequent in others. It is encountered more or less regularly in such syndromes as Waardenburg's, hereditary nephropathy, hereditary interstitial pyelonephritis, and the cited trisomic syndromes. In the first mentioned, variations of incidence are ascribed to differences in penetrance (Waardenburg, 1951). Deafness also occurs commonly in

association with retinitis pigmentosa and osteogenesis imperfecta. In other congenital or hereditary abnormalities listed above, it has been reported sporadically. The present study was undertaken to determine whether conclusions could be drawn concerning the prevalence of associated abnormalities in the congenitally deaf as compared with other types of deafness. In addition, unusual incidence of particular anomalies was looked for which might reveal a predilection of other anomalies towards deafness. These associations, if found, might indicate genetic or ontogenetic association.
METHODS
We reviewed the preadmission health reports and infirmary records of the students in residence at the Pennsylvania School for the Deaf during the school year 1960-61. Ages ranged from 4 to 20 years. Information concerning other cases of deafness in the family and the parents' report of the cause of deafness was usually included. The latter was of varying reliability. In most cases the parents' statement was based on a physician's evaluation; in others, however, this was the parents' judgment. The headmaster of the school and the infirmary nurse are intimately acquainted with each student and were helpful in completing and correcting deficient histories.
On the basis of the above-mentioned written and verbal reports, the 499 available charts were classified as shown in Table 1. Thirty-two were deleted because of insufficient data upon which to base classification or because they were cases of auditory agnosia and auditory aphasia, which are not strictly deafness. The rest were divided into three categories following the scheme of Van Egmond (1954):

third group. These were children who were never known to have been able to hear, who had no history of an illness or accident which might have caused their deafness, and whose histories did not mention suspected prenatal or neonatal deafness-inducing factors.
The probability of a hereditary factor is strengthened where a close family history of deafness exists (Close, 1961). Class 3 was therefore subdivided into 'probable' and 'presumptive.' 'Probable' indicated deafness in the family of the affected; 'presumptive,' no mention of deafness in the family.

1. Acquired deafness 2. Congenital, nonhereditary deafness 3. Congenital, apparently hereditary
deafness. All children who suffered an illness or accident to which their doctors or parents ascribed the hearing defect are included in category 1, despite the fact that in many cases these incidents occurred at an age when already existing deafness would have been difficult to recognize. In other cases the child was known to have been able to hear and speak prior to the loss of hearing so that the causal relationship was more convincing. Because of insufficient data, no attempt wasmade to uncover delayed onset hereditary deafness, some cases of which may be included here.
Erythroblastosis, kernicterus, maternal rubella, and other viral diseases in pregnancy, birth trauma, and prematurity were accepted as etiological factors when reported as having occurred. These cases were placed in our second category: congenital, nonhereditary deafness. Note that heredity played an indirect role in many of these, those ascribed to erythroblastosis and maternal diabetes, for example.
The remainder were placed in the

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The reported causes of 'acquired' deafness are listed in Table 2. Of the 145 children in this group, meningitis was the most common assumed cause of the deafness (54 cases). It is of interest that measles was as important as otitis in producing defective hearing (12 cases each). Table 3 shows the associated abnormalities in these children. Forty, or 27.6%, were reported to have additional abnormalities, including 5 (3.4%) who had more than one defect besides the deafness.
Table 4 is a breakdown of the 82 cases of congenital, but probably nonhereditary, deafness and other defects present. Deafness was not an isolated defect except in the group of subjects prenatally exposed to maternal measles (7 cases) and miscellaneous maternal illnesses (5 cases). Among these 12 there was only one child with another defect besides deafness, and this washyperopic astigmatism in a child whose mother had measles during pregnancy. Not included was a child who developed otosclerosis at the age of 10. The prevalence of multiple defects in the remainder of this group was striking, cerebral palsy occurring in

12 of the 25 cases of Rh incompatibility, in 5 of the 10 cases of birth injury, and one each in neonatal jaundice and prematurity. This array of defects is not surprising in this class of deafness, since me noxious factors are known not to be specific for any single organ system.
Table 5 shows the defects found among the 240 children in group 3. It will be noted that 50.4% had at least one defect in addition to deafness. This is almost twice the frequency among the children with acquired deafness. Also noteworthy is the fact that many of the children in group 3 had defects involving several body systems. Thus 39 (16.2%) of these children had multiple defects, whereas only five (3.4%) of the 145 children in category 1 had more than one defect besides deafness.

ted to critical statistical evaluation because, as previously noted, we made use of reported data which varied in accuracy among the children. Certain relationships are suggestive, however, and warrant further study. These are tabulated in Table 6, which compares the frequency of various groups of anomalies in the three categories of deafness. We were particularly interested in comparing the defects encountered in groups 1 and 3. Group 1 may be regarded as a rough control to group 3, a basis for comparing, as it were, genetically and environmentally determined deafness

with respect to the number and kinds of associated anomalies. However, it was in group 2 that we encountered the largest number o£ multiple defects, 59.8% of these children having one or more impairments in addition to the hearing disability. Neurological defects, particularly cerebral palsy, were most prominent

in this group. Deafness in these children is probably part of the widespread effect of whatever insult gives rise to brain damage in this group of children. It should be noted here that some of the nervous system defects not classified as cerebral palsy may indeed be included as such. Cardiac abnormalities were also

more frequent in this group, two cases occurring in those with a history of Rh incompatibility, two associated with maternal rubella, and one in the birth injury group. Eye defects were more frequent in this group than in the 'acquired' deaf, but less than in group 3. Note, however, that retinitis pigmentosa occurred only in those with hereditary deafness. Genitourinary anomalies occurred equally in group 2 and group 3.
When the incidence of anomalies in groups 1 and 3 are compared by major categories (Table 6), refractive errors, retinitis pigmentosa, other eye defects, and defects of the lower urinary tract appear to be significantly more frequent in children with genetic deafness than would be expected if relative sample size were the only difference between the two samples. Larger sampling and more accurate observations might reveal significant differences in other defects. Note, for example, that traits, such as Waardenburg's syndrome and strabismus, known to have a major hereditary basis occur more frequently in group 3 than in group 1. Several defects occur in both groups. It should be noted, however, that in no case was the frequency of anomalies in the 'acquired deaf higher than expected relative to the size of the sample.
It is interesting that a number of the conditions listed in the literature as associated with deafness (see Introduction) appear rarely or not at all in this series. It is possible that the association of some of these conditions with congenital deafness may be fortuitous, as may well be the case with some of the associated defects that we found but which have not been previously reported. Where deafness is a regular part of a reported syndrome, the absence of this syndrome from our sample suggests that it is rare

among the deaf as well as in the population as a whole.
One may speculate whether some of the multiple defects in these data may not be partial expressions of known syndromes; in fact, some cases of congenital deafness, even without other defects, may be incomplete expressions or 'formesfrustes' of such entities.
Multiple defects may be explained in various ways. They may be accounted for by pleiomorphism of single genes, multiple abnormal genes, gross chromosomal abnormality, variations in gene expressivity, or interaction between environmental and genetic influence. When any of these mechanisms are involved in early differentiation, many derivative structures may be affected, thereby giving rise to multiple defects, possibly involving diverse organ systems (Corner, 1960).
This study shows that, just as in many types of environmentally induced deafness, there is an association between genetic mechanisms producing deafness and the production of defects of other systems, and it suggests that an ontogenetic relationship exists among these defects. The further study of deaf children, by increasing the sample and strengthening its statistical validity, should define more accurately which of the conditions are regularly related, which occasional or fortuitous. Recognition of relationships among congenital defects would be useful to physicians and to those engaged in the training of congenitally handicapped children, as well as to geneticists and embryologists. The problem is an interdisciplinary one, meriting the cooperation of pediatrician, otologist, internist, geneticist and other specialists. To resolve it requires a program which could include:
1. Accurate determination of type of

hearing loss. 2. Investigation of pedigree and estab-
lishment of hereditary basis. 3. Study of individuals to detect pres-
ence of associated inherited defects. 4. Chromosomal studies.
SUMMARY
The medical records of 499 students in the Pennsylvania School for the Deaf were reviewed to determine the incidence of congenital anomalies. Information in these records permitted separation of the children into three groups: 1) acquired deafness, 2) congenital, nonhereditary deafness, and 3) congenital, apparently hereditary deafness.
There was a greater incidence of associated defects in those with congenital deafness as compared with those whose deafness followed postnatal illness or injury. In the former, multiple defects were also more frequent. Differences in the types of anomalies appeared when congenital deafness was separated into hereditary and nonhereditary causes.
