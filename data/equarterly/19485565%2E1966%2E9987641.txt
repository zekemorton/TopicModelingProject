In recent years studies of differential fertility in the United States have been marked by an increased interest in psychological factors associated with fertility. (Goldfarb and Erlenmeyer-Kimling, 1962; Riser and Whelpton, 1946-58; and Westoff, 1960; Westoff etal., 1961). However, little information is available concerning the fertility of population sectors with significant psychological impairment, the mentally ill. For example, among these major recent studies, only the Goldfarb and Erlenmeyer-Kimling study of schizophrenics in New York State deals with a patient population.
In contrast to the lacunae of such studies in the United States, a number of European studies have focused specifically on the fertility of mental patients. Their findings indicate that the fertility of mental patients is not greater than that of the nonpatient population and for certain diagnostic groups is considerably less, principally as the result of a lowered marriage rate (Book, 1959; Essen-Moller, 1959; Lewis, 1958, 1959). Similarly, Goldfarb and Erlenmeyer-Kimling indicate that the patients they have studied, schizophrenics, have as few childless marriages as the general population; and they have nearly as many children per marriage and per fertile marriage. The total reproduction of all patients studied, however, is slightly lower than the U.S. population per se because of their lower marriage rate.

The European studies and the Goldfarb study suggest that the contribution of mental patients to the gene pool of the population is little reduced by lowered fertility within marriage; and where the contribution is reduced, it is due primarily to lowered marriage rates. Such conclusions, however, should be further examined since the studies upon which these findings are based are limited in a number of ways. First, the studies have been restricted to single diagnostic groups--schizophrenics, affectives, or mental defectives, for example. Second, previous studies have dealt primarily with patients in treatment, yet recent changes in psychiatric treatment that have resulted in more frequent and earlier return to the community on the part of the mental patient may alter significantly these conclusions (Freeman and Simmons, 1963).
To determine whether previous findings may be extended to encompass patients from a variety of diagnostic groups, and the growing number of former mental patients, requires additional studies. Such studies must deal with a major methodological problem that has not always been resolved in other studies; that is, an adequate control group must be included in the analysis. Without such a control group it is difficult to determine whether the fertility of mental patients is associated with their psychological impairment or with other factors that are related to fertility as well as to mental illness.

from a study in which it has been possible to compare the fertility of former mental patients from a variety of diagnostic categories with a matched control sample. Therefore, the study differs from previous research in a number of ways. First, the patients represent a number of diagnostic groups including neurotics and alcoholics, as well as psychotics, who have been treated for mental illness in a psychiatric hospital or psychiatric outpatient clinic. Second, the patients are studied after treatment rather than at the time of psychiatric treatment. The study is restricted to patients who were under psychiatric care in 1950 but who were no longer in treatment in 1960. Finally, the patients' fertility experience is compared with a control group of never-treated cases who were matched individually with the patients on six sociodemographic variables: age, sex, marital status, social class (education and occupation), race, and religion.
The Patient Population
Data presented in this paper are part of a 10-year follow-up study of 1565 hospital and outpatient clinic patients enumerated in the 1950 New Haven psychiatric census (Hollingshead and Redlich, 1958; Myers and Roberts, 1959). The data presented in this paper are limited to the female patients still living and no longer under hospital care on June 1, 1960--in number, 164. Of the follow-up group of 164 females, 123 were in hospital treatment in 1950; 41, in clinic treatment. The clinic-hospital split is an important distinction for a number of reasons. First, the clinic-hospital separation is closely associated with diagnostic differences. Most of the outpatient clinic cases were diagnosed as neurotic or alcoholic (86%),

while most hospital cases (86%) were schizophrenics, affectives, or other psychotics. Next, the hospital patients by definition experienced some period of separation from family and community, thereby reducing, for young patients, the period of possible exposure to marriage and conception. For example, the total length of inpatient treatment for the hospitalized female patients ranged from 1 month to 22 years with the average length of hospitalization being 4 years 8 months, including all periods of treatment up to the 1960 period of observation. In contrast, of the 41 females included in this study who were treated in outpatient clinics, only 3 were ever treated in hospitals; the length of treatment ranging from 2 days to 12 months.
A final difference between the clinic and hospital patients that partially offsets the separation factor is that the hospital females were on the average older than the clinic patients at the time of the initial admission to psychiatric treatment. At the time of first admission, the median age of the clinic female patients was 26.5 years, and the median age of the hospital female patients was 33 years. Only 37% of the female clinic patients were past the age of 30 at the time of their first admission to treatment, but 60% of the hospital patients were similarly aged at the time of their first hospital admission. Therefore, at the time of their first admission to treatment, the hospitalized female patients were more likely to have been past the age when the majority of childbearing occurs.
Materials included in this paper are based both upon patient interviews and upon their medical records from psychiatric treatment agencies. Similar materials were secured from interviews with the matched control cases who were drawn from a systematic random sample of the New Haven community.

The female patients examined in this paper are not representative of the total 1950 female patient population, differing with respect to a number of variables that have been found to be associated with fertility. The discharged females are younger, more likely to be married, and were in treatment for a shorter period of time. These variables that are associated with high rates of fertility are counterposed by the fact that the females are more likely to be from higher socioeconomic classes (Myers et al., 1964,1965; Bean et al., 1964). Despite these differences the 1950 fertility level of the discharged females did not differ significantly from the fertility of the females who had died in treatment or were still in treatment on June 1, 1960. The 1950 fertility level of the discharged patients was 1.47 children per woman, and the average for the nondischarged females was 1.37. An important question ds whether the fertility of the patients who had died or were still in treatment in 1960 is different from the fertility of the general population, but no answer to that question can be given here because of the lack of an adequate control group and the lack of necessary comparable information in published statistics for the general population. The analysis in this paper is therefore restricted to the discharged patient and their controls (Table 1).
FINDINGS
Few of the 42 single females contribute to the total fertility rate. Two of the unmarried controls each have one child, and two of the unmarried patients each have two children. Disregarding the single females and their illegitimate births, it is found, as indicated in Table 2, that the fertility of ever-married female former patients differs very little from

While no significant fertility difference is found between ever-married patients and controls, it is of interest to consider what factors other than mental illness might have influenced the fertility of the patients but not of the controls. Two factors may be operating: first, the length of exposure to risk of conception; and second, the ability of the female to carry a pregnancy to full term.
Exposure to Risk of Conception
In evaluating the possible effect of the first factor, the differential exposure to risk of conception, several measures dealing -with exposure to risk are examined. First, exposure to risk varies by marital status. However, marital status differences that have been found to account for the low fertility of certain diagnostic groups (Book, 1959; Goldfarb and Erlenmeyer-Kimling, 1962) have been controlled in this study by matching patients and controls. Next, exposure to risk within marriage has been examined in two ways. First, a comparison of age of first marriage for the evermarried females indicates little difference between patients and controls. The median age at marriage is 21 years for patients and 21 years 3 months for controls.
A further examination of the possible influence of lowered exposure to risk among the patients is made by breaking down the patients and their matched controls according to the 1950 treatment agency of the patients. One group consists of those treated in hospitals and the other of those treated in clinics not separated from the family because of treatment. The average number of children, as indicated in Table 3 varies little among these groups. Ever-married females treated in hospitals and thus separated for some period from the house-

hold have a slightly lower fertility level than their controls, 2.63 vs. 2.73; and the clinic patients have a slightly higher fertility than their controls, 2.61 vs. 2.42. These differences are not statistically significant, however.
As a final check of the influence of possible reduction of exposure to risk of conception due to all factors--marital status differences, age of marriage, and separation due to treatment--a simple index of exposure to risk was computed for patients and controls., This index is simply an average percentage of the amount of time between the ages of 15 and 49 years of age when the subject was married and living with a husband. For the patients, on the average, 59% of the risk period was spent living with a husband; for the controls 65% of the risk period was spent in a viable marital union. In years this difference means that the controls have spent, on the average, only 2.1 years more than have the patients in a viable marital union, which may account for the slightly higher fertility rate of the controls (Table 2). This difference in exposure to risk is due primarily to the time spent in hospital treatment by female patients.

Ability to Carry Pregnancy to Full Term
The second major factor that may have reduced the effective fertility of the patients is the inability of the patient to carry a pregnancy to full term. To

determine whether the fertility of the patients is reduced significantly by a high proportion of miscarriages or abortions, the patients and controls were compared with respect to the total number of pregnancies not carried to full term. No differences are found between the patients and their controls. Twentysix per cent of the patients (26.7%) and controls (26.1%) report one or more abortions. The number ranges from one to four for the controls and from one to five for the patients.
DISCUSSION
The findings presented in this paper of no significant differences in the fertility experience of a group of former psychiatric patients and a matched nonpatient group supports previous research. The study reported in this paper deals with patients from a variety of diagnostic groups who are no longer in psychiatric treatment, whereas most other studies have dealt with patients from a single diagnostic group who are in treatment. Although this study is not, therefore, strictly comparable with previous research, the high degree of consistency suggests that the fertility of the mentally ill is a function of those social structural variables associated with fertility differences in a nonpatient population.
Once the influences of age, marital status, race, religion, and social class are eliminated, no significant differences are found in the comparison of the female patients with their never-treated matched controls. In those cases where the patient is exposed to risk of conception within a viable marital union, the patient-control fertility differences are minor. The evidence suggests that the patient fertility level is not significantly reduced due to prolonged marital separation due to treatment; later marriage,

if marriage occurs; or reduced ability to carry a pregnancy to full term. Although the former hospital patients averaged 4 years and 8 months of inpatient treatment and experienced, on the average, 2.1 years less .exposure to risk in a viable marital union between the ages 15 to 49, separations due to inpatient treatment most frequently occurred after the ages during which most childbearing takes place.
If the total contribution of the mentally ill to the gene pool of the population is lower than their distribution in the population would suggest, this reduction may be found among the patients who are more likely to remain in treatment or die in treatment, or it may be due to the lowered rate of marriage among patients. In this study it has not been possible to evaluate properly the fertility experience of the patients from the original New Haven census who died in treatment or were still in treatment by June 1, 1960, because of the lack of an adequate control group. However, it is interesting to note that a comparison of the 1950 fertility level of the discharged patients with the 1950 fertility level of the patients who died or were still in treatment in 1960 indicates no significant difference--1.47 vs. 1.37 children per woman, respectively. Furthermore, previous studies of patients in treatment indicate that the fertility level of such patients is similar to that of nonpatient populations of similar age and marital status. The lowered marriage rate that seems to account for patientnonpatient fertility differences in other studies has been controlled in this study by matching patients and controls on marital status as well as on other variables. The potential importance of the variable of marital status, however, is reflected in the fact that 25.6% of our pa-

dents in 1960 were still single (Table 1). Future studies dealing with the psy-
chologic dimension of differential fertility will need to consider both patients in treatment and those who are able to return to the community. The success of such studies requires, however, the development of an appropriate methodology encompassing an adequate control group to evaluate efficiently the effect of mental illness and its treatment on the risk of conception and actual fertility experience. Such studies are needed because the understanding of the genetic composition of the population requires increased knowledge of the psychologic as well as the sociodemographic aspects of differential fertility.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The fertility experience of 164 female patients who were in psychiatric treatment in 1950 but who on June 1, 1960, were discharged and living in the community is compared with the fertility experience of a control group of nevertreated females matched individually on six sociodemographic variables. The contribution to the reproduction rate of the 42 unmarried patients and controls was negligible. The fertility levels of the ever-married patients and controls were approximately the same--2.58 children vs. 2.64 children, respectively. A number of variables that might have reduced the fertility rate of the ever-married females are suggested and examined; the analysis finds no significant differences when

the patients are compared with demographically similar nonpatients. These findings are consistent with previous studies of patients from single diagnostic groups and patients in treatment.
