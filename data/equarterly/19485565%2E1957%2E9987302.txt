DIFFERENTIAL FERTILITY BY DURATION OF MARRIAGE*

CHRISTOPHER TIETZE Department of State

Bureau of the Census

IN THE STUDY OF DIFFERENTIAL FERTILITY
demographers have relied either on comparatively simple measures of current fertility, such as marital fertility rates (1), or on the retrospective analysis of the accumulated fertility of cohorts. American scholars have generally used birth cohorts (2), while our British colleagues have preferred marriage cohorts (3).
Source of Data
Basic data for the United States are available from a number of official sources. Several years ago the Bureau of the Census published a volume on fertility by duration of marriage, with data for 1910 and 1940 for native white and Negro women by age, residence, education, and occupation of husbands (4). The fertility report of the 1950 Census contained data on fertility by duration of marriage for white

and nonwhite women, but only by age and
residence (5). At the request of the senior
author and with funds supplied by the
Population Council, the Census Bureau
has recently prepared, for 1950, special
tabulations by duration of marriage of a
one per cent national sample of women, 15
to 44 years old, married once and husband
present, by number of children ever born,
cross-classified by major occupation group
of husband and (separately) by years of
school completed by wife (6) .
The present paper utilizes these special
tabulations for white women married 10 to
14 years, a group corresponding closely to
the marriage cohorts of 1935-39. This par-
ticular duration was selected in order to
secure data on a group of marriages suffi-
ciently recent to reflect the habits of family
building of the war and early postwar
periods, and at the same time established
long enough to include the greater part of
their total fertility (7). The marriage co-
horts of 1935-39, however, have experienced
some initial reduction of fertility, due to
the postponement of first births. Nearly

7 This statement can be only partly supported by statistics. In the United States, native white women, 30 to 34 years old and married 10 to 14 years in 1940, had 2,280 children ever born per 1,000 women (adjusted) or 78 per cent of the 1950 rate, 2,937, for white women, 40 to 44 years old and married 20 years or more. In Great Britain, couples classified into eight social status categories, married in 1910, 1915, and 1920, had produced at 10 to 14 years duration of marriage between 94

One of the problems in comparing these census data concerns the different treatment in 1950 than in 1910 and 1940 of data for women for whom no report was made either on times married or on children ever born. The published 1950 census data included estimates of children ever born and of times married, when such information was not originally reported (9). The published 1910 and 1940 cumulative fertility rates were computed on the basis of reporting women. It is estimated that the 1940 rates should be reduced by 2.7 per cent, and the 1910 rates by about 2.0 per cent, to allow for the effect of excluding the relatively infertile women with no report (10). Since the proportion of

1940, information on duration of marriage was obtained in an office procedure, by subtraction of the woman's age at first marriage from her age at the census date. A woman married at, say, age 18 and who was 19 in 1940 was credited with a marriage duration of one year. Actually, if combinations of the extreme limits of age at marriage and at census were considered, the woman could have been married anywhere from one day to two years, a range centered at 1.0 years. In using data obtained by subtraction of whole years of age, it is conventionally assumed that the ends of the 2-year-range offset each other and yield the practical equivalent of data for single-year ranges, but with midpoints at anniversary dates such as 1.0 years rather than halfway

was higher than the rates for any major occupation group of employed men except farm laborers. This high rate is believed to reflect mainly the increased eligibility for public emergency work of persons with large families; husbands with small families were more likely to subsist on parttime work and were, therefore, classified as employed (13). For purposes of this paper, the wives of unemployed husbands were distributed among the occupation groups on the assumption that the percentage of unemployed in each occupation group of husbands was proportionate to the percentage among all males, 25 to 44 years old, according to the 1940 Census report on usual occupation (14). It was further assumed that the fertility of each group of wives of unemployed men was proportionate to the corresponding rate

A fifth problem, for which the data were likewise not adjusted, involves possible differences between 1910, 1940 and 1950 data in the completeness of reporting, when a report was made on children ever born. Comparison of entries on birth registration records of infants born in the first three months of 1950 with census data suggests the reporting of children ever born among white women of childbearing age is of excellent quality (15).
Because all of the data on fertility shown in this paper are based on samples of the population rather than on complete counts, cumulated fertility rates are not presented for the two smallest occupation groups for which data are customarily shown by the Bureau of the Census, i.e., service workers and farm laborers.

15 Data for aged women are not involved here. There is evidence that rates of children ever born for very old women tend to be too low, either because some children are not reported by the respondents or because the women are not representative of the larger group from which they have survived.
