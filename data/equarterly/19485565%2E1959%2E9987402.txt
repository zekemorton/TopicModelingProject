birth or early childhood form an important special population group for the evaluation of current mating and fertility patterns. In the present study, deafness has been defined as a "stressproducing hearing loss . . . making effective auditory contact with the world impossible and necessitating specialeducative efforts" (Kallmann, 1956). Persons so afflicted are forced by theii sensory deprivation into a state of semiisolation, a circumstance that is bound to affect their potentials for mate selec tion and reproductivity.
Limited in their cultural and social horizons, especially because of lack ot speech development, and shut off in varying degree from the hearing world, deaf persons form a society within a society. Out of choice or necessity, they join in groups that cut across many
*This report is the thirteenth in a series of publications on the Mental Health Project for the Literate Deaf, which is being conducted by the Department of Medical Genetics of the New York State Psychiatric Institute, Columbia University, aided by a grant from the Office of Vocational Rehabilitation of the U. S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. The report was presented as part of an international conference on "Differentiation in Current Mating and Fertility Trends" which was held by the American Eugenics Society at the New York Academy of Medicine on February 14, 1959.

boundaries, including those conventionally drawn for geographic, ethnic, cultural or socio-economic reasons (Kallmann and Rainer, 1958).
A number of special factors are tobe considered in studying the patterns oi marriage and parenthood among the deaf. For one thing, although a severe defect characterizes the members of the group, it usually does not interfere with their surviving into adulthood, participating in community life, marrying and having children. Deafness is distributed throughout the land, with a prevalence of about 0.1 per cent in the United States and similar rates in other countries (World Health Organization, 1953). Moreover, in about half the cases the condition is congenital, often apparently gene-borne (Sank and Kallmann, 1956). Whether the frequency of this type of deafness is increasing or dwindling is still undetermined.
Other cases of hearing loss may be precipitated by toxic or infectious influences in early life, although they also may be based on a genetic predisposing factor. In any case, while deafness following meningitis and other infections is decreasing, there are now "a greater number of children who are deaf as a result of diseases of congenital origin, such as the sequelae of Rh incompati-

bility, rubella and premature birth" (Fowler, 1958).
Mating and fertility studies of the deaf population may eventually yield sufficient data to throw light on any changing trend in its size, as well as on problems of the etiology, frequency and distribution of the defect. No matter how useful such research may be for present clinical and counseling purposes, its most valuable contribution would unquestionably be to help lessen the number of persons born deaf in the future.
When it comes to counseling deaf persons and their families, suggestions are usually directed toward securing optimum conditions for successful adaptation in all phases of life. Advice is sought on such matters as whether to marry and when, whether to choose a deaf or a hearing mate from a deaf or hearing family, how many children to plan on, or, having had a deaf child, whether to risk another, and the problem of divorce. The consequences of these decisions combined with other influencing factors, such as type of education, method of communication, and kind of sex instruction, will not only leave their mark on the next generation but will affect the health and happiness of the present one.
These factors are part and parcel of any broad mental health program. In considering any effective population policy it is necessary to take into account the welfare of the parents as well as that of prospective children, always with a view to preserving the family as the basic unit of society (Rainer, 1958b). These goals must certainly be envisioned for such special groups as the deaf, if there is to be any hope of their general attainability.

Curiously enough, in a century of considerable progress in the education of the deaf, there have been very few adequate studies on their mating and fertility patterns. A study by Fay in 1898 provided extensive data on 3078 marriages (Fay, 1898), and census figures for 1900, 1910 and 1920 are cited by Best
(Best, 1943; Dept. of Commerce 1928). Despite the need for current data that would reflect a modern psychiatric and genetic orientation, a search revealed no such information on the demographic and health characteristics of the deaf population.
In view of this lack, our pilot study was organized in New York State in 1955
(Kallmann, 1956). The data to be presented here grew out of this project, which encompasses the following general aims:
1. To investigate the adjustive norms and specific family problems of the literate deaf in two statistically representative deaf populations, the total deaf population of the State of New York, and all deaf twins in the eastern half of the United States.
2. To develop and apply improved methods for the psychiatric management of the specific problems of deaf adolescents and adults.
Research subjects for this study were ascertained with the aid of all available agencies, including schools, hospitals, statistical bureaus, and various cultural, social and vocational organizations. Without exception, these groups cooperated in our task of listing the name of every deaf person over the age of 10 in New York State. After almost two years' work, conducted in cities; towns and villages throughout the state, an index of over 12,000 names and addresses was built up.
Within this total frame, various samples were studied by different methods.

A random sample of 300 adults was interviewed at length to determine such qualitative data as sexual maturation patterns and attitudes regarding marriage and parenthood, problems of marital adjustment and maladjustment, the planning of family size and the nature of intra-family relationships. Also, life performance was evaluated in the community, at work, in clubs and associations.
Psychiatric patients, hospitalized or otherwise, were investigated clinically as to diagnosis, course and treatment (Altshuler and Rainer, 1958), and demographically as to the added effect of mental illness on family patterns of the deaf.
Because of the particular value of marriage and fertility data in the project, it was decided to secure this information for the entire group of deaf adults. As the first step in sampling this heterogeneous and often elusive population, a questionnaire was mailed out regarding date of birth and the presence or absence of twins or other deaf persons in the family. Over 20 per cent or about 1700 persons replied, far more than anticipated, very likely because of the innocuous nature of the "Are you a twin?" approach.
All those who answered and a 1:5 random sample of those who did not received a second questionnaire, two pages long, requesting more detailed information on marriage and parenthood. The data to be presented here are taken from the replies to this second questionnaire (about 1000) and constitute a first approximation to a properly weighted random sample of the entire frame (Deming, 1956). Those who did not reply will be followed up by a personal call or through cooperating schools, clubs, and leaders of the deaf.

119
Comparable data have been obtained on deaf patients in state mental hospitals to determine the combined effect of deafness and institutionalized mental illness, particularly schizophrenia, upon marriage and fertility. By contrast, a small but select number of deaf persons who have achieved professional or executive status furnishes significant information about this special group.
Since the tabulated data are supposed mainly to demonstrate the statistical procedures applied and to point out trends and hypotheses, tests of statistical significance have frequently been omitted. More detailed analyses, particularly from a genetic standpoint, have been postponed until such time as complete data will be available.
Figure 1 represents graphically by age and marital status the first group of 968 deaf persons to cooperate in the study. This diagram reveals that the base ol this pyramid is too narrow, most likely because of a deficit of replies from unmarried males and females in the two lowest age groups.
Tabulation of these cases according to present marital status (Table 1) yields a total marriage rate of 61 per cent for males, and of 61.5 per cent for females. The given figures are only slightly lower than those for the total New York State population (66.8 per cent for males, 62.9 per cent for females), but they reflect the previously discussed underrepresentation in the two lowest age groups. The disparity increases if only persons over 24 years of age are compared (66.7 and 78.8 per cent for married males, and 66.8 and 70.4 per cent for married females) .
Another interesting trend seems to be indicated by the finding that the current marriage rate of deaf persons (over 60

per cent in both sexes) is considerably higher than the onereported in 1920 for the total deaf population of the United States (36.1 per cent for males, 39.4 per cent for females). It is in accordance with expectation that in our present sample, the highest celibacy rates are found among hospitalized schizophrenics (82.3 and 61.4 per cent, respectively). While only 10.1 per cent of the males and 24.6 per cent of the females are married, an additional 5.1 per cent of the males and 10.5 per cent of the females are divorced.
Compared with the hearing population, the present deaf sample also shows

an apparently increased proportion of divorced persons. This finding may mean that either more deaf than hearing persons are divorcing, or that thosewho divorce find it harder to remarry. The latter explanation seems more plausible because of the relatively low figure for married deaf persons ever divorced, 5.9 and 9.1 per 100 married males and females, respectively.
A telling factor in determining the choices and family patterns of a deaf individual is the hearing status of his parents. Table 2 separates the responding deaf persons, male andfemale, into those with neither parent deaf, and those with

one or both parents deaf. It will be noted that about 94per cent of our sample are the offspring of two hearing parents, although some of them have deaf cases among siblings, children or other relatives. Obviously, while the deaf do not replace themselves, they do contribute to some extent to the recurrence of deafness in the next generation.

A similar conclusion is to be drawn from data on the children of the deaf.
Of particular interest is the high marriage rate of those deaf who have deaf parents. With both parents deaf, the marriage rates are 83.3 per cent and 94.7 per cent for the two sexes; with neither parent deaf, 65.9 per cent and 74.4 per cent, respectively. If this dif-

ference continues to prove significant, the trend may have negative selective value. It is not clear, however, how such an effect is mediated, through the advice or example of the parents, or through other circumstances in the parental home.
That a detailed genetic analysis will be needed at a later date is shown by the data summarized in Tables 3 and 4. At present, if all cases of deafness are used to compute the percentages of deaf siblings with and without a deaf parent from the total number of siblings avail-

able in the survey, there is a difference from 6 per cent to 19.4per cent according to whether the given sibships had no or at least one deaf parent (Table 3). The application of various corrective procedures in the final analysis (omission of siblings of isolated, adventitiously deaf subjects, expectancy rates by means of theWeinberg method, etc.) will probably confirm that themajority of genetically determined forms of early total deafness follow a recessive mode of inheritance. In any case, the data tabulated so far give some indication of the expectancy of deafness among the children of matings that have already produced one deaf child. Included in the present series are 96 sibships with 2 deaf subjects, 31with 3, 2 with 4, and5 with 5.
A tendency toward familial clustering is also revealed by an analysis according to family size (Table 4). Apparently, parents, particularly hearing parents, who have two deaf children, go on to have larger families than those with just one deaf child, perhaps in an attempt to compensate. If this hypothesis is correct, the trend maybe more pronounced than the table indicates, since the order of birth hasnotbeen taken into account.
In another setof tables, marriage rates for deaf females are combined with fertility rates expressed as children born per 100 mothers. Table 5 divides the group of 434 deaf women intofive-year age groups, including 225 women over 45 whose fertility period is considered completed. Because of the previously noted underrepresentation of unmarried persons in this group, the observed proportion of females who have ever been married (75.8per cent) is probably an overestimate. It is unlikely, however, that the final figure will be as lowas the one that prevailed in the earlier years

of the century, when it varied from 30.7 per cent in 1900 to45.6 per cent in 1920. The fertility rate for mothers also remains below the level of the general population, b u t relatively less so than in 1920. T h e current values are 211 children born per 100 deaf mothers, as compared to 235 among the hearing in the 1950 census.
In Table 6, the rates for the total group of deaf women are broken down into differential rates forthe three major religious affiliations and for residence areas as defined by the census. At this stage, the usefulness of these data lies mainly in further describing thecomposition of ourresponding group. Added to this table are the marriage and fertility figures for all schizophrenic deaf females in state hospitals. Once again, there is a lowmarriage rate (38.6 per cent), but a fertility rate of 211 per hundred mothers, comparable to the findings for deaf women generally.
Of crucial importance in this study is

the particular mating and fertility pattern determined by the presence or type of deafness in both marital partners. Table 7 combines thegiven data as related to assortative mating and ensuing productivity, and includes an estimate of the differential productivity of deaf children. Interestingly, deaf women married at a median age of 23 to 24, somewhat later than thegeneral population for which the median age is about 21. Only 4 per cent of the women who were born deaf and 13percent of those who became deaf early in life were married to hearing men. T h erest had husbands who were deaf since birth or early childhood.
In each mating group, fertility rates for mothers are lower than they were in 1898, reflecting the fertility decline in the general population. It should be remembered, however, that the marriage rate of the deaf has risen considerably, with consequent increase in the net fertility for all deaf. Incidentally, hear-

ing siblings ofourdeaf subjects havenot been used as"normal" controls for fertility, since there isreason for assuming that they themselves represent a selected group, both genetically and socially.
The last columns in Table 7 reveal that over 27 percent of the marriages where both partners were born deaf,and from 12percent to15percent ofthose where one partner was born deaf resulted in deaf children (in most cases, more than one). A significantly increased number ofdeaf children was also produced by persons who presumably became deaf during childhood. This group calls forfurther genetic investigation. In any event, thepresent data would seem to besufficient to demonstrate the operation ofassortative mating patterns in thedeaf, especially the proportionate contribution tothedeaf population byparents themselves born deaf.
The extent of this contribution, as shown in Table 8,is about 10percent of all children born to oursubjects.

These fertility figures, when compared with those of Fayin 1898,indicate a steady rate of production of newdeaf children. In other words, there is an increased reproduction of deaf children because of themuch higher marriage rate. Just aswith our findings in the deaf subjects' parents, the number of

This increase reflects the fact that most ofthechildren were born in the first half of their mothers' fertility period, before thedate of first admission at anaverage age of 32 years.

Finally, Table 11 summarizes thefirst results of a study of deaf persons who have achieved status educationally and vocationally that would be deemed outstanding in any population. Among the 22 cases investigated are dentists, chemists, engineers and research scientists,accountants, lawyers and business executives, artists and illustrators. All of them had hearing parents, and all the children are hearing. Except for those who were born deaf, age of onset of deafness was relatively high. With the median age at 7, at least half became deaf after they began to learn language and speech patterns. Of the 15 who married, almost half married hearing mates. No statement can as yet be made about general family patterns correlated with attainment in this special group.
Other subgroups which are still incomplete or otherwise unsuited for comparison with respect to marriage and fertility rates include 250 mentally defective deaf in state institutions, mostly unmarried; some deaf inmates inprisons; and a much larger number passing

through thelower courts, not infrequently suspected of homosexual acts.
It is expected that there will be some modification of the data presented here, when the less cooperative families are heard from. Needless to say, the difficulties in communicating with the deaf and obtaining their consent for intensive family investigation have complicated our work. Obviously, however, comprehensive studies of this kind form the basis for a realistic approach to family counseling, and to all psychiatric programs, not only for deaf people but for all groups who are handicapped to a similar extent.

DISCUSSION

W. EDWARDS DEMING*

The contribution of the statistician lies in the statistical design of surveys and in the interpretation of data derived from statistical surveys. The statistical design of a survey is characterized by the description of a sampling unit (person, household, segment of area), themethod of selection, the procedure by which to form theestimates, and the procedure by which to calculate an estimate of the margin of sampling variation for each estimate. The evaluation of reliability requires also detection and evaluation ofoperational blemishes in procedure, as well as consideration of the margin of sampling variation.
The aim in statistical design is to obtain the maximum amount of reliability that is possible within the limitations of allowable costs, interviewers' skills, and any other administrative restrictions. The aim in interpretation is to extract whatever objective information lies in the data for whateverpurposes experts in thesubject-matter may deem important; and to evaluate the reliability of the statistical information so extracted.

It is useful to think of three types ofuncertainties in data.
TYPE I. Uncertainties that are inherent in the questionnaire, or in the method of interviewing, orin the method of test. These are built-in deficiencies which one might describe briefly as missing the point, or getting information that is not needed for the purpose. They arise from imperfect knowledge of the subject-matter. They do not arise from flaws in carrying out the specified survey-procedure. A recanvass, for example, of areas, people, or households that have been selected for the sample will detect operational blemishes (Type II), but it will not detect built-in deficiencies. Another feature of Type I is that it is independent of the size of the sample. We do not reduce this type of uncertainty by increasing the size of the sample to a complete coverage.
TYPE II. Blemishes and blunders in carrying out the procedure specified. Going to testing, coding, computations, and other work. Nonresponse is an important example. These errors have their origin in imperfect workmanship, or in bad luck. One may detect them by a recanvass or by other con-
