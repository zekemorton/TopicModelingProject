children, in particular, those with many children. As the birth rate recovered in the 1940's and the threat of a declining population disappeared--at least for the near future--demographic considerations were naturally relegated somewhat to the background when the major part of the program was implemented.

The philosophy behind this policy is that the community is not primarily interested in more children but in desired children. Further, recourse to illegal abortions performed by unqualified persons constitutes a far greater danger to the life, health, and fecundity of women than does abortion performed by properly authorized medical authorities.

Principal Measures
Some examples will be given here of recent legislative measures in Scandinavia with an indication of the importance of demographic considerations in formulating them. Unlike the pro-natalist policies of certain countries such as France, no attempts have been made to suppress information on contraceptive practices or to limit such practices. On the contrary, information on the use of contraceptives is provided among other services at many state and municipal maternity health centers, and in Sweden pharmacists are required by law to sell contraceptive items.

As far as economic aid to the family is concerned, the notion of outright cash allowances was not favored in the earlier family welfare programs. It was felt that even if cash allowances might be more immediately effective in encouraging larger families, measures for equalizing the economic burden of childbearing and childrearing should preferably be given in the form of help in kind to make certain that mothers and children would benefit fully from them. However, this rather unqualified preference for help in kind has been abandoned in recent years when the major part of family welfare measures was im-

As far as abortion is concerned, rather plemented. The principal opinion has little importance is given to fighting in- been that for each segment of, and for each duced abortions by prosecution and severe specific need in, the program, the most

punishment. Efforts are being concentrated on eliminating as far as possible the economic and Bocial reasons which cause women to seek abortions. Thus, in all Scandinavian countries economic assistance is provided for expectant mothers, expenses for confinement services are low or non-existent, and centere have been established where expectant mothers can obtain advice and aid of various kinds. Of psychological importance is a Swedish law which prohibits the dismissal of a woman employee for reasons of pregnancy or childbirth. In addition, in all Scandinavian countries induced abortions can be performed legally where it can be demonstrated that childbirth constitutes a grave risk to the life or health of the mother. In Sweden and Denmark induced abortion may also be performed if justified on eugenic and criminal grounds or according to certain socio-medical considerations.

suitable form of assistance should be chosen and no over-all principle for or against help in cash should be applied.
As a result, a number of provisions covering benefits to families with children have been introduced or expanded to cover some of the needs of the family such as pre-natal and post-natal services, confinement services, economic and social and medical aid to the mother, daytime child welfare institutions, holiday travel for mothers and children, school meals, marriage loans, rent rebates and home-help services. However, at the same time it was realized that such assistance did not relieve the families of the economic burden of the costs of children to the extent which was considered desirable. Therefore, family allowances have been introduced as well, and today this is the basic scheme of equalizing the costs of children.

Nature and Magnitude of Family Allowances
Family allowances were introduced in all Scandinavian countries around 1947-50. The most comprehensive scheme is found in Sweden where all mothers receive a family allowance amounting to Kr. 290 annually for each child under 16 years of age. In Norway no allowances are granted for the first child in a family, but Kr. 240 annually is allowed for the second child, and Kr. 340 for each child thereafter. In Denmark, allowances amounting to Kr. 182 in Copenhagen and slightly less in provincial towns and rural areas are allotted for each child in low-income families. As the income of the family increases, the amount of the allowances is reduced according to a sliding scale.
Any discussion of the extent to which the family has been reimbursed for the economic costs of children would be incomplete without consideration of the tax deductions allowed for children. For many years the burden of childhood dependency has been somewhat reduced by allowing the families to make certain deductions in tax assessments on account of dependent children. However, as the income tax structure has become increasingly progressive, the deductions from gross taxable income allowed for each child have resulted in a system in which the net benefits of the deductions for the higher income families are far greater than for the middle income families, and the majority of low income families obtain no benefits at all as they pay little, if any, income tax. Therefore, tax relief in favor of dependent children was not an appropriate way to obtain the extent of equalization of the costs of rearing children desired.
In Sweden, the deficiency of the existing system of tax assessments was fully realized, and as a consequence deductions in taxable income on account of children were discontinued and family allowances were introduced at a rate equal for all. The great

majority of the families with children, and low income families in particular, gained substantially by the new scheme. In Norway and Denmark a combined system of family allowances and tax assessment in favor of families with children is in existence. The general idea underlying the Danish scheme of family allowances graduated by income was to make up for the stated deficiency in the system of tax assessment and to secure, as far as possible, the same total benefit of the combined scheme to all families. However, this has only been accomplished to a limited extent, and the well-to-do families still receive substantially higher total benefits than do low income families.
The extent to which family allowances and tax relief have reduced the economic burden of children depends of course upon the standard of living of the individual family. However, some indication may be obtained from the following example: On the basis of recent inquiries in Sweden and Norway on the extra costs of maintaining a child without reducing the standard of living, it is estimated that, for a family with three children aged 4, 7 and 10 years and the average income for industrial workers in urban areas, the family allowances cover 25 to 30 per cent of the "costs" of maintaining the children in Sweden; in Norway the family allowances and the tax relief combined cover 30 to 35 per cent of the costs. The proportion of extra costs of children covered by these schemes is generally higher in rural areas where the expenses of children for food and housing are somewhat lower.
Other measures than family allowances and tax relief are important for reducing the economic strain of children. For example, free school lunches are provided to all children in most urban areas and in certain rural areas in Sweden; in Denmark and Norway children in many urban areas are benefited by such programs. Moreover, considerable rent assistance is granted fam-

composition of existing marriages by duration of marriage has to be taken into account. For Sweden data are available on the annual number of births by duration of marriage and the number of married women of various durations of marriage. Table 2 presents for the years 1939-50 the average number of confinements1 per 100 married women at various durations of marriage. The sum of these durationspecific fertility rates for a given calendar year provides a measure of marital fertility of that year standardized for the effects of variations in the annual number of marriages over the last 25-30 years or more.
Similar data cannot be presented for Norway, as no year-by-year estimates are available on the number of women at various durations of marriage. However, approximately the same results can be obtained by relating the number of births to women at various durations to the number of marriages contracted in the year they were married. In Table 3 such rates are given per 100 marriages. It is obvious that the rates computed in this way will, ceteris paribus, tend to be somewhat lower than

the true duration-specific rates as no allowance is made for the fact that the number of existing marriages in cohorts of married women is gradually reduced by divorce and death. However, this factor is of only minor importance here as we are mainly concerned with the earlier years of marriage. Further, the divorce rates and mortality rates are rather low in Norway and do not change fundamentally from year to year. A direct comparison between the level of the fertility rates for the two countries should not be made (the rates for all women for Norway are too low by approximately 10 to 20 per 100 marriages), but in the present paper the main purpose is to study the recent trend in marital fertility within each country. Duration-specific fertility data for Denmark are not presented here as no data are available yet for the years following 1950 when family allowances were introduced in that country.
The annual sums of fertility rates specific for duration show that the recent decline in the birth rate is not just a corollary of a decreasing number of marriages. Similar to the trend in the crude birth rate, marital fertility expressed as the average number of births per marriage reached its peak in Sweden in 1944 and in Norway in 1946,

HVhereas in the Swedish fertility statistics, duration of marriage is stated in completed years of mar-
riage, the Norwegian data are tabulated by year o£ marriage (it is assumed that marriages taking place
in a given calendar year have an average duration of marriage of i/2 a year by the end of that year, of li/£ years by the end of the following year etc).

and has declined since then. In the case of Sweden marital fertility declined by about 18 per cent whereas the birth rate declined by about 25 per cent in the period 1944-50. In Norway, however, where the fall in the marriage rate has been much smaller and started somewhat later, the decline was around 18 per cent for both in the period 1946-50. Therefore, a considerable part of the decline in the birth rate in Sweden in recent years and most of that in Norway was due to a tendency toward lower fertility among persons married. There is no evidence of any appreciable change in the course of marital fertility due to the introduction of family allowances in Sweden early in 1948 and in Norway late in 1946.
A somewhat more complete analysis of the recent trend in marital fertility can be made by studying the annual growth in family size for women at various durations of marriage. For this purpose the fertility rates given in Tables 2 and 3 are accumulated for each cohort duration by duration (along the diagnonals in the tables) and

presented in Charts 1 and 2. It would be expected that favorable ef-
fects, if any, of family allowances would show up within a few years. Couples married for some years might expand their family size, with little delay, beyond that planned before family allowances were introduced; those married recently would tend to reduce the spacing of their children. However, no such "shock effect" appears to have materialized.
In Norway, the family size is lower in all post-war marriages than in 1941-45 cohorts at similar durations, in spite of the fact that economic conditions were more favorable in recent years than during and immediately after the war. The recent trend in the average family size at high durations is complicated by the fact that many of the cohorts at these durations in the post-war years are composed of women married in the years before and immediately after the outbreak of the war. These women avoided maternity to a considerable extent during the earlier years of their marriages because

of the unsteady economic conditions and the outbreak of the war. Later on they made up some but not all the births they had postponed. The introduction of family allowances does not seem to have had any effect in this respect as there seems to be no indication that the making-up of births in these cohorts was speeded up in recent years. The cohorts 1941-45 increased their families in a way which was surprisingly uniform during all post-war years. The fact that they achieved a considerably higher family size than the previous cohorts at a similar duration seems to be mainly due to the postponement of births on the part

of the latter cohorts rather to any favorable effects of family allowances upon the form' er cohorte.
In the case of Sweden the recent trend in fertility at high durations is similar to that of Norway. Within young marriages, however, the trend seems to have been different. The rather high level of fertility recorded in Sweden in the early years of marriage during the later war years and immediately after the war was fully maintained in recent years. This happened at the same time as a substantial decline took place in Norway as well as in many other countries, i.e., Denmark, England and Wales and the

cent trend in fertility gives on the whole rather little evidence of buoyant effects upon marital fertility owing to family allowances in Sweden and Norway. During the short period of time family allowances have been granted, marital fertility has with few exceptions continued its post-war decline. Thus, if the new scheme actually had some effect it was not generally sufficient to counteract the fertility decline. However, it is still possible that the decrease might have been even greater had the new schemes not been introduced. The rather stable level of fertility within young marriages in Sweden might be interpreted as an indication of favorable effects of family allowances, but it is too early to say whether this stability in fertility is of any significance as it might be due to changes in the timing of births within recent marriages rather than a tendency toward a check in the downward trend of completed family size. Caution is required in drawing definite conclusions with respect to the demographic effects of a single factor.
One may wonder whether the family allowances scheme should be considered a failure in view of the recent trend in fertility. Such a conclusion, however, would be erroneous. First of all, as pointed out above, the demographic effect was only one of several reasons for introducing the allowances. Further, besides the effect upon the birth rate, the allowances might have other demographic effects. Finally, the influence, if any, upon fertility was not expected to be revolutionary in view of the limitations of the schemes. Even if the family allowances have not had any effect upon the birth rate for the population as a whole, they might have had some effect upon fertility in certain groups of families.

The lack of recent data handicaps an investigation of this problem for the time being. The only attempt which could be made was an examination of the recent trend in the birth rate in Sweden within the counties with the lowest average income. The results showed that the trend in the birth rate for such counties differed little from that of the country as a whole. If anything, the birth rate seemed to have declined faster in recent years in these counties, but no precise conclusions could be drawn because the existence of a considerable out-migration modified the significance of the findings.
In the present paper only evidence of the demographic effect of family allowances has been discussed. However, several of the other measures in the program of population policy might also be considered from the point of view of their demographic effect. For some of them, such as the maternity and child welfare measures, there is clear evidence of depressing effects upon the stillbirth rate, maternal mortality, and infant and childhood mortality, but for others the effects are difficult to evaluate. In general, it seems likely that the program in its entirety rather than a single measure such as family allowances might have favorable effects upon fertility. Of importance in this respect is not merely the economic implications of the various measures upon the family budget but also the psychological effects engendered by the program. Particularly, the favorable attitude of the government and changes in the public opinion toward the family might have been major factors. A test of this hypothesis can hardly be made by a direct approach but would require a thorough study of the factors which influence fertility.
