A LONG TIME IT HAS BEEN BELIEVED
that human blood groups are neutral with respect to natural selection. During the past 15 years a number of papers have appeared indicating that the blood groups are subject to rather strong selection. Maternal-fetal incompatibility was first shown as a cause of fetal and neonatal deaths (Levine et ah, 1941; Levine, 1943; Waterhouse and Hogben, 1947). Indirect evidence for selection was presented from observation of the distribution of the gene frequencies in the world populations (Brues, 1954). Evidence has now been accumulating that there are real associations between the ABO blood groups and certain adult diseases. Moreover, we have found very recently evidence for selection operating at prezygotic stages (Matsunaga and Hiraizumi, in preparation). The purpose of this paper is to review some of the relevant recent findings, and to bring out evidence for prezygotic selection in ABO blood groups.

I . ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN ABO BLOOD
GROUPS AND DISEASES
The discovery of an association between gastric cancer and blood group A made by Aird et al. in 1953 has stimulated a search for such relations with a variety of diseases. Retrospective investigations based on a large number of hospital records have been carried out on a wide scale in various cities of different countries, and the frequencies of the ABO blood groups among patients affected with a given disease have been compared with a suitable control series. Statistical analyses of the data have now revealed that there is evidence for several associations (Roberts, 1959; Helmbold, 1960). Duodenal and gastric ulcers are commoner in persons of group O than in persons of group A, while those of group A are more likely to develop cancer of the stomach and of female genital organs than are persons of group O. Pernicious anemia and diabetes mellitus are both commoner in persons of group A than in persons of group O. However, there is no association between blood groups and other cancers such as

that of colon and rectum, lung and breasts.
Whatever may be the physiological mechanism underlying the reported associations, the selective effect can scarcely affect the genetic composition of the population, since it is obvious that only a small fraction of all individuals contract the disease and that in only some of them the fertility may be influenced. The situation would be different, if there were differential susceptibility among different blood groups to epidemic diseases. There are some reasons to suspect that the ABO blood groups may play a role in the resistance to certain infectious diseases, since some pathogenic micro-organisms are known to possess antigens similar to human bloodgroup substances (Table 1).
Of particular interest is the demonstration made by Pettenkofer (1960) that pasteurella pestis possesses an antigen similar to the H-antigen, while the variola virus has an antigen similar to the A-antigen. Based upon these findings, Vogel et al. (1960) have recently advanced the hypothesis that individuals belonging to different blood groups dis-

play different responses to pathogenic bacteria and viruses and this may be the major cause of the current geographical variations of the A, B and O genes. According to the hypothesis, patients of blood group O have had a very unfavorable prognosis with respect to infection with plague, because group O patients are not able to produce any antiH antibody which corresponds to the H-antigen of pasteurella pestis. Patients of A, B and AB groups whose H-antigen is less than in O-patients are able to produce anti-H antibody which may inhibit the propagation of the bacteria and thus may have enjoyed a selective advantage when infected with plague. In similar sense the resistance against smallpox is more effective in patients of blood groups B and O, who carry the anti-A in their serum, than in patients of blood groups A and AB who carry no such antibody. Those authors stated that certain geographical relationships can be observed between the distribution of the blood-group genes and the previous epidemics of plague or small-pox.
Although Vogel et al. are aware that their hypothesis is mostly speculative,

one important point may be discussed here. From serological and bacteriological considerations, the blood-group antigen found in certain bacteria and viruses is merely one fraction of the antigenic complex characterizing their biological properties. Using shigella dysenteriae which possessed certain bloodgroup antigens and later lost all of them by mutation in vitro, Iseki (1953) demonstrated that there was no association between toxin production and ability of producing the blood group antigens. Experiments made by the same author with other bacteria showed the same results, indicating that the virulence of the bacteria is not affected by whether or not they possess any blood group antigen. However, this does not necessarily mean that the pathogenicity of given bacteria expressed by complex interaction between host and parasite is completely independent of the blood groups of the host when infected by bacteria which possess the common antigen. The question is, whether such antigenantibody reaction as relating the blood groups can prevent the propagation of the invading bacteria, and if so, to what extent the clinical course of the patients will be influenced by such a selective process.
I I . ABO INCOMPATIBILITY AS A MAJOR
CAUSE OF PRENATAL AND PERINATAL
SELECTION.
Since the discovery by Levine et al. (1941) that hemolytic disease of the newborn is caused by maternal-fetal isoimmunization in Rh blood groups, a number of papers have appeared pointing out that not only hemolytic disease but also abortions and stillbirths can be

caused by ABO incompatibility between mother and fetus.
The recent two papers published by Chung and Morton (1961), and Chung, Matsunaga and Morton (1960) who anaylzed Caucasian and Japanese family data in respect to ABO blood groups by means of modern statistical methods, revealed some important clues to the understanding of the selective mechanisms operating through ABO incompatibility. First, it was clearly demonstrated that there is a significant reduction in fertility connected with ABO incompatibility in both Caucasian and Japanese data. The rate of elimination was estimated to be about 10 per cent of incompatible zygotes in Europe and America, while it varied from 3 to 21 per cent in Japan, the lower value obtained from a population living under more favorable environmental conditions. Secondly, it was shown that the overall effect of maternal-fetal incompatibility on mortality is the same whether the mother is of type O, A or B, despite the fact that the clinical observation of hemolytic disease of the newborn is almost restricted to children of O mothers. Thirdly, an interesting finding was revealed as to the effect of parity upon the segregation frequency of incompatible children. While Caucasian O mothers showed a highly significant decrease of incompatible children with parity, Japanese O mothers showed no parity effect. The frequency of incompatible children of A and B mothers is independent of parity, both from Caucasian and Japanese data. The deficiency of incompatible children in the absence of parity effect, is interpreted as due to differential mortality of incompatible fetuses and infants caused by normal or heteroimmune maternal antibodies, such as provoked by vaccines and bacterial antigens.

III. EVIDENCE FOR PREZYCOTIC SELECTION
IN ABO BLOOD GROUPS
We turn now to an entirely different aspect of the selective process, i.e., the possibilities of prezygotic selection. There may be three possibilities in selective mechanisms at prezygotic stages. The first one is the meiotic drive or unequal production of germ cells carrying different alleles in heterozygous parents. The second one is sperm competition which occurs independently of female genotypes. The third one is also a kind of sperm competition which may occur as a result of serological incompatibility between sperm carrying A or B gene and the anti-A or anti-B antibody found in the cervical secretion (Gullbring, 1957; Gerschowitz et al., 1958), the genetic result being similar to that caused by maternal-fetal incompatibility, except that gametic selection would bring about no zygotic loss.
Although a distinction cannot be made at present between the first two possibilities, it is possible to test whether or not prezygotic selection is operating to an appreciable extent. For this purpose, my collaborator Dr. Y. Hiraizumi has recently introduced a concept which may be called "family size equivalent" for children of a given genotype. The family size equivalent for O children of O X O matings is of course the mean number of observed children from such matings. The corresponding value for 9 O X S A matings may be calculated by the following formula:

9 OX ÓA)=mX-

1
X

where m is the observed number of O children from 5 O X Ó A matings.n is the observed number of such matings, and Po is the probability that an O child will be produced in such matings. This

value expresses the mean number of children if sperm carrying A gene in AO fathers were all eliminated and only sperm carrying O gene participated in the fertilization. If there were no sperm selection, the difference
A = 0 ^ ( 9 OX S A)-Oe,,(OxO) would be equal to zero, but if there were selection, say for O-sperm and against A-sperm, then the value A would be larger than zero. It is important to realize that zygotic selection would not affect the value A. since the two corresponding figures are calculated respectively for O children of O mothers. A comparison between the O^ ( 9 O X S B) and the O^ (O X O) will serve as a test for prezygotic selection in BO fathers. Many other instances in which the genotypes of mothers and children are constant but only fathers' genotypes differ can be used to test the hypothesis that prezygotic selection occurs in males, the null hypothesis being that the value A is equal to zero.
In order to check the above hypothesis, Japanese family data published during the period from 1932 to 1944 were used. They comprise eight papers, making 2243 families with 5336 children in all. The data of each paper were pooled together, since there was no heterogeneity in the distributions of blood groups among the parents. As the gene frequencies, we have used the summary of Kobayashi (1940) based on the data of more than a half million of Japanese, which give p = 0.2773, q = 0.1705, r = 0.5522 for A, B and O, respectively. There were no significant differences in the distribution of blood groups between our pooled data and those given by Kobayashi (x23 = 5.02, 0.50 > P > 0.10). The bias which obviously derives from the fact that the family data do not include any childless marriages, was removed by

making a correction on the number of each mating, based on other data (Matsunaga and Itoh, 1958; Haga, 1959) which provide the proportions of childless marriages in different matings.
The results are summarized in Table 2. For the purpose of testing our hypothesis, there are 18 pairs of mating types between which the family size equivalents can be compared respectively. For reasons mentioned below, results of eight pairs were shown separately from those concerning the remaining ten pairs. As is seen from the table, the values A were calculated to be positive in all 16 cases but two. The mean A differs nearly significantly from zero for the eight

pairs (A = + 0.214 ± 0.082, 0.05 > P > 0.01); the deviation is significant both for the remaining ten pairs (A = + 0.527 ± 0.123, P < 0.01) and for all18 pairs (A = + 0.350 ± 0.078, P < 0.01). The results strongly support our hypothesis that prezygotic selection is occurring for O-sperm. From our data, the ratio of O-sperm in thegerm cells of AO and BO fathers were estimated to be 0.545 and 0.546, respectively. It is interesting to see that the two figures are almost identical.
The above view might be opposed by the argument that reproductive compensation concurring with the effect of maternal-fetal incompatibility could produce similar results. Such compensation,

if any, would give rise to the bias only when the comparisons of the family size equivalents were made between incompatible versus compatible matings. Since the deviations remain significant when the comparisons are made betweencompatible versus compatible or incompatible versus incompatible matings (Table 2-B), such a possibility may be excluded.
Among the three possibilities inprezygotic selection mentioned above, sperm incompatibility would contribute tothe deviations in the first eight pairs, but not to the deviations found in the remaining ten pairs. Although this cannot be excluded, our data strongly indicate that the prezygotic selection in males is mostly due to either meiotic drive or sperm competition which occurs independently of theenvironment in female body.
At this point, a question may arise whether or not prezygotic selection is occurring in females. This may be checked by comparing the family size equivalents of a pair of mating types, in which fathers' genotypes are identical but mothers' genotypes differ. It was shown that the results are not consistent with thehypothesis that prezygotic selection occurs in females. However, the interpretation seems much more difficult than in the cases of prezygotic selection in males, because it ispossible that other factors such as differential fertility in mother's genotype, maternal effect upon zygotic viability, maybe involved.
IV. SELECTION FOR HETEROZYGOTES IN ABO
BLOOD GROUPS
The action of selection due to maternal-fetal incompatibility is directed against incompatible hÈtÈrozygotes. Prezygotic selection for O-sperm will of course work considerably toward increasing the frequency of gene O. It is considered that other selective forces must

be operating in order to compensate for the losses of the incompatible hÈtÈrozygotes or the losses of A and Bgenes.
We could look for a conceivable mechanism maintaining the balanced polymorphism in the advantage of hÈtÈrozygotes over both homozygotes. There is evidence that the relative viability of compatible hÈtÈrozygotes might be better than that of homozygotes. At the Symposium on Medical Genetics held in Madison (Wisconsin) in 1958, I presented Japenese family data on 33 matings of AB X ABwhich showed a significant excess of AB children. Since then, additional data on 16 such matings have been available. Because the new data, when pooled, do not differ significantly from the previous data with respect to the distribution of AA, BB and AB children (x22 = 2.73, 0.30 > P > 0.20), both data have been added together (Table 3). The observed ratio of AA, BB and AB children differ highly significantly from the expected ratio of 1:1:2 (x\ = 11.2, P < 0.001). Thedeviation is apparently due to the excess of AB and shortage of AA children, while the frequency of BB shows no disturbance. This suggests that the compatible AB zygotes may enjoy

42 Matsunaga

some selective advantages. Another evidence has been provided
by the recent paper by Chung and Morton (1961). Applying the method of segregation analysis to Caucasian family data, they demonstrated a significant excess of hÈtÈrozygotes in compatible matings, increasing with parity. Japanese segregation data (Chung, Matsunaga and Morton, 1960) were also consistent with those from Caucasian families. The excess of compatible hÈtÈrozygotes is not reflected in fetal death histories, and may therefore occur in early zygotic stages.
V. SELECTION IN MN BLOOD CROUPS
As for the selective mechanism involved in MN blood groups, little has yet been known as compared with ABO blood groups. However, there is evidence that the MN polymorphism is maintained owing to the advantage of hÈtÈrozygotes. I would like to point out only one important finding reported in the recent paper by Morton and Chung (1959), in which Caucasian family data on MN blood groups were scrutinized by means of segregation analysis. It was demonstrated that there is a highly significant excess of MN children in backand inter-crosses, indicating the advantage of hÈtÈrozygotes and probably limited to the children of MN mothers. A subsequent study on Japanese material (Chung, Matsunaga and Morton, 1961) has supported the evidence from Caucasian data that the MN excess cannot be explained by technical errors. Selection intensities estimated from the data would produce the observed genotype frequencies at equilibrium. The question, whether there is any association between MN blood groups and fertility or mortality, remains to be solved.

VI. CONCLUSIONS
There are a number of evidences from diverse sources which indicate that ABO blood groups are subject to natural selection at various developmental stages. From the evidences presented, it may be concluded that the principal mechanism which maintains the ABO blood group acts during prenatal and perinatal periods, probably in addition to prezygotic stages. Even though the reported associations between ABO blood groups and adult diseases are real, the effective result seems to be small. Implication of the plausible associations between the blood groups and certain epidemic diseases remains speculative until the extent of such selection, if any, can actually be known. The MN polymorphism is probably maintained by the advantage of hÈtÈrozygotes, apparently limited to MN mothers. Further investigations are needed in order to see whether MN blood groups have a direct relation to mortality or fertility.
