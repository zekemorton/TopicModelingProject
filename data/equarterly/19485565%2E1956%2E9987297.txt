I. REPORTED ILLEGITIMATE BIRTHS IN FLORIDA
1917-1953

T,HE BUREAU OF VITAL STATISTICS of The
Florida State Board of Health has collected illegitimacy statistics in conjunction with the recording of births since the inception of the bureau in 1917. This paper will present a statistical analysis of several aspects of these data.
Source of Data
Information concerning legitimacy is supplied by the mother to the doctor, midwife or other person attending the birth and is subject to an uncertain degree of misrepresentation. There is probably considerable concealment of the true facts by unwed mothers and some by the attendants as well. Bias introduced into the data by this factor and other limitations of the data will be discussed in subsequent paragraphs. Since 1949, legitimacy information has been placed on a confidential section of the original birth record which is not photographed when certified photostatic copies of the certificates are issued. It is believed that this confidentiality materially strengthens the accuracy of the reporting of this item.
Statistics on reported births and legitimacy for selected years are presented in table I.

Statistical Measures
Changes in reported illegitimacy over time may be appraised by the use of several statistical measures:
1. The trend of the absolute number of illegitimate births.
2. The trend of the illegitimate birth rate.
3. The trend of the illegitimacy ratio. 4. The trend of the specific illegitimacy
rate.
Illegitimate Births
1. The number of illegitimate births, both white and non white, has exhibited a steady upward trend over the years. In terms of work for social welfare agencies concerned with the problems of unwed mothers and their offspring, this has meant an ever increasing case load in this field in addition to increased work resulting from other growing social problems. In view of the rapid growth of Florida's population this trend may be expected to continue, and further increases in the need for the services of these organizations in this field may be anticipated.

births by race in relation to population as indicated by the crude illegitimate birth rates are shown in chart I. These rates have been plotted on a semi-logarithmic (ratio) scale and indicate the relative change in each rate from year to year. In all years, the non white illegitimacy rates exceed the white. The disparity undoubtedly reflects a true differential in the relative number of illegitimate births in each population group. However, since there is certainly some concealment of illegitimacy by members of both races, neither rate may be taken as indicative of the absolute extent of illegitimacy. It is probable that some of the difference in rates by race results from a greater degree of concealment on the part of unwed white mothers. Sam Shapiro in his study of illegitimacy in the United States for the period 1938 to 1947 has attributed part of the difference in rates to the greater ability (economic or otherwise) of the white mothers to leave their home community before the birth of the child and thus conceal the fact of illegitimacy.
The differing attitudes of the two racial groups toward illegitimacy are probably

also important factors in the degree of concealment by each race, as well as the principal factor in the true differential of the rates. An illegitimate birth does not stigmatize a child in the southern Negro community as it does in white society. The informal living together of man and woman is more common in the Negro than in the white group in the South. The failure to formalize a marriage does not, in many Negro communities, lower the social positions of the parties concerned, and this too tends to increase the reported illegitimacy rates among Negroes.
As indicated by chart I, rises and falls in the white birth rate tend to be accompanied by similar rises and falls in the white illegitimate birth rate. An exception to this is the period of World War II when the illegitimate white rate dipped sharply, possibly under the stimulus of allotments for the legitimate dependents of service personnel.
The non white illegitimate rate curve follows the general shape of the non white birth rate curve, but exhibits a somewhat sharper rate of increase.
It would appear that those social and

economic forces which effect changes in the legitimate birth rate also affect the number of illegitimate births.
The Illegitimacy Ratio 3. Although the levels of legitimate and illegitimate births are definitely interrelated, illegitimacy as a distinct problem may be measured by use of the illegitimacy ratio: the number of illegitimate births per 1,000 births. The ratios for the white and non white races for selected years are

presented in table I and are also indicated by the relative size of the gap between the trend lines of the birth rates and the illegitimate birth rates in chart I.
Over the long period from 1917 to 1953 the trend of the illegitimacy ratio has been generally upward for both races. However, this trend must be interpreted with caution. During this period, and especially during the years of World War II and after, there has been a considerable improvement in the completeness of the reporting of births

222 Eugenics Quarterly

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 06:37 07 December 2015

in Florida. This change may account for some of the increase in the ratio. Studies conducted in conjunction with the 1950 census indicate that in Florida the registration of white births was 98.8 percent complete in that year compared to 91.3 percent in 1940. The registration of non white births was 94.1 percent complete in 1950 and only 86.4 percent complete in 1940. There is a distinct possibility that the increase in completeness of registration has resulted to a great extent from the increased registration of illegitimate births.

Characteristics of Illegitimate Births
In addition to trend figures, comparative data for legitimate and illegitimate births for age of mother, birth order and attendant at birth are available for 1953.

Some of the increase may also have resulted from the raising of standards for the acceptance of certificates by the Bureau of Vital Statistics. This raising of standards has made the concealment of illegitimacy more difficult.
Another factor affecting the illegitimate birth rate is the increased interest in recent years of social welfare agencies in aiding unwed mothers and their offspring, and in the placement of children for adoption. The interest of these agencies and the adoption courts has required the keeping of more accurate records.
In the post war period beginning in 1945 the white illegitimacy ratio dropped from a level of 17.1 to a low of 16.2 in 1947 and has risen steadily from that point to the present figure of 19.1. The non white ratio was 182.5 in 1945, and has increased each year to the 1953 level of 248.8, an increase of 36.3 percent.
The Specific Illegitimacy Rate
4. The upward trend of illegitimacy is further emphasized by the specific illegitimate birth rates presented below. The specific illegitimate birth rate has as its base the number of unmarried women in the child bearing ages, 15 through 44.

Age of Mother
The distributions of the age of mother for legitimate and illegitimate births by race, and illegitimacy ratios by age are presented in table II. In general, illegitimacy ratios are higher at younger ages. The mothers of illegitimate children were a younger group than the mothers of legitimate children. The age distribution of non white mothers of both legitimate and illegitimate children shows a higher concentration in the age group 15 to 19 when compared %vith the corresponding white group.
Birth Order
The distributions of legitimate and illigitimate births by birth order, and of illegitimacy ratios by birth order are presented in table III. Illegitimate births for both races were generally of a lower order than legitimate births. White births, both legitimate and illegitimate, tend to be concentrated in earlier birth orders when compared with the corresponding group in the non white race. Illegitimacy ratios are distinctly higher for first order births for both races.
Attendant at Birth

Despite the factors indicating improved reporting of illegitimacy, an upward trend of the magnitude indicated by the specific rates and the illegitimacy ratio must be regarded as real increase in illegitimacy.

A small number of illegitimate white births (24) was attended by midwives. This figure represented 2.2 per cent of the total of illegitimate white births and compares with 1.1 per cent for the legitimate white

births. Higher percentages of non white births, both legitimate and illegitimate, were attended by midwives. The legitimate non white percentage was 31.9 and the illegitimate 37.7.
Summary and Conclusions
1. The trend of illegitimacy in Florida as indicated by various statistical measuring devices has been generally upward, especially in recent years.
2. The rate of illegitimacy is greater in the non white race.
3. Reported illegitimate births may be expected to grow in number because of

the upward trend of population. A continuance of the present rising trend of the illegitimate birth rates and ratios will intensify the growth.
4. Young mothers giving birth to their first child account for the largest proportion of illegitimate births.
5. There appears to be no important difference in the attendant chosen by mothers giving birth to legitimate offspring and the attendants at illegitimate births.

In the foregoing well-balanced statistical

analysis of reported illegitimate rates in Florida, W i l l i a m s and T h o m e r have stressed the fact that the increase in the rate of illegitimacy and the difference between the white and non white rates is probably more apparent than real. The purpose of this section is to discuss further this and other aspects of illegitimacy.
The illegitimacy ratios for the United States as estimated by Sam Shapiro of the National Office of Vital Statistics for 19381947 are generally comparable to those for Florida for the same period. In other words, about four births in 100 each year in the United States are illegitimate. Of these, something less than two in 100 are white and 17 in 100 are non white. For the ten-year period 1938-1947, about twothirds of a million illegitimate children were born in the United States; and because of the increase in the population, more than a million will be born in the subsequent decade. The similarity of the national and the Florida figures in recent years indicates that the increased Florida ratio of illegitimate to legitimate births may reflect primarily a more effective system of reporting and only secondarily an actual increase in the rates. The recent stability of the national figures suggests that the conditions producing illegitimacy are also relatively constant. Although only some of the factors influencing illegitimacy are known, they and others to be revealed by further study must be viewed in a complex of legal, psychological, and sociological terms.
Illegitimacy is legally defined in terms of marriage since it means the birth out of wedlock of a child. Generally speaking, legitimacy and illegitimacy differ in that between the illegitimate child and its mother only there exists the legal status of parent and child which in a legitimate birth exists between the child and both parents.
That there are in Florida two ways of legally entering marriage, either by statutory or by common law procedure, materially influences the illegitimacy rates. With certain exceptions, a statutory mar-

riage is established through a legally prescribed procedure of license, blood test, wedding ceremony, and cohabitation. A record of this marriage is filed in the county in which the ceremony is performed and a copy is sent to the Bureau of Vital Statistics, Florida State Board of Health. A common law marriage is created by a couple living together and being recognized as man and wife by others in the community. A common law marriage is just as legally binding as a statutory marriage, which means among other things, that it cannot be dissolved except by death or divorce, and that the children are legitimate. From the standpoint of the individuals concerned, the major drawback of a common law marriage is that there is no legal record of it such as in a statutory marriage, and should any legal question concerning it arise, such as inheritance or the legitimacy of the children, its existence must be proved by other means.
It seems true that many couples, though probably considerably more Negroes than whites, do not realize that they have established a common law marriage. Hence, children born of these unions are reported illegitimate when legally they are legitimate. If these births were correctly recorded, the illegitimate rates for whites and especially non whites would decrease and the difference between the two would be less. It should be noted, however, that for this same reason there are some births which are reported legitimate when in fact they are illegitimate. This situation arises both from the ignorance of the existence of a common law marriage, as just described, and from the false notion that a common law marriage is dissolved by separation of the partners, the so-called "common law divorce." In some of these instances a person will subsequently enter into a statutory marriage with another person without having a previous common law marriage (which they may have created wittingly or unwittingly) dissolved by death or divorce. In these cases the second marriage which

225

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 06:37 07 December 2015

the individual considers to be the legal marriage is void, the person involved in the two marriages is guilty of bigamy, and the children born of the second union are illegitimate even though the other spouse may not have been previously married and was ignorant of the other's status.
Although the status of illegitimacy usually carries a degree of social stigma for child and mother, public opinion seems considerably more lenient today than a generation or two ago. Some problems of illegitimacy have been slightly alleviated in certain states by legal enactments. About one-third of the states have eliminated the question of legitimacy from the birth certificate or placed it on a confidential section of the record as is done in Florida.
Two states, Arizona and North Dakota, have attempted to grant equal rights to all children by enacting laws declaring that every child is the legitimate offspring of its natural parents. Although these laws presumably give to the child born out of wedlock more legal status, such as the right to support and to inherit from the father as well as the mother, most of the conditions of what would be illegitimacy in other states remain because the child is not born within a marriage unit. All states except Texas and Virginia have laws which may require a father to support fully or partially his illegitimate child, but it must be remembered it is usually difficult to prove paternity in these bastardy proceedings. The Florida law provides, for example, that the father pay attorney fees, hospital and medical expenses, and allowance for the upkeep of the child, the amount of which is set by the court.
Although there is a widespread belief to the contrary, a man cannot be forced legally to marry a woman because of paternity or of any other reason because this action would be duress and it would violate the basic legal concept of marriage which rests upon the mutual consent freely given of the couple concerned.
The extent to which illegitimacy is a

social problem varies considerably. Among many Negro groups in the South, as was mentioned in the other section of this paper, and among some whites, an out of wedlock birth carries no social stigma for mother or child, and it creates no particular emotional disorders for them. In fact, in many instances the Negro mother has no desire to marry even though the father may have asked her, because it would mean for her the giving up of a much cherished independence. Sometimes, however, the financial problem of caring for the child may become great or even unbearable particularly with the growing up of the child or with the addition of other children. On the other hand, in the birth of an illegitimate child into a middle class, southern white family, the financial difficulties may be quite incidental, but the social stigma may be enormous and the emotional crisis may be shattering. There is intended here no implication that one of these problems is solely typical of one, but not the other group, but rather that one is more characteristic of one than the other. Emotional problems of illegitimacy for the Negro family and financial ones for the white are often quite traumatic.
Most case studies and statistical analyses, including those for Florida (table II) and for the United States, reveal that on the average unmarried, as compared to married, mothers of both white and non white races are younger and less well educated, and more come from the lower social classes. More recent studies strongly suggest that these differences are probably more apparent than real because unwed mothers of the middle and upper class are more able to hide the birth of an illegitimate child by having it delivered away from home under secret or at least very discreet conditions. This conclusion is borne out in the findings of Clark Vincent in a comparative study of unwed mothers in California whose children were delivered in private practice and of those whose children were born in a Salvation Army hos-

pital. Of the mothers who were delivered in private practice as compared with those who were delivered in the charity hospital, more were 22 years of age or older and fewer were 17 years, of age or younger; more of their alleged sexual partners were 26 years of age or older; more had attended college and fewer had not completed high school. He also found that the higher the educational attainment of the unwed mother, the more likely that she came from out of state to have her baby. Little is known about the fathers of illegitimate children. The study of Ruth Reed suggests that they may be older and of a higher educational level than the mothers, and by implication of a higher social class.
The explanations of why a girl or woman has an illegitimate child have varied according to our moral beliefs and our scientific knowledge of human behavior. Traditionally it was taken for granted that women had an illegitimate child because they had sinned and they were paying for their sins. Only in the more flagrantly exceptional case was there expressed a more charitable attitude that a young maiden had been seduced, wronged, and, of course, "ruined" even though a helpless innocent. With the modern development of the studies of human behavior explanations of illegitimacy have been sought in social and psychological terms. Studies made a quarter of a century ago stressed immorality, mental deficiency,poverty, slums and broken homes, whereas those made recently are concerned with cultural patterns and psychological processes.
Leontine Young emphasizes in her provocative analysis of over thirteen hundred case histories of illegitimate births that a basic error which had been made prior to the acceptance of Freudian and other modern concepts of human behavior as purposive was that the out of wedlock baby was considered merely an unwanted and accidental by-product of the mother's sexual conduct when in fact it seems that in most cases having the child is the real,

though unrecognized, motive. She develops the thesis with voluminous illustrations that most, but not all, girls having illegitimate children subconsciously want the out of wedlock child because of deep-seated psychological needs, although they are completely unaware of these desires at the conscious level and they are shocked, terrified, or surprised over what has happened to them. Young believes that the two major groups of girls in this category are those who are completely dependent upon a domineering mother and those who are in revolt against an excessively authoritarian father. The mother-ridden girls seem to be motivated by feelings of both love for and revenge against their own mothers, and they often want their mothers to adopt the child. The father-ridden appear to act from hatred against their fathers and often against all men, and they usually express violent hate and jealousy of their own father and the father of their chid.
Much illegitimacy is, of course, not of this unconsciously motivated type. Among many Negro and some white groups, for example, pregnancy and childbirth are naturally expected conditions of life whether in or outside marriage. Then, too, many out of wedlock children are definitely not desired, and they are the result of emotional misadventure and failure of contraception.
It appears that a considerable number of illegitimate children are reared within the maternal family either by the mother or by the mother's mother, and the remainder, probably a minority among non whites and a majority among whites, are given by adoption through a social agency to an unknown outsider. Although illegitimacy is certainly "a social problem" with its concomitants of heartaches and headaches for most of those involved, there is a silver lining even to this dark cloud. In the first place, an illegitimate child is sometimes a source of greater joy than sorrow to its mother and her family. Even more significant is the fact that illegitimate
