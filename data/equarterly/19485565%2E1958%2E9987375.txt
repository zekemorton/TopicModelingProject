JLN A PREVIOUS INVESTIGATION in Puerto Rico we found that Catholics were usually indistinguishable from non-Catholics in attitudes and practices regarding fertility control.1 Indeed, where differences appeared, Catholics were almost invariably more liberal than non-Catholics. One hypothesis advanced to account for this anomalous finding was that Catholicism for the average lower class Puerto Rican is largely nominal. Protestantism, on the other hand, because of its minority status and the relatively recent conversion of its members, tends to be taken more seriously by its adherents who may adopt a fairly conservative position as regards family relations.
In Jamaica we have precisely the reverse circumstance. Catholics represent less than a tenth of the population, while the bulk of the population is traditionally Protestant. It will therefore be of particular interest to see whether the minority status of the Catholic in Jamaica has produced a closer adherence to Catholic teaching with respect to family planning.
It must first be noted, however, that in fact the lower class Jamaican Catholic in our sample2 is not conspicuously fervid in

a general sense. Less than a third of the Catholic women in our sample (which included only women with current sexual partners) are married--the remainder are from a religious point of view "living in sin." Only about a fifth attend church services weekly, despite the fact that under ordinary circumstances missing church, on Sunday entails a mortal sin for a Catholic. Finally, fewer Catholics than non-Catholics said that religion was "very important" to them. Because of these facts, it would seem preferable not to treat Catholics as a group but to divide them into different classes to see whether any differentiation of attitude exists among them. We shall do this in several different ways--according to religious affiliation of the woman's partner; according to the respondent's church attendance; according to her marital status (as a measure of her religiosity) and according to her exposure to modern ideas (as judged by her education and residence). Because of the small number of Catholic women in the sample we shall have to make each of these classifications independently of the others.
There are 59 cases in the present sample

2 T h e data here reported were collected by a team of female Jamaican interviewers in 1956. The survey consisted of an island-wide sample of 1340 women chosen to be representative of urban, rural and townswomen meeting certain criteria of age

(between 14 and 40) ; marital status (mated, whether married, common law or in regular liaison) ; and class (a maximum of elementary school education). Because oversampling of towns and urban areas was employed, the deck of Hollerith cards was "weighted" to adjust for the deficiency in proportion rural, increasing the number of cards by about 40 per cent. Throughout this paper, a "w" signifies that the weighted deck was used.

The incidence of marriage is low among those with no religion (probably a function of the young age of this group) and somewhat high among the faithful denominationals. Other groups show little variation.
The foregoing data suggest the direction for further analysis! First, since marriage shows little relation to our measure of "'faithfulness" to religion for Catholics (although it does for non-Catholics), it may be that church attendance is an inadequate measure of religiosity for Catholics. Consequently, we shall attempt a new classification, using marriage as the measure of faithfulness to Catholicism. Second, since Catholics, especially the faithful, are outstanding in terms of education and residence, our final classification scheme shall take these variables into account.
As seen in Table 4, using marriage as a measure of religiosity does not change the

picture already presented. Indeed it tends to emphasize the anomalous difference between Catholics and Protestants. Catholics are seen as markedly more favorable to birth control than Protestants on one item, have higher knowledge scores, and lower fertility rates. Moreover, with the exception of preferred family size, married Catholics are no less liberal than those Catholics in illicit relationships. While their fertility is higher, this is a consequence of the greater fertility of all married couples.
We have seen that Catholics tend to be better educated than non-Catholics and are more likely to be urban in residence. This suggests that the explanation for the lack of difference between Catholics and others may be due to their relatively elite status within the lower class. That is, education and urban residence tend to make Catholics more liberal, and religion tends to make him more conservative as regards

.family planning--the net effect being to put him at the same or slightly more liberal level than the non-elite, non-Catholic. To investigate this possibility, we have divided Catholics and non-Catholics into two groups--those who are of sixth-standard education and live in towns or in Kingston, and those who are of less than sixth standard or live in the country. The former will be called "Elite," the latter "Other."
The elite in general, regardless of religious affiliation, tend to have more liberal attitudes, to have practiced family planning and to have lower fertility than the nonelite. Catholics and non-Catholics do not show much differentiation when elite status is held constant, but where differences do occur, the Catholics again emerge as somewhat more liberal (e.g., in right to use birth control and knowledge score) . Especially noteworthy is the low fertility of the Catholic elite, a factor which calls for further explanation.
This phenomenon cannot be accounted for in terms of marital status. The fertility

of the married is considerably higher than that of the unmarried in our sample. The fact that 36 per cent of the Catholic elite but only 29 per cent of the non-Catholic elite are married makes the fertility discrepancy even more surprising. Moreover, the former contracted their first sexual unions (of three months or more duration) at a median age of 16.6, the latter at 17.1, and the average age of both groups is identical (29.5).
The only clue we have is the rather high rate of childlessness among the Catholic elite--25 per cent as opposed to 16 per cent of the non-Catholic elite, as seen in Table 6.

The fertility rates of mothers show that the lower fertility of the Catholic elite is largely explicable in terms of childlessness, although this does not account for differences between elite and non-elite. When we examine the group of childless Catholic elite, we find that although they are largely unmarried (87 per cent) they have had an average of 5.2 years of exposure to the risk of conception, all want to have a child and none has practiced birth control. We must conclude, therefore, that the rate of sterility is unusually high in this group, but why this is so is beyond the scope of our investigation. In any event, it would seem that part of the explanation for nonuse of birth control among the Catholic elite is infertility rather than Catholicism.
An independent datum which confirms our impression that Catholics are not especially affected by religious teaching on birth control is provided by the records of the Jamaican Family Planning Clinic. Located in Kingston, the clinic has had over 7,000 patients in its eighteen years of existence. Most of these came from the metropolitan area, although recently over a third have been coming from the country. Eighteen per cent of the clinic's patients have been Roman Catholic. In the population as a whole, only 7 per cent are Catholic, and in the metropolitan area 19 per cent. Conclusions
Although we have attempted several different ways of classifying religious groups, we have been unable to detect among Roman Catholic women any special con-

servatism as regards family planning, whether this be in the area of knowledge, attitudes or actual behavior. Indeed, largely due to their superior education and urban residence they tend to be more liberal than non-Catholics in general.
When similar findings were established in Puerto Rico, we speculated that the minority status of Protestants might make them especially fervid and conservative in belief, and the majority status of Catholics make them lax as regards church teaching. The fact that we find precisely the same pattern in Jamaica where the majorityminority positions of Catholics and Protestants are reversed throws, considerable doubt on this hypothesis and suggests that among lower class populations in some underdeveloped areas, the influence of Catholic teaching in the sphere of family planning has been negligible. Indeed, one wonders whether the Church's teachings on this subject may not be boomeranging by spreading knowledge of family planning among the uneducated classes.
Some critics have suggested that our samples are too small to make firm generalizations about comparative religious behavior in Puerto Rico and Jamaica; and that the survey interview method has a number of deficiencies which cast doubt on findings in this area. The small numbers do necessitate caution about generalization. However, the large number of cases of actual behavior reported by the Jamaica Family Planning Clinic appear to substantiate our findings.
