DOES THE EFFECT OF A FAMILY PLANNING PROGRAM CONTINUE?
YOSHIO KOYA Family Planning Federation of Japan

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:27 08 December 2015

During 1949-1956 we gave family planning instructions to the people of three typical villages in Japan. The aim of the study was to learn to what extent we could turn noncontraceptors in these villages into contraceptors by offering them an ideal education in family planning, accompanied with contraceptive supplies. The results were published in the Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly, October 1958.
Six years have passed since then. It is appropriate, therefore, to investigate whether the effect of the education is still observable and to judge the reproductive behavior of the younger generation who married after the close of our guidance program: Have they been influenced by their parents, senior friends, or others in the villages to practice family planning, and if so, in what ways have they acquired a knowledge of contraception?
PROCEDURES FOR COLLECTING DATA
To answer these questions we interviewed wives under 50 years of age in the same three villages where we had carried out our earlier guidance program six years ago. As of June 1962 there were 1,125 wives in these villages, of whom 813 were under 50 years of age. Our respondents were wives who could be interviewed in their homes during April-June 1962. They numbered 759, or 93% of the 813 under 50 years of age.
 With the cooperation of Dr. Hidebumi Kubo, Dr. Minoru Muramatsu, and Dr. Hiroshi Ogino.

The other 7% were out of the villages working for public and voluntary services, or were traveling to sell the produce raised on their farms.
Of the 759 respondents, 584 had received our instruction during 1949-1956; 175 had married after 1956 and, accordingly, did not receive any instruction in family planning from us. For convenience, we will call the former group A, the latter group B. The age distributions are given in Table 1.
Our procedure to collect the information for this study was as follows. The medical doctors on my staff, the present writer, and some other doctors employed temporarily from health centers visited each house, interviewed the wife, and filled out the card questionnaire on each family that we brought with us. Midwives did not fill out the questionnaire, because certain items on it required a medical expert. The midwives proved to be an asset as assistants in the home visits, because they were better able to establish the human relations with each family than the medical experts.

PROPORTION OF CONTRACEPTORS
The Mainichi Population Survey Office has published data on the degree of contraceptive practice among Japanese wives in 1962. This information was available as a standard by which we could judge the findings in our villages. Table 2 shows the percentage of contraceptors among the A and B groups and the A + B group in comparison with the Mainichi data.
As is seen in Table 2, the proportion of contraceptors among the village wives as a whole (A + B group) is 61.7%, whereas the corresponding figure given by the Mainichi survey is 46.4. That is, contraceptive practice is a third larger in the villages than in agricultural Japan generally.1 It is worth noticing that the denominator of the proportion includes those who have no need to practice contraception. If it were limited only to those to whom we would recommend such practice, the proportion of contraceptors might increase to some 86-96%.
1 A more accurate comparison would result from standardizing our data for age distribution, but this could not be done because the age composition was not given in the Mainichi report. We do not think, however, that this factor would significantly affect the findings.

Even among the B group--the uninstructed group--the proportion of contraceptors, 54.6%, is larger than that of the average agricultural wife in Japan.
These findings suggest, first, that the effect of the education given to the village more than six years ago is still in evidence and, second, that it is exerting a considerable influence upon the reproductive behavior of the younger generation.
In what way, then, did the younger couples (B group) obtain their knowledge of contraception? We tried to determine the channels through which they obtained the necessary knowledge. The results are shown in Table 3.
The following findings emerge from Table 3:
1. All sources of information reached almost twice as many of the wives in these villages as Japanese wives in general.
2. Information was most frequently acquired from publications. Among our village wives 82.2% received knowledge from some publication or other, compared with 45.5% for agricultural Japanese wives in general. The very high proportion among our wives may be

attributed to the many pamphlets and leaflets we distributed among the women during our period of guidance, which it may be presumed were kept and subsequently read by the younger women. Incidentally, this observation led us to appreciate the difficulty of disseminating family-planning information among loweducated or illiterate people.
3. The role of midwives also was very great. In our villages 46.3% of the young wives obtained their knowledge of contraception from midwives. In confirmation of this finding it should be noted that the figure is lowest in Fukuura Village, where the midwives retired soon after the close of our guidance program in 1956.
4. When other sources of information were utilized, the younger wives did not generally learn from their parents or other family members. In pursuing this question further, we discovered that the percentage of 34.9 applied mainly to talks and discussions with friends, not family. Another noteworthy point is that the corresponding figure in Fukuura is very high, while that in Kamifunaka is particularly low, namely 70.0% and 40.0%, respectively. We considered the plausible reasons and unanimously agreed that the opportunities to discuss

contraceptives with friends in an old, feudal-type village, such as Kamifunaka, must be very limited; whereas in a village such as Fukuura, where many girls and wives work in hotels as waitresses or on golf links as caddies, opportunities to discuss birth control problems with friends would be plentiful. The differences in the two villages may thus account for the marked difference in communication with family members on contraception.
The findings indicate clearly that the contraceptive-mindedness of the wives in our villages who received our guidance in family planning six or more years ago is still in evidence. Moreover, it is exerting a great influence upon the reproductive behavior of the younger generation.
BIRTH RATE AND PREGNANCY RATE
To support this view we calculated the crude birth rate for the population of the three villages, using data offered by the mayors' offices. We also calculated the pregnancy rate of the village wives whom we interviewed, limiting ourselves to the last three years because of the added uncertainty of recall for a longer lapse of time.
It will be noted in Table 4 that the

crude birth rate in these villages is not only declining rapidly but is considerably lower than the Japanese birth rate of 16-17 in 1960-1962. Part of this decline results from the changing age structure of the population, namely the growing proportion of older people. In our villages this proportion is probably relatively high, 66% of the wives being over 35 years of age according to our survey. Moreover, it is becoming a general phenomenon throughout the agricultural areas of Japan for the husbands of young couples to leave their farms to earn more money as white collar salaried workers or laborers in urban areas. Agespecific birth rates would provide a more meaningful comparison of our villages with Japan as a whole, but our sample is too small for detailed analysis by small age groups. Although the decline

in the pregnancy rate from 15.1 in the last year of guidance to 13.3 at present lies partly in age structure and absent husbands, a further reasonable factor is the effect of the education in family planning.
CONTRACEPTIVES USED TODAY
Although it was not the main subject of this study, we investigated what contraceptive methods the village wives were using and compared these findings with the corresponding data for the last period of our guidance as well as with the Mainichi survey. The results are shown in Table 5.
Table 5 reveals some interesting observations. The proportion of condom users increased somewhat from six years ago and is larger than among the average Japanese couple. Diaphragm users are more than twice as prevalent among our wives than among Japanese wives in general, which indicates the influence of our guidance program. This finding is reinforced by the fact that diaphragms were 40% more popular among the older (A group) than younger (B group) women who had not received our guidance. Another point which draws our attention is the increase in foam tablet users among younger people, 18.3%, compared with only 5% six years ago.
More than a third among both older and younger women still use the safe period despite our repeated warnings of the difficulty of calculating the safe period accurately. The Mainichi survey found almost the same percentage, 40%, for the country as a whole resorting to the safe period. These findings confirm our view of the urgent necessity to find a simple test to determine the safe period so that the people at large can use the method effectively.

REASONS FOR STOPPAGE AND
NON-USE OF CONTRACEPTION
There were 188 wives who answered that they had been practicing contraception but were not users at the time of inquiry. An additional 178 persons said they had never practiced a method. We investigated the reasons and obtained the results shown in Tables 6 and 7.
The grouping of the reasons for stop-

ping into the three major categories shown in Table 6 yields some interesting conclusions. Of the older women (A group), 71% stopped for reasons that suggest they were not likely to conceive, chiefly because they had reached the menopause. Inasmuch as the A group contained 164 women 45 to 49 years of age, it is entirely reasonable that 65 women claimed to be beyond their re-

productive years. The younger women, on the other hand, stopped primarily because of a current interest in children.
About a fifth of the women who stopped did so for reasons that can be classified as nonmotivated to practice. In other words, about 80% of the village wives who stopped practicing contraception had valid reasons to stop.
As in the case of the women who have stopped, there is a distinct difference between the older and younger women in the reasons for never having practiced. Three-fourths of the younger women (B group) who have never practiced are currently interested in children. On the other hand, almost two-thirds of the older women without practice have either reached their menopause childless or are either voluntarily or involuntarily sterile. In both groups only about 10% have never practiced for reasons that may be considered lack of motivation.
It may be remarked that the seven women (representing 4% in each group) who habitually resort to induced abor-

tion to terminate pregnancy, come from Minamoto village where many wives travel in urban areas selling silk goods. This affords them the opportunity to resort to induced abortion without being known.
THE CHANNEL OF CONTRACEPTIVE SUPPLIES
We conducted a small-scale survey to determine the channels through which the village wives obtained contraceptive supplies. The results indicated that 54% procured them from pharmacies in and out of the villages, 17.8% through midwives, and 9.7% from health centers free of charge under the Public Relief program. Health centers and miscellaneous sources account for the remaining 18%.
SUMMARY
Over a seven-year period from 1949 to 1956 we gave instruction and guidance in family planning to the people in the three typical villages in Japan. The aim

Vol. 11, No. 3

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:27 08 December 2015

of the program was to ascertain to what extent noncontraceptors would become contraceptors when offered information and supplies.
Six years have elapsed since we terminated our guidance program. The present study was therefore planned to investigate whether our village wives were still practicing contraception and whether our instruction to their parents was exerting any influence upon the reproductive behavior of the younger couples who married after the close of the program.
The findings in the present study suggest a continuing influence of our 19491956 guidance program. In 1962 the proportion of contraceptors among our village wives under 50 years of age was 61.7%. This compares with 46.4% found in 1962 by the Mainichi Population Investigation Office on the average for Japanese agricultural wives. The former is 33% higher than the latter. Even more gratifying is the finding that 54.4% of the younger women who never had received our instruction were practicing contraception. For the country as a whole this figure is likely to be below the national average of 46.4% because many of them, having married recently, want children.
We were interested in knowing from what sources the younger couples obtained their knowledge of contraception. The results showed that more than 80% had obtained knowledge from some publication, whereas the corresponding percentage for the average Japanese wife was 45.5. This difference may be at-

tributed to the fact that we distributed pamphlets and leaflets many times among the village people during the guidance program. The young couples may have read this literature and thereby obtained their knowledge of contraception.
The role played by midwives or caseworkers in providing information was also considerable in that they imparted knowledge to 46.3% of the village concerned. The cases in which knowledge was obtained from parents or family members were rather few.
Finally, we observed the general trend of the crude birth rate of these villages. From 13.6 in 1956 when we closed our program, it decreased to 8.9 in 1962. The pregnancy rate for the wives we interviewed dropped to 13.3 in 1962, from 15.1 in 1956.
Although part of the decline may be attributed to the changing age structure and absence of young husbands, the findings indicate that our educational program in our villages was very effective. We attribute a major part of our success to the literacy of our village people. Nevertheless, our approach suggests that if people are adequately informed and supplied, the practice of contraception can spread rapidly.
ACKNOWLEDGMENT
I wish to express my appreciation to the people in the Demographic Division of the Population Council, New York, whose interest and assistance have been very encouraging.
