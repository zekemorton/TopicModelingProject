HUMAN POPULATION GENETICS AND DEMOGRAPHY: A SELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHY

CARL JAY BAJEMA Senior Population Council Fellow in Demography
and Population Genetics, 1966-1967 Population Research and Training Center
University of Chicago Chicago, Illinois

Both demography and population genetics are concerned with the study of populations. Yet these two disciplines have developed independently of each other, and it is a rare student who receives formal training in both these areas of population research. Integrating these two approaches to the study of population will provide a sounder basis for the analysis and prediction of population trends.
The following bibliography is designed to enable the demographer or population geneticist to locate papers of

major importance in genetical demography quickly. Genetic-statistical research with respect to industrial societies has been treated in greater depth than research with respect to isolate and primitive populations. Many additional papers of a more specialized nature can be located by checking the bibliographies of the references listed below. The indexing, abstracting, and bibliographic services that exist in demographyx and human genetics 2 will enable the investigator to keep abreast of current research in the field of genetical demography.
