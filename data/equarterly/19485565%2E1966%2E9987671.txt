INCOME, SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS, AND FERTILITY IN THE UNITED STATES*

Cumulative fertility rates of women married once with husband present have earlier been examined with husband's principal occupation (Mitra, 1966a) and mother's highest grade of school completed (Mitra, 1966b) as major classificatory variables. In the present study, an attempt has been made to analyze the fertility differentials by income and socioeconomic status (s.e.s.) categories, where s.e.s. developed by the Bureau of the Census is based on a composite score using three variables, namely, occupation, education, and income. Materials of this report have been obtained from the one in one thousand sample of the 1960 census.
Before the middle of this century, fertility studies (Whelpton and Riser, 1950; U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1950) revealed an inverse relationship between fertility and economic status. A strong relation between socioeconomic status and fertility planning status was suggested by these earlier findings. Later investigations (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1953; Grabill et al., 1958) failed to confirm such simple relationship, and current fertility rates were found to fluctuate irregularly by husband's income. The conclusion drawn from these studies is that children are no longer found in relatively large numbers among those who are hard-pressed to support them.
The hypothesis recently presented and

supported by data (Freedman, 1963; Kurz, 1965) is that the couples with more relative income compared with other couples in the same education, occupation, and age category can afford to have more children while maintaining the same style of life of their social class. This raises the number of children born

per couple in an upper income bracket, and the extent of such increase depends on the proportion of those who belong to relatively lower occupation-education groups when compared with the normative pattern of that category. Similarly, fertility in a lower income bracket is lowered by the proportion in such group who belong, or perhaps aspire to belong, to relatively higher occupation-education categories.

Whatever be the reasons for the disappearance of a strong inverse relationship between economic status and fertility and for the emergence of factors responsible for the trend of recent fertility (which were nonexistent in the past), the fact remains that access to economic opportunities continues to remain at a lower level for those who support a larger family in relation to

their income. This will remain so even

if the relationship between income and

fertility changes to a direct one, as long

Consequently, an analysis of the current fertility situation can be expected to provide important guidelines to a

measurement of the impact of population growth on national economy as well as to action programs oriented to improve the general level of living. With that in view, cohort fertility in this report has been examined by race, income, and s.e.s. categories in order to provide factual information on the subject. The findings, however, relate only to those women who are married once with husband present. Selection of such women to the exclusion of others has been made for assuring greater homogeneity and operational simplicity, but that does not greatly restrict the scope of this analysis since these women represent about 86% of those who are presently married.
It may also be noted that although data on income for a sample of persons were collected in the 1950 census, the sampling design was such that no analysis of children ever born to married women by total family income is possible. Unfortunately, therefore, no straightforward comparison can be attempted with the 1950 census, when 1960 data on children born are classified either by total family income or by s.e.s. Such comparisons, however, were possible with occupation and education as principal variables (Mitra, 1966).

INCOME AND FERTILITY
Income as a variable may be related either to the principal income-recipient or may be extended to include the contributions of other family members as well. In this study, total family income rather than that of the principal earner has been used, since for all practical reasons, the former appears to be a better indicator of a family's level of living. Needless to say, total family income as such is a crude index of level of living, inasmuch as the latter is also dependent upon family size, age-sex composition, place of residence, and a multiplicity of other variables. As a matter of fact, however, the compounding effects of these variables do not seem to alter the general pattern of relationship when total family income is substituted for a more refined measure of level of living.
The distribution of women and their median family incomes is shown in Table 1 by race and age.1
In general, higher age is associated with higher income. Median family income for whites, which is little less than $4,000 for wives aged 15-19 and over $5,000 for those in the next age-group, crosses the $7,000 mark at 35-39 and

remains fairly stable thereafter. In contrast, the nonwhites not only have median incomes lower than whites, but the relative increase from one age-group to the next is also smaller, such that the divergence between the two races continues to increase with age. Further, if an annual family income of $2,000 or less is arbitrarily denned as below subsistence level, the two races compare as shown in Table 2.
For both whites and nonwhites, percentages are high for wives under 20 years of age, which, however, is understandable. For the remaining agegroups, the percentages are quite low for whites, whereas the decline in percentages for nonwhites is not appreciable. On the whole, more than a fifth of nonwhite families hardly earn enough to support themselves, and this proportion will further increase if the cut-off point is set above the arbitrary $2,000 limit. It may be mentioned, however, that despite small percentages, distressed white families outnumber the nonwhites because of a larger population base. The low level of living to which this large segment of the population has been subjected can be better understood if, in addition to income, the reproductive behavior is also brought into consideration. This has been shown in Table 3.
Although there are quite a few exceptions, the inverse relationship between income and fertility has not totally disappeared, and in fact such a relation is more clear for whites than for non-

whites. If per capita rather than total family income is used, the inverse relationship can be expected to be much stronger. However, as mentioned before, it is not only enough to observe the presence or absence of an inverse relationship, but it is also important to examine the significance of these distributions as such. Table 3 suggests a few general comments.
First, cumulative fertility does not necessarily increase with age. This has happened because of an increasing trend in fertility rates during the past few years, which in turn reflects variable marital and child-bearing experiences and changing attitude toward family formation on the part of different cohorts of women.
Second, women in lower income groups have given birth to more children in relation to their income. Third, even for these women, nonwhites have higher fertility rates in all ages, which must have had the effect of lowering per capita income further in the already low-income category. Fourth, nonwhites in upper income groups also limit the number of children born to them, and there are instances where cohort fertility rates of nonwhites are similar or even less than those of their white counterparts.
Finally, the range of variation in total number of children born over the income-axis is much smaller for whites in all age-groups. A large part of this difference is, however, explained by very large white-nonwhite differentials in the

lower income groups. In fact, the nonwhite rates are so high for the lowest two income groups as to be indicative of no or inadequate family planning efforts on their part.
It seems that whites in low-income groups, who are few in number in relation to the total white population, have been able to internalize the values of the larger society and accordingly have fewer children than is biologically possible. Low-income nonwhites, on the other hand, comprise a sizable proportion of nonwhites and have developed a subculture of their own, relatively impermeable to external influences. The greater society, however, appears to serve as a reference group to nonwhites in the upper end of the income distribution, at least insofar as attitude toward family planning is concerned. It seems reasonable, therefore, to assume that action programs directed to economic improvement of the nonwhites will be rewarded by a favorable response toward fertility control.
SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS AND FERTILITY
Socioeconomic status score was determined in the following way: the chief income-recipient of a family was given a score ranging from 0 to 99 corresponding to each of the three variables, namely his occupation and education as well as the total family income (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1953). A simple average of these three scores rounded to the nearest whole score was defined as a measure of s.e.s. of the whole family. Scores thus obtained were then combined to form 10 groups, each consisting of 10 successive scores.
It may be noted that after a certain age, an individual's score on education becomes invariant, although he may, during his lifetime, move up along the income or the occupation axis or both.

For a society that is upwardly mobile, the s.e.s. score will therefore increase with age, like income or occupation scores. But the relative constancy of scores in education will act as a dampening factor, and hence will reduce the range of variation of s.e.s. scores over one's life cycle, in comparison with the corresponding ranges of scores with respect to income or occupation. Further, low-income families may have high s.e.s. scores if the chief income recipient scores high in education. Similarly, if income increases with age, s.e.s. scores will be lower than income scores for older individuals who are low in education or occupation. Considering these three variables, it may be expected that s.e.s. as a summary measure will be a better index of social stratification than either of the three component variables, since it assures greater homogeneity within and heterogeneity between groups.
Accordingly, if irregularities in the socalled inverse relation between income and fertility is caused primarily by a preponderance of persons with incomes higher than the average of their social class (Kurz, 1965), such fluctuations should be considerably reduced when the distribution is examined by s.e.s. scores. This will be so because these persons, in spite of their higher incomes, will have lower s.e.s. scores than those with education and occupation statuses conforming to the standards of that income category. Similarly, the effect of higher education but relatively lower income, which must have distorted the inverse relation between income and fertility, will be less unfavorable with s.e.s. categories because of higher scores in relation to income. Table 4 shows the actual pattern.
Unfortunately, a strict inverse relation between s.e.s. and fertility is not supported by Table 4, although such a ten-

dency, more pronounced for the whites, is present. It is, however, difficult to compare the present distribution by s.e.s. with that by income because of irregular fluctuations in both. But it can be observed that the range of variation in total number of children born is larger with s.e.s. than with income in every age-group. Perhaps this is so because classification by the former results in more homogeneous groups than by the latter. Thus, women in the lowest s.e.s. category have borne considerably more children than those in the lowest income group.
The following facts relating differential fertility with race and s.e.s. categories are worth mentioning. First, nonwhite rates are uniformly higher than whites' for s.e.s. groups 1 to 6 with a few minor exceptions.
Second, both races have demonstrated higher fertility rates at the lower end of the s.e.s. scale, but the differential is highest for s.e.s. Group 1 and quite often is large enough to indicate that, on an average, nonwhites have given birth to one more child than have the whites.
Third, for both races cumulative fertility declines dramatically from s.e.s. Group 1 to s.e.s. Group 2. The reductions are as high as 1 child for whites and 1.5 children for nonwhites in the age-group 30-34. It may be recalled that a similar difference in cumulative fertility rates was also observed between the lowest two income groups. It is indeed interesting to observe that a little more education or a little better and more stable job opportunity or both, which differentiates the lowest two s.e.s. groups from one another, can have such an impact on their reproductive behavior.
Fourth, white women in age-groups 30-34 and 35-39 have already given birth to more children than have their

predecessor cohorts; so by the time these women reach the end of their fertile period, the differences can be expected to be still higher.
Fifth, cumulative fertility rates of whites become virtually stable as soon as s.e.s. Group 7 is reached, although there are differences among different cohorts of women. Nonwhite women in these categories are relatively few, but evidences clearly suggest that not only have they closed the gap at s.e.s. Group 7, but often their rates are also lower than whites.
Finally, differences between highest and lowest cumulative fertility of women aged 30 and over are found to be little less than 2.0 for whites and ranging from 2.5 to 3.0 for nonwhites. These observations are suggestive of the extent to which fertility decline can be expected to occur if s.e.s. compositions can be influenced to take a favorable turn.
DISCUSSION
An examination of the 1960 census data on total number of children born to women married once with husband present has confirmed the recent findings about irregular fluctuations in;the so-called inverse relationship between fertility and economic status. It was felt that s.e.s., being a better index of social stratification than income is,would show stronger relationship; but that could not be greatly substantiated even though additional control was gained by restricting the selection of women to those who were married once with husband present. It is quite possible that s.e.s. groups as such are also lacking in required amount of homogeneity and under additional control may produce a straightforward inverse relationship. The latter can, however, be tested by selecting only those women who have s.e.s. scores with all three components con-
