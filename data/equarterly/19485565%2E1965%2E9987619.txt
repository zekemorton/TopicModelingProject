The extensive polarization of many contemporary psychiatric writers, regarding their concepts on the etiology of schizophrenia, has given rise to considerable debate which has involved investigators in such diverse disciplines as psychoanalysis, sociology, chemistry, and biology. The etiology of schizophrenia has been relevant to investigators in numerous disciplines, but distinguished contributors to one discipline have sometimes been relatively na'ive regarding others. This multidisciplinary context has evidently facilitated debates by protagonists who may have been semantically and technically isolated from each other. There is little scientific controversy concerning expected eventual discovery of chemical and/or histological correlates with the psychoses. Otherwise, the phenomena could be regarded as supernatural or metaphysical entities. Specific biochemical correlates with schizophrenia or its biochemical etiology, however, have not yet been established; and such discoveries do not appear imminent.
Organic parameters apparently correlated with schizophrenia have been studied by many investigators. Numerous reports have been published, describing correlations between schizophrenic diagnoses and appearance of particular biochemical variables. In general, the reports of both quantitative and qualitative biochemical correlates with schizophrenia have lacked replication by investigators at other laboratories (Kaplan,

1958). Hoffer and Osmond (1963), Friedhof and Van Winkle (1962), and others have contributed recent reports describing urinary compounds believed to be correlated with mental disorder. A major difficulty for investigators of biochemical parameters relevant to schizophrenia concerns the control of manifestations which may be correlated with effects of the disorder and/or consequent confinement and treatment, rather than with causes of the disorder. Numerous biochemical changes that have been associated with schizophrenia have been changes which characterize people under stress--i.e., the third phase of resistance described bySelye (1956). Common adaptive tendencies may be manifested in response to various different stresses. A diagnostic category in psychiatry may associate patients with similar functional disturbances which resulted from different causative factors. Thus, our present diagnostic system may be biologically irrelevant (Katz and Cole, 1963).
In contrast to the difficulties encountered in the investigation of biochemical variables, such as metabolic products in urine or blood, morphological measures could facilitate more consistent and reliable correlates. Surveys by Cowie, Coppen, and Norman (1960) and Rey and Coppen (1959) indicated that schizophrenics as a group differed markedly from normal subjects with regard to biacromial diameter and anatomical androgyny score (3 x biacromial diameter in cm. minus 1x bi-iliac diameter in

cm.). Schizophrenic patients of both sexes were found to have much lower (i.e., more female) androgyny scores and smaller biacromial diameters than normal men and women. The constitutional implications of such anthropometric differences were thought to suggest the possibility of correlating schizophrenia with quantitive sex-chromatin distribution in buccal cells (Kaplan and Gonzalez, 1964). Our study indicated that the positive scores of schizophrenic female patients were significantly higher than those of nonpatient controls. A group of nonschizophrenic hospitalized female mental patients, diagnosed as "character disorders," were also found to be significantly higher than the nonpatient group but not significantly different from the group of schizophrenic patients. Our data, therefore, did not indicate a variable which distribution reflected any characteristic of schizophrenics. The parameter may have been associated in some way with hospitalization at a psychiatric institution. Contrastingly, however, Platt and Kailin (1964) reported that female psychotic patients had relatively low sex-chromatin counts. Probably, methodological and/ or sample differences accounted for much of the discrepancy in the two studies, and additional investigation would be required for understanding and rectifying the contrasting observations.
Investigators and theoreticians on the etiology of schizophrenia have been handicapped by the lack of a clearly defined and objectively applicable taxonomy. The use of a symptom-oriented classification scheme in psychiatry provides for grouping patients according to their symptoms rather than according to the disorders underlying the symptoms. Many reported inconsistencies regarding

implicated variables--psychodynamic, genetical, endocrinological, immunological, psychological and physical stress-- might be resolved within a framework of multicausality (Fessel, 1964). Many of the relevant reports have not specified whether the "schizophrenics" studied were "ambulatory schizophrenics" who would be classified by some psychiatrists as neurotics rather than schizophrenics; or "chronic schizophrenics," some of whose constitutional parameters could have been influenced by prolonged hospitalization; or "childhood schizophreics" who would not be considered schizophrenics by some clinicians. Even similar patient populations at the same hospital, diagnosed by different staff clinicians during the same time period, have yielded inconsistent results. Thus, Mehlman (1952) tabulated the diagnoses of 1,358 patients made by 16 psychiatrists during the same time period at a single state hospital and found highly significant differences in the diagnoses of the various clinicians. Similar observations were previously reported by Ash (1949) and others (Boisen, 1938; Doering, 1934). More recent studies have also supported the observations of diagnostic unreliability (Beck, 1962; Sandifer, Pettus, and Quade, 1964). Such reports have suggested that recent systems of psychiatric classification have limited value for research. Kallmann (1953) has regarded family history as being of primary importance to accurate diagnosis of schizophrenia. The requirement of positive family history as a criterion for schizophrenic diagnosis is based on the hypothesis of a genetic basis for predisposition to development of the disorder. Jackson (1960, 1964), on the other hand, has criticized the use of family histories in schizophrenic diagnoses for what he considers circular reasoning: the impor-

tance of family history in a schizophrenic diagnosis has been based on the genetic hypothesis, which has been based on data collected in conformity with that hypothesis. Given the same patient population, the diagnostic data of two psychiatrists such as Jackson and Kallmann would be inconsistent and would not support the same genetic hypotheses (Jackson, 1964). The explanation of Kallmann (1953) that schizophrenia and manic-depressive psychosis represent two distinct entities was consistent with his diagnostic data. The demonstrated diagnostic inconsistencies of these categories as applied by different clinicians, however, indicate that they have not been reliably recognized entities: the randomness of diagnostic distribution into the schizophrenic and manic-depressive categories (i.e., regardless of clinical symptomatology, clinical and family histories) were, in Mehlman's study, largely reflections of the diagnosticians' varying interpretations and schools of thought. Rosen (1962) has discarded even the concept that manic-depressive psychosis and the schizophrenic categories represent separate entities, and he has regarded them as phases of the same disorder. Fish (1963) has opposed any sharp diagnostic separation of the functional psychoses on the ground that all of them could be explained as being due to disorders within the reticular system. The markedly different criteria and frames of reference utilized by the different psychiatrists in diagnosing schizophrenia, and the demonstrated diagnostic inconsistencies, mean that the schizophrenic diagnoses reflect the diagnosticians' schools of thought as well as the patients' symptoms. Many patients would or would not be diagnosed as schizophrenic, depending on the particular psychiatrists providing the diagnoses.

Patients with schizophrenic diagnoses, as a group, do not represent a simple category of mental disorder, but rather a constellation or even many constellations. In this context, however, geneticists have been describing modes of transmission of "the schizophrenic genotype." The discussion of genetic factors in schizophrenia by Stern (1960), for example, has not explored the diagnostic differences and conflicts (e.g., regarding the diagnostic role of family history)-- and has treated the heterogeneous constellations of schizophrenia as if they represented a universally consistent and reliably diagnosed disease entity. Stern's discussion has included the Mendelian recessive genetic etiology as advanced by Kallmann (1953) and the Mendelian dominant genetic etiology as advanced by Book (1953) and Slater (1958), but he has not indicated that diagnostic data from other clinicians and investigators have simply not conformed to the above genetic concepts. Recently, two other biologists, Julian Huxley and Ernst Mayr, joined with Osmond and Hoffer to describe schizophrenia as a "genetic morphism" (Huxley, Mayr, Osmond, and Hoffer, 1964). These writers stressed the imminence of pending discoveries of chemical and psychological tests to clearly differentiate "schizophrenics" from patients with other mental disorders. They advanced the explanation of schizophrenia etiology involving a single genetic locus and dominant gene, and cited reports by genetically oriented writers upon which their generalized explanations were based. Huxley, Mayr, Osmond, and Hoffer did not, however, consider the psychiatric writers whose concepts and data have not been consistent with such a simple genetic explanation.
There are investigators and clinicians

whose diagnostic criteria and data have supported hypotheses involving primary genetic factors in the etiology of what they consider "schizophrenia." There are also investigators and clinicians whose diagnostic criteria and data have not supported such concepts. Studies have indicated that psychiatric diagnoses have exhibited high degrees of randomness. Diagnostic distribution has been shown to have been affected by concepts of thediagnosing clinicians, andto have differed radically even among staff members of the same hospital during the same time period. Thus, the hypotheses supported or opposed by particular groups of diagnostic data mayhave, in part, reflected the particular diagnosticians' bias. The significance of biological studies that are tied to our current diagnostic system in psychiatry is attenuated by theunreliability andbiological irrelevance of the diagnostic system. The disagreement among psychiatrists regarding schizophrenic diagnoses minimizes the value of hypotheses designed to explain the general etiology of schizophrenia because each hypothesis has been based on selected diagnostic data. The value of any simple theory on the etiology of schizophrenia remains questionable as long as theconcepts and diagnoses of "schizophrenia" remain inconsistent and heterogeneous.
