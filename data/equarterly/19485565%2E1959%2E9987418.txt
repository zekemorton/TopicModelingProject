,. DISCUSSION OF THE EFFECTS OF MODERN
therapies on schizophrenia is bound to be controversial, not only because of the discrepancies in reported results but in view of the extreme polarities of etiological concepts. I have always been convinced and the Second International Congress for Psychiatry which was entirely devoted to schizophrenia did much to strengthen my belief that many conflicting concepts stem substantially from dissimilar clinical experiences. The panorama of clinical and social manifestations of schizophrenia is extremely wide. A comprehensive concept of schizophrenia requires therefore a study of schizophrenic patients which is neither limited in the dimension of time nor confined to the selection of particular groups of schizophrenics. The mere intensity of personal therapeutic involvement with selected schizophrenic patients for a year, or even several years, cannot provide the same panoramic view of schizophrenia as prolonged experience in psychiatric hospitals with unselected patient populations.
What seems distressing is the evidence
of orientational provincialism which
permits a given group, be it a univer-
sity department, a research institute or
a hospital, to feature images of schizo-
phrenia which are totally unrelated to

valid findings from other quarters. Thus, schizophrenia is taught to be a biochemical deficiency in one place but is regarded as a love-deprivation state elsewhere; and while genetic data are carefully documented by experts, extrabiologic transmission is vigorously proclaimed by schools of interpersonalism. Although divergent positions must exist side by side to await scientific confirmation or disproof, progress may be impeded by the professed disinterest of some groups in the investigative evidence of their opponents. As scientists, university teachers and physicians, we should be alarmed by the fact that a substantial number of our medical students are not only not exposed to the complexity of pertinent approaches to schizophrenia but are indoctrinated to accept preferred hypotheses as facts.
Eugenic approaches to psychiatric family problems depend on the knowledge of the applicability of principles of human genetics to mental health. Kallmann states: "In promoting general recognition of genetic phenomena in man as a potent safeguard of public health, now and in the future, the discipline of psychiatric genetics will need the help of the scientist as well as the social worker, of the psychologist as well as the statistician, of the specialist as well as the family physician." (Kallmann, 1953) Whether or not one wishes

to agree with the principles of eugenic methods on grounds of social philosophy, one cannot hesitate to promote a deeper understanding of the implications which human genetics has for all schools concerned with mental health and disease.
I speak to you as a clinical psychiatrist. My knowledge of the applicability of genetic principles is minimal at best. But I have never believed that a productive study of schizophrenia can be achieved without an awareness of, and inquiry into, the complexities of genetic aspects. Perhaps it was easier for me than for many of my colleagues to wonder about the potential significance of genetic influences because of the particular circumstances under which my clinical experience and my investigative work developed. For two decades, I have studied, diagnosed and treated schizophrenic patients at Delaware State Hospital. As the only psychiatric hospital for the entire state, its population includes patients from all socio-economic classes, from urban and rural areas, of varied ethnic background, referred as private cases or committed by family physicians, psychiatrists or social agencies. Due to the absence of other psychiatric in-patient services in the state, patients have always been admitted as soon as they were recognized to be in need of hospital treatment. Multiple hospitalizations during the life of patients meant, with few exceptions, readmission to Delaware State Hospital. Under these circumstances, the usual difficulties which arise from selective factors in the composition of hospital populations are reduced to the very minimum. This eliminates many clinical and social factors of selection which diminish the significance of findings from a single hospital. The smallness of the state permit-

ted close contact between the hospital, the patient and the patient's family. Since 1940, I have personal knowledge of all hospitalized schizophrenic patients.
To overlook the concurrence of schizophrenic psychoses or other mental disorders in particular families would have been difficult indeed. In many case histories I found references to previous admissions of other members of the family. Moreover, there were many revelations on visiting days when one visitor would inquire about his mother, his brother and cousin; or about his brother and sister; or, in the case of parents, about their two or three children. Nevertheless, it required the organizaiton of a special investigative unit to explore as completely as possible the representation of families in the total clinical population. Needless to say, this is not a static material. On the contrary, new aspects unfold from day to day as either the size of a family or the number of families increases in accordance with new admissions.
I believe that my experience with schizophrenic patients and their families has saved me from the temptation to subscribe to particularistic concepts on the nature and origin of schizophrenia. Variation and variability of the manifestations of schizophrenia make it seem unproductive to reduce highly complex matters to simple conceptual models. I shall make an attempt, therefore, to assess the potential effects of modern treatment methods on course and outcome of schizophrenia in families with multiple cases. An analysis of mating and fertility trends will have to be deferred until the resulting social impact is clearly understood. One should also keep in mind that the composition of this clinical material is based on actual hospitalized cases. No efforts have been

SCHIZOPHRENIC FAMILIES
There are 157 families with 2 or more members in the hospital population of which one or more in each family is a

schizophrenic. For this presentation, I have selected those 69 families in which 2 or more members are known to be schizophrenic. These 69 families comprise 208 individuals, 172 of whom are schizophrenic (72 men, 100 women). Table I illustrates the distribution of family units in relation to their proportional share of schizophrenic members.

A family unit is here defined as the total number of mentally ill members for each family. The specially marked squares designate those family units in which all mentally ill members are schizophrenics. All schizophrenics were or are hospitalized: 158 in the Delaware State Hospital and 14 in psychiatric institutions outside of Delaware. For each of these 14 patients, case abstracts and diagnostic summaries were obtained for review.
Table II discloses the primary constellations of family relationships. This arrangement may not only seem arbitrary but useless for genetic analyses. For the purpose of clinical and social evaluations, however, I consider it important to identify the variety of constellations in this manner. Emphasis is placed on primary constellations rather than on total representation of all occurring variations. The main purpose of this arrangement is to indicate the cleavage between common and different family environments.
The first group consists of families with a grandparent. In one family, this involves grandparent, parent and child. There are also 4 families with a grandparent and 1 to 5 grandchildren. The second group includes all families with parent-child constellations. A breakdown is presented on 2 levels: the upper level referring exclusively to parent-child constellations, the lower level to parentchild constellations plus additional family members such as aunts, uncles and cousins. This horizontal division tells us at a glance whether or not one or several family environments are involved for clinical and social evaluations. If the family is defined genetically, such a division is obviously pointless. In the light of predominating psychosocial concepts of family, which center attention on the dynamics of interaction in the family, it

seems valuable to elaborate on the dissimilarity of intra-familial environments in many of these families. This becomes evident when we turn our attention to those two families which have in common that both parents were Delaware State Hospital patients. One family consists of the parents, their son and 2 daughters. The mother was uninterruptedly hospitalized for over 30 years, remaining mute and totally unresponsive until her recent death. The father was recently admitted in a state of advanced senile psychosis. Being a frequent visitor to the hospital through 3 decades, he had been known to be a somewhat eccentric, selfcentered and suspicious person. Three of their 6 children developed schizophrenic psychoses. The son, continuously hospitalized since 1935, has been seclusive, apathetic and dominated by bizarre delusions of persecution. One daughter was first admitted at the age of 37. Though single, shy and given to irrational fears, she had steadily supported herself in domestic work, keeping her last job for 17 years. Her psychotic state was characterized by bizarre somatic and persecutory delusions with obvious hebephrenic features. She left the hospital after 5 months in markedly improved condition and has again been self-supporting for over three years. The other daughter, also single, was admitted at the age of 23 and readmitted 16 years later. Hospitalization lasted less than three years on both occasions. While self-supporting and fairly energetic, she has always displayed features of paranoid grandiosity which completely disrupted her capacity for realistic thinking during the two periods of hospitalization. Looking at this family, one may detect persuasive evidence for Lidz's hypothesis of "the transmission of irrationality." (Lidz, 1958)

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:25 08 December 2015

The other family consists of both parents, their daughter and the father's niece. The mother, a rather active, optimistic and friendly person, was hospitalized at the age of 56 for what appeared to be an involutional depression from which she recovered in S months. Her husband was admitted at the age of 83 with symptoms of cerebral arteriosclerosis. He died 2 months after admission. He had been a domineering and jealous individual who fluctuated between affection and intolerance for the problems of his wife and children. There were six children of whom two died in infancy. While 3 grew up normally, established themselves and have their own families, the oldest daughter was admitted at the age of 22. She has been continuously hospitalized since. During these years, she has remained apathetic, distant and oddly stereotypical in all of her activities. Her cousin, i.e. her father's niece, was admitted at the age of 22 in 1913.She remained continuously hospitalized until her death in January, 1958. She was the youngest of four children, all of whom are married and moderately successful in their personal lives. Her father was a quiet, determined and rather humorless man who seemed, however, devoted to his family. When close to 50 years, he lost his position and became discouraged and moody. He died at the age of 81. The mother impressed people as a harmonious person with varied social interests. She also died in her eighties. The schizophrenic daughter in this family stands out in my memory as the most absurdly deteriorated schizophrenic patient I have ever seen. Quiet, sensitive and somewhat self-conscious as a teenager, she became inconspicuously more passive and bizarre in thoughts and behavior as she approached the twenties. From the time of admission, she progressed to a state of total withdrawal

229
and assumed never-changing stereotypical postures. Invariably sitting in the same rigid position, she mumbled hardly audible and unintelligible syllables while grimacing, shaking her head and pulling her hair. During her 44 years of hospital existence, she depended on nursing care for survival. She finally died of bronchopneumonia and cachexia.
In contemplating the occurrence of schizophrenia in this family unit, we are struck with the existence of 2 totally dissimilar environments. Whatever deficiencies in family interaction may be assumed, will be of little relevance to the severity of the psychoses. Moreover, interpretations of the schizophrenic psychoses of these cousins in terms of "pseudo-heredity," attributable to "patterns of sharing and contagion" as postulated by Ehrenwald (1958), would make excessive demands on one's willingness to go beyond the limits of psychological common sense.
One family, listed under the constellation one parent-one child, actually includes a double feature, namely 2 cousins and their sons. This is an 8-member family unit with 3 schizophrenics. In as far as intrafamilial environments are concerned, we have to account for six markedly different sets. Families such as these may constitute the backbone of genetic theories; they should also be studied by those investigators who concentrate their attention too exclusively on analyzing symbiotic aspects.
In group 3 we find families which are represented by siblings, ranging from 2-5 in number. Siblings with additional relatives from collateral families are tabulated on the lower level. One of these sibling families, about which I reported previously, (Freyhan, 1951) consists of 4 schizophrenic siblings of whom 3 were brought up in this country while

230 Eugenics Quarterly

the fourth remained under the care of relatives in Poland when the family came to the United States before the first World War. She joined her family after the second World War, after 40 years of uninterrupted separation. Within a year after her arrival in this country, she was admitted to the Delaware State Hospital, as were one brother and 2 sisters from whom she had been apart through most of her life. Paranoid and catatonic features predominate in their psychotic states. We can find in this family an impressive array of genetic, psychodynamic and sociological aspects which I cannot explore in this presentation. In spite of important individual differences in the course of the psychoses, all 4 have been continuously hospitalized and must be regarded as therapeutic failures. Their exposure to totally different life situations must be a matter of considerable interest.
Only with difficulty can I resist the temptation to sketch several psychological portraits of these fascinating sibling families. But the question will be asked: "What about their parents and the family milieu from which they came?" I can only state categorically that the various aspects which are believed to be instrumental in the genesis of schizophrenia emerge from the study of these families in both: their significance and their limitations. The truly kaleidoscopic picture poses a challenge to all who tend to reduce etiological complexity to biological, psychosocial or psychoanalytical formulas. There are no apparent common denominators which lend support to monistic theories. Some of these siblings came from sick and disturbed families while others did not. In many instances, family relationships were found to be significantly pathological. Yet, in these same families, we may find a schizo-

phrenic cousin, aunt or uncle coming from what must in all fairness be considered average families. Lidz attributes great significance to the "training in irrationality" as a potent determinant in spreading schizophrenia in families (Lidz, 1958). His studies are based on 15 families with one hospitalized schizophrenic offspring. From a research point of view, some questions must arise with regard to his belief that "they form a good random sampling of middle- and upper-class families with schizophrenic offspring." Prout and White (1956) compared the early life experiences of schizophrenics with those of their healthy siblings. While finding no evidence that the schizophrenic patient suffered more trauma from poor environmental influence, they did find evidence that he reacted pathologically to ordinary changes. These authors concluded that their findings "suggest a radical change in therapeutic theory which has assumed that the illness has been a product of poor environmental influence, rather than an early pathological reaction to the environment on the part of the patient."
Irrational, schizoid and other pathological personalities predominate undoubtedly in families of schizophrenic patients. Psychosocial etiological concepts presuppose the existence of a pathological intra-familial environment in the families of all schizophrenic offspring. But the very obvious variation in the structure of family environments of the sibling families proves this to be a convenient oversimplification. I venture to say that if nothing would be known about genetic theories of schizophrenia, the feasibility of some predisposing factors would soon enough emerge as a compelling idea in the minds of those who investigate representative samples of schizophrenic families.

THERAPEUTIC ASSESSMENT
For the discussion of prognostic and therapeutic aspects, I offer an analysis of the developments which concern the 158 schizophrenic patients who were, or are, hospitalized at the Delaware State Hospital. These patients are divided into 8 cohorts. All but the last cohort include admissions during 8-year periods. All data pertain to each patient's status on 1/1/59. Each cohort is divided on the basis of single or multiple admissions.
The cohort analysis, as presented in Table IIIA, enables us to compare the developments in relation to different eras of therapeutic management. In a previous study, I presented an analysis of the total number of schizophrenic patients who were admitted to the Delaware State Hospital in the years 19001950 (Freyhan, 1958). This enables me to compare the family group with the

total sample of 1488 hospitalized schizophrenic patients.
The single admission column for each cohort is most apt to provide information on the best and worst prognostic aspects. These patients were admitted only once: to improve, leave and never to return; or to remain continuously hospitalized. Patients with multiple admissions either reached a sustained level of improvement and separation or required later continuous hospitalization. We observe a growing rate of separations, ranging from 20 per cent for the first cohort to over 50 per cent in the last two cohorts. The increasing size of the later cohorts would seem to be an indication of the growing number of total admissions over half a century. A comparison of this family sample of schizophrenics with the previously reported cohort data for the total population of hospitalized

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:25 08 December 2015

schizophrenics reveals the following differences. While in the total sample of 1488 schizophrenic patients multiple admissions increased in proportion to the growing number of separations, this does not hold true for the family cohorts. Secondly, and more significant, the proportion of total separations for the family sample is lower than that of the total sample. This suggests that the prognosis for the family schizophrenics is generally less favorable.
Table M B presents a distributional analysis of the major somatic therapies. Convulsive methods (at first Metrazol, then ECT), insulin treatment and psychosurgery, have been available at the Delaware State Hospital since 1938. Pharmacotherapy, which refers here exclusively, to neuroleptic treatment, commenced in 1954. As is evident, many of the patients admitted prior to the era of somatic therapies received one or several of these treatments during the later stages of their illness. For example, 42.3 per cent of the cohort admitted between 1924 and 1931 received one or several types of treatment. As would be expected, we find evidence of a considerable increase of therapeutic activities in all of the cohorts admitted since 1932. Electroconvulsive therapy maintains the first place in all but the last cohort in which pharmacotherapy surpasses by a slight margin. There is a decrease of insulin in the last cohort. None of the patients admitted since 1956 had psychosurgery. It should be pointed out, however, that psychosurgery has never been performed before all other therapeutic methods had been given a thorough trial. Many of the patients in the last 3 cohorts had psychotherapy. But differences in methods and extensiveness of treatment require a special analysis. Psychotherapy is, therefore, excluded since it does not lend itself to a comparative tabulation with

233
the more uniform somatic methods.
Before attempting to assess the potential influence of these treatments on the patients with whom we are here concerned, I must briefly refer to an analysis of general impact of somatic therapies on the group of schizophrenias. (Freyhan, 1958) The discrepancies between lifelong deterioration in some and temporary illness followed by lifelong readaptation in other schizophrenics induced Eugen Bleuler to develop the concept of the group of schizophrenias. Common clinical manifestations on one hand, and consistent differences in prognostic patterns on the other, suggest the existence of particular groups within empirically established generic boundaries. Evaluations of the effectiveness of therapeutic methods must take these differential patterns into consideration.
Bleuler's group concept finds support in the analysis of the total schizophrenic population admitted to the Delaware State Hospital between 1900 and 1950.
What is evident, at least clinically, is the fact that schizophrenia manifests itself as a temporary, a recurring and a progressive disorder. Modern treatments have greatly enhanced the chances for clinical improvement, hospital separation and adequate social readaptation.
This is not to ignore the fact that social attitudes toward schizophrenic patients have also undergone a profound change which favor more permissive discharge policies. Thus, both modern therapeutic methods and increased social tolerance of schizophrenic individuals have been effective in speeding up the separations from the hospital. But while mortality of hospitalized schizophrenics has drastically diminished, and while the more chaotic aspects of psychotic behavior have yielded to therapeutic modification, there remains the distressing fact of

therapeutic failure in about one-third of all schizophrenic patients. A direct influence on the prognosis cannot be ascertained since we lack sufficient knowledge about the natural history of schizophrenic psychoses. On the basis of available evidence, there is a group with a favorable as well as one with an unfavorable prognosis. Modern treatments have neither produced the former nor, however, eliminated the latter.
A therapeutic assessment is undertaken in Table IV. Each cohort has been divided into 3 bars: one for separated, one for hospitalized and one for deceased patients. Superimposed on each of these bars is a breakdown of therapeutic activities. It is not intended to evaluate the relative merits of each therapeutic modality. What seems important here, is to relate therapeutic activity in terms of single or multiple treatments, or the absence of treatment, to patterns of course and outcome. That it is not easy to establish correlations between therapeutic activities and favorable or unfavorable groups is indicated by the 19401947 cohort which shows an equal distribution of therapeutic activities in separated and hospitalized patients. Chronicity, it seems, is not a matter of lack of, but resistiveness to, treatment. Nor is there any doubt that patients get well without somatic treatments, now as well as in the past. But it cannot be sufficiently stressed that an unknown number of patients owe improvement or social recovery to treatment alone. The speedy interruption of acute disturbances, made possible by somatic treatments and pharmacotherapy in particular, has profoundly changed the adaptive patterns of schizophrenic patients. If and when effective, somatic therapies drastically shorten the patient's experiential exposure to psychotic ideation. The therapeutically induced modification or elimi-

235
nation of psychotic experiencing protects patients from surrendering to unreality which in the past, by the very fact of its prolonged existence, contributed substantially toward social deterioration.
Schizophrenic families present a therapeutic challenge. The mere fact of multiple occurrence of schizophrenia in a family may arouse unwarranted therapeutic pessimism. But is may also unleash a furor therapeuticus, directed at entire family units. The still prevailing reluctance to acknowledge any influence of genetic factors, reflects an irrational fear of therapeutic nihilism. That this is an irrational fear, which is neither in accordance with genetic theory nor with clinical experience, has been stressed by Kallmann and others time and again. The denial of genetic factors in the etiology of schizophrenia has, however, stimulated an immense revival of human and psychological interest in schizophrenic patients. The image of the schizophrenic as a person afflicted with somatic illness has been replaced by the image of the schizophrenic as a victim of pathogenetic parents. We are all familiar with the slogan: "You cannot treat a schizophrenic without treating the pathological environment from which he comes." What must remain questionable, is the therapeutic wisdom of collective family treatment. If therapeutic teams, i.e. psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker and counsellor, proceed as a matter of course to disentangle what are conceivably pathological family relationships, the results may prove to be more traumatic than beneficial.
There is every evidence that families with schizophrenia show individual textures of intra-familial environments as well as great divergency of prognostic potentialities. Table V illustrates the degree of prognostic variation which divides families in those with predomi-

nantly favorable and unfavorable prognoses. The degree of favorableness is measured in terms of specified time periods which have passed since the patient's last separation from the hospital. Conversely, unfavorableness is measured in terms of equal time spans of continuous hospitalization since last admission. As is evident, there are families with very favorable and very unfavorable prognoses. There are 25 families in which all individual members, and 6 families in which the majority of individual members, show an unfavorable reaction pattern. By contrast, there are 9 families in which all individual members, and 3 families in which the majority of individual members, show a favorable reaction pattern. We can now conclude that the substantial numbers of families with unfavorable prognoses account for the generally less favorable results in the family material as compared with the total schizophrenic population to which I referred. From the therapeutic point of view, then, there is this important evidence of inter-familial as well as intrafamilial prognostic variation.
I am convinced that individualization of treatment should be the guiding principle. The therapeutic and prognostic potentialities of individual schizophrenic patients cannot be anticipated. Prognoses still cannot be made predictively but are retrospective statements of factual developments. No therapeutic regime, somatic or psychological, can be directed at schizophrenia. The therapeutic process depends on the conceptualization of strata of therapeutic targets, which are susceptible to selective somatic or psychological therapies. Perhaps the greatest therapeutic fallacy has been the arbi-

trary division into symptomatic and curative therapies. In the absence of confirmed knowledge on the etiology of schizophrenia, no therapy can take the credit of being more profound than another. If therapeutic methods effect changes in affective and sodal behavior by eliminating disturbances which, while far from being the "cause" or the "process" of the illness, prevent improvement, then we can gratefully acknowledge the reintegrative effects of available therapeutic measures.
Modern treatment methods have changed the clinical profile of schizophrenia. The schizophrenic of today tends to be a more sociable individual than the withdrawn and secluded patient of yesterday. Whether, in the context of this symposium on mating and fertility trends, you will consider this transformation as a therapeutic achievement or as a genetic liability, will be, I feel certain, a most dilemmatic decision.
