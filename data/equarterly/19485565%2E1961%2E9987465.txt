SOME DATA ON NATURAL FERTILITY

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:26 08 December 2015

Louis HENRY

W.E CAN term as natural the fertility
which exists or has existed in the absence of deliberate birth control. The adjective "natural" is admittedly not ideal but we prefer it to "physiological" since the factors affecting natural fertility are not solely physiological: social factors may also play a part--sexual taboos, for example, during lactation. Some of these factors may result in a reduction of fertility but this cannot be considered a form of birth control. Control can be said to exist when the behavior of the couple is bound to the number of children already born and is modified when this number reaches the maximum which the couple does not want to exceed; it is not the case for a taboo concerning lactation, which is independent of the number of children already born.
It is no easy task to collect data on natural fertility, thus defined. One is confronted in fact with two difficulties.
First of all, populations have to be found where birth control is not practiced, or populations where control is so limited that it does not effectively modify fertility. The latter condition would appear to be less restrictive but actually it is very difficult to be certain that a given population fulfills these requirements. In the great majority of cases, one simply forms a hypothesis based on considerations of time, place, thought, culture, type of society, etc. Thus one comes to adjudge as sufficiently approximating to natural fertility the fertility found in the rural population of Europe

or in peoples of European origin before a certain date, which itself varies from one country to another and, within one country, from one region to another. In the case of France, the date is usually fixed between 1750 and 1790; for other countries, 1880 is about the earliest date that can be cited. Urban populations are more difficult to place, but most difficult of all are the governing classes about whom it seems to be impossible to make an evaluation without a preliminary study of the development of their fertility. Such a study, carried out on the governing classes of Geneva, indicated that fertility was close, even very close, to natural fertility in the generations born before 1650, but a study of the French aristocracy living at Court did not reveal a similar situation; perhaps it would be found if it were possible to go further back in time.
For non-European populations there is often strong evidence to suggest virtually complete absence of birth control, either for the immediate past or up to the present. This evidence is further reinforced by studies showing that the very idea of limiting births is more or less foreign to them.
The second difficulty lies in the collection of data, for, excluding the Hutterites of the United States and Canada, the populations which presumably did not or do not pratice birth control were either premodern or inhabit countries where demographic statistics are not developed and are of poor quality.

rial efforts are needed to collect relevant data on the fertility of these populations, and they have only been made in recent years; just ten years ago very few data were available. Since then, however, the situation has considerably improved thanks to the work of historical demographers on the one hand, and fairly numerous studies of the underdeveloped countries on the other.
The term "fertility" can be interpreted in several ways: it can be used to designate a demographic characteristic which is affected by marriage rates, and legitimate and illegitimate birth rates. This composite, or general, fertility is not well suited for analytical, and is even less suited for comparative, purposes because of the variety of situations possible within the state of marriage.
A more valid comparison can be made by restricting the study to legitimate birth rates, or the equivalent; that is, the fertility of women who have formed a union which is stable enough for them to be considered as exposed to the same risk as married women. Moreover, the age of the woman has to be taken into account as that also plays an important part. In other words, rates for legitimate births by age or age group must be formulated.
In populations where birth control is widely practiced these rates are of real interest only if women are classified by age or age group at marriage; the number of children born at the time of the study, and therefore the duration of the marriage--or the difference between the age at the time of the study and the age at marriage -- then have an important bearing on the case. But it is a different matter where birth control is absent or little practiced. In Taiwan, India and in the majority of populations of traditional, rural societies for which it has

been possible to deduce the age at mar-
riage, it has been established, by study-
ing a group of women of the same age,
that fertility was more or less independent of the age at marriage.1'2
One can proceed, therefore, to the
stage of making comparisons without in-
troducing the age at marriage; it is in
fact an advantage since in the underde-
veloped countries the age is rarely known.
The 15-19 age group must be excluded,
however. This group is always close to
marriage (see footnote 2); on the other
hand, and this is the more important
point, fertility increases rapidly with age
before 18 or 20, with the result that the
fertility of the 20-24 age group de-
pends on the average age at marriage
of those women married before 20; and
this age may vary considerably from one population to another.3
Since fertility measured by age group
does not depend on the age at marriage,
at least after the age of 20 or thereabouts,
the sum of the age-specific fertility rates
multiplied by 5 equals the mean number
of children, discounting mortality, per woman married at 20.4> 5 This mean
number constitutes a sort of guide-mark
for the legitimate fertility level of the
1Canada forms an exception (marriages from 1700-1729), but certain anomalies lead us to suppose that the connection between fertility and the age at marriage is only apparent.
2Theoretically this is true only after a sufficient number of years of marriage have passed for the fluctuations in fertility at the beginning of the marriage to have been levelled out. Calculating by age group renders this condition unimportant.
3No difficulties are resolved by working from the exact age, for the reservations expressed in footnote 2 then demonstrate their full force.
4The multiple 5 is used because the rates by age group represent the average for 5-year periods.
5This average number differs very little from what can be observed in the completed families of women married at 20 years, because the connection between fertility and mortality is in fact slight.

age groups from 20 to 50 years. As such
it can be used to classify populations ac-
cording to their fertility.
This is what has been done in Table
1, which gives for different populations a
series of legitimate fertility rates from
the 20-24 age group to the 45-49 age
group, and the average number of chil-
dren per woman married at 20 corre-
sponding to each series. The populations
considered are listed in descending order
of the average number of children. In
the right-hand column, the indices are
listed: the arithmetic mean of the rates
for the two groups 30-34 and 35-39, and
likewise of the two groups 40-44 and 45-
49, has been computed and compared
with the arithmetic mean, taken as base
100, of the 20-24 and 25-29 groups. This
has been done for each population.
The index of mean rates for women in
the 30-39 age group ranges from 67
(Fouta-Djalon) to 89 (Canada) but of a
total of 13 series, 9 fall within the range
76 to 81.
The index of mean rates for women in
the 40-49 age group ranges from 14.5
(Sotteville-les-Rouen) to 28.5 (Norway)
and there are only 6 series within the 17-
22 range; the relative dispersion is far
more marked than in the former group.
But the difference is partly apparent and
can be attributed to errors in recording
age and to random fluctuations; both
factors carry more weight for the 40-49 age group than for the 30-39 group.6
6Difficulty in determining age is most often encountered in underdeveloped countries. The age group defined as 45-49 always includes women who are in fact younger and consequently a fertility rate which appears to be too high is obtained. The inclusion of women older than their stated age has only a slight compensatory effect since fertility in the 45-49 age group is almost nonexistent.
Among traditional societies, either European or of European origin, the age can be precisely reckoned, or calculated from the age at death. In this latter case, one runs the same risk as above.

Despite the dispersion, there does exist some similarity between the different series: they have only to be compared with the series of rates for a population where birth control is widely practiced (last line of Table 1) for this to be obvious. Therefore they can all be included in a general description when examining the average of the rates; a series that is more evenly graded than any of the component series is thus obtained. Taking the fertility of the 20-24 age group as base 100, the rates are as follows: 25-29 years, 93.5; 30-34 years, 85.3; 35-39 years, 68.7; 40-44 years, 34.9; and 45-49 years, 5.
Table 2 compares this average series of indices with that of a population where birth control is widely practiced. The first line remains fairly steady up to about 35 years and then drops sharply. The second line shows a typical decline--from one age group to the next, the fertility rate is almost halved.
Sterility. All or nearly all couples are sterile by the time the woman is 50 years old; this fact sufficiently explains why fertility at 50+ is nil. But as the onset of menopause occurs at varying ages, the proportion of sterile couples inevitably increases with the age of the woman; the same is true of the proportion of women who become sterile by accident, as the result of a confinement, for example. The progression of secondary sterility,7 whether it be natural or pathological, as the woman grows older is therefore a factor in the reduction of fertility. But this is not necessarily the only factor, for the fertility of couples who are still fecund can also be a reducing factor if this fertility decreases as the age of the woman rises.
7Secondary sterility, as opposed to "primary sterility," arises after one or more children have been born (cf. Multilingual Demographic Dictionary, published by the U.N., p. 38).

The frequency of absolute sterility (primary and secondary) cannot be measured directly since the only observable phenomenon is infertility from a certain age. But because a married woman has been infertile since, let us say, the age of 40, it does not necessarily follow that she was sterile at 40; she has simply become so before having conceived again. Absolute sterility is less frequently found, therefore, than infertility. The former can only be measured from evidence of the latter, a method which is acceptable since sterility does not progress very quickly, at least not up to about the age of 40. From then on, one should proceed cautiously, fully aware of the risks of error entailed in such an undertaking.
Table 3 lists some approximate figures of the proportion of absolutely sterile couples according to the age of the woman.
All these different series show a low figure for women aged 20, 3% being the

figure most often found, and also the over-all average. Then the percentages increase at varying rates of progression. But perhaps one should not attach too much importance to the differences between the European populations cited, as they can be attributed to errors in age, random fluctuations and the difficulties inherent in this type of calculation. The average series adequately depicts the general development.
The series for Japan is the only one that may be relevant for a non-European population. The rise in the sterility rates as the woman grows older is markedly steeper than for the other populations. The question arises as to whether this difference is peculiar to Japan or whether it would be found in other non-European populations. At present, it is impossible to answer this.
The proportion of fecund couples is the complement of the proportion of sterile couples; the product of the former multiplied by the fertility of the

86 Henry

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:26 08 December 2015

fecund couples equals the fertility of the total of both groups.
Let us take as the percentage of fecund couples in one age group, the mean of the highest and lowest figures:
95.5 f 9 7 + 9 4 ) for the 20-24 age group,
for example; the percentage for this group is then expressed as base 100 and the indices in Table 4 are obtained for the average of the European populations and for Japan.
These two series present the same general appearance; the reduction in percentage of fecund couples is accelerated with age, giving a sharply downward trend towards the oldest age group.
In order better to understand the significance of this outline, let us suppose for a moment that sterility were an accidental risk independent of age and affecting s% of all women confined. If, out of 1,000 women fecund at the beginning of the year, / gave birth in that year, there would only be 1,000 (l-fs) fecund at the end of that year. Even if the value of / changes fairly gradually with age, the proportion of fecund married women would still be 1,000 (1-fs)2 at the end of the following year, and so on. This series of proportions forms an outline which decreases as age increases during the first years and then flattens out, quite the contrary from what can actually be observed. Consequently the exposure to the risk of sterility caused by a confinement cannot be considered both important and independent of age. If the risk is considered an important factor, it must carry progressively more weight as age increases; alternatively, if the risk is considered independent of age, it is negligible.
The change in the proportion of fecund couples as the woman grows older

is analogous to the change in the fertility rates of the total number of couples. The fertility rate of fecund couples is the other factor which affects the fertility rate of the total number of couples and which must now be examined. As this rate cannot be directly observed, one takes as a substitute the fertility rate of couples who later prove to be fertile, that is to say, fertile after the woman has exceeded the upper limit of the age group to which she belongs at the time of the survey (after the 30th birthday, for example, for women in the 25-29 age group) .8
In each of the series (Table 5) there is a tendency for the figures to decrease as the age of the woman rises, though the rate of the reduction varies. Since the difference is at least partially due to sampling at random from a small number of cases, the mean rates give a better indication of the general picture.
The mean series of indices differs little from the series for percentage of fecund couples. Although the two series are not based on exactly the same groups of populations, the similarity does suggest that the decrease in the fertility of all the couples could be attributed to two factors of more or less equal importance: .the reduction in the percentage of fecund couples and the reduction in the fertility of these couples.
The fertility rate of fecund couples is approximately equal to the inverse of the average of those intervals where the beginning or the end, or both, fall in the age group under consideration. The reduction in the fertility of fecund couples means that as the woman gets older so
8When calculating by age groups, the bias inherent in this method can be discounted up to at least the age of 40 as rates for couples who are later fertile are undoubtedly very similar to those for fecund couples.

births become more widely spaced. Thus, taking the mean series, the spacing goes from 24 months approximately for the 20-24 age group, to 25 months for the 2529 age group, 27 months for the 30-34 age group, and 31 months for the 35-39 age group.
The same phenomenon can be observed within the family in a more abrupt form: the intervals between each child at first increase only gradually, but with the penultimate child and even more so with the last child, the gap becomes very much wider.
One can conclude from the progressive reduction in the fertility rates of fecund couples either that the wider spacing of children noted within the family takes place after the woman has passed the age of 40, or, and this is the more likely, that the ages where this lengthening of the interval takes place are sufficiently widely spread to annul the effect of the very rapid change noted within the family.
Let us now return to Table 1. The total of the fertility rates multiplied by 5 gives, approximately, the mean num-

ber of children per completed family of

a woman married at exactly 20; a com-

parison between this number and the

average fertility rate for the 20-29 age

group (subtotal of the 20-24 and 25-29

age group rates) shows that the mean

number of children per completed fam-

ily of a woman married at 20 years old

is twenty times greater than the mean

fertility rate for the 20-29 age group. In

other words, the number of children is

the same as it would be if the level of

fertility found among women of about

25 remained constant from 20 to 40 years,

and then ceased completely after the

40th birthday.

The average number of children per

completed family for women married at

45, 40, 35, 30, 25, and 20 years old can be

obtained by adding the fertility rates in

descending age group order and multi-

plying by 5. The average number of

children thus calculated, using the mean

of the 13 rates shown in Table 1, is an

approximate linear function of the age

at marriage when the age varies from 20

to 30, or even 35 years, as Table 6 dem-

onstrates.

When plotted with age along the horizontal axis, the line expressing the average number of children declines to zero when the age at marriage is about 40. Thus an empirical result is reached analogous to the preceding conclusion: the mean number of children per completed family of a woman married between the ages of 20 and 35 equals the fertility rate for women of about 25, times the number of years between the age at marriage and 40 years.
So far, our efforts have been directed towards an exposition of the characteristics common to several series of legitimate fertility rates computed from populations not practicing birth control; now we must turn our attention to another essential fact: the level of fertility differs from one population to another. The highest level of fertility at about 25 years is 1.72 times greater than the lowest; the largest average number of children per completed family of a woman married at 20 is 1.76 times higher than the lowest average number. Thus, within the limits of the definition "natural fertility," and despite the similarity between one population and another in the pattern of legitimate fertility as it varies according to the age of the woman, the levels of fertility are very different. This can, of course, only be stated with qualifications, but as a simplified generalization it is useful for the purposes of examining the very important differences in level that have been established.
Before going any further, it would be well to anticipate the question of whether

this difference really exists. The majority of figures relating to European populations, whether by origin or actual residence, and whether of modern or premodern societies, are subject to only minor errors; data on Taiwan are considered reliable thanks to the high standard of the system of registration instituted by the Japanese and to the checks carried out during the survey. The figures from Iran seem to be acceptable since, when applied to Muslim populations of the Mediterranean coast, they give birth rates which have been observed or evaluated by other means. The rates for India and Guinea are more open to question; the Indian series is undoubtedly characteristic of numerous surveys carried out there, but all the results seem to be flawed by more or less similar inaccuracies. The rates for Guinea are calculated from the births declared during the twelve months preceding the 1954-55 survey. But the average number of children per woman calculated from this series is considerably higher than the number stated by the women. On the other hand, as some of the children had just passed their first birthday, they had probably been counted as under one year old. There are then good reasons to believe that the rates observed are no lower than the real figures.
The differences observed, therefore, must be allowed to exist in fact, with the conclusion that there are very marked variations in fertility among popula-

tions even in the absence of birth control.9
Furthermore, nearly all the European populations observed show fertility rates that exceed those of the non-European populations. This result may seem surprising since the crude birth rate of nonEuropean populations is in general higher than that of premodern European populations. But these rates, although very high, are still quite compatible with a legitimate fertility lower than that of premodern Europe, for among non-European populations fewer people remain single and the age at marriage is lower than among Western peoples; this is true both for the past and today. If this combination of high marriage rates and early age at marriage were accompanied by a legitimate fertility rate as high as that of premodern Europe, the birth rates would be raised even more and would reach figures that apparently have never been observed, even after correcting errors in registration.
Finally, the cause must be sought for these marked differences in fertility. A priori, it might be assumed that they are attributable to one of the two prime factors governing fertility: the proportion of fecund couples and the fertility of these couples.
The first can be quickly eliminated: the proportion of fecund couples where the woman is in her 20's varies only from 92% to 95.5% among the several European populations cited in Table 3. Japan admittedly shows a lower percentage, 88%, but the difference between this figure and those quoted for European populations is much slighter than the
9One European population with low natural fertility can moreover be cited--the Swedish parishes of Estonia studied by H. Hyrenius. This case does, however, appear to be an exception in Europe.

differences in the average fertility rates for the 20-29 age group.
The percentages by age of fecund women for the other populations is not known, but reliable figures are available showing the proportion of childless women who have reached or passed the age of menopause. It is 4% in Taiwan, for example, and about 7% for FoutaDjalon. Considering the age at which women marry in these populations, figures such as these represent an upper limit to the frequency of sterility among couples where the woman is about 20 years old. But if 96% or even 93% of married women are fecund at 20, the percentage cannot drop to a figure as low as from 60%-70% for women of about 25; yet this low figure would be required to account for the differences observed in the fertility rates.
The differences are the consequence, then, of birth spacing; this is already apparent among European populations where the fertility rates of fecund couples, and consequently the mean intervals between births, show striking differences from population to population. For Taiwan, there is evidence pointing to intervals in the region of 2.7 years. In India, mean intervals in the region of 3 years have been found in surveys where the fertility rates are as high as those cited in Table 1.
We thus reach, whether directly or indirectly, the following conclusions.
First, marked differences in fertility do exist among populations where birth control is either unknown or very little practiced. As the incidence of absolute sterility is, at least among the younger age groups, similar from one population to another, the differences, for these younger groups, can be largely attributed to variations in the spacing of births by fertile couples.

Second, although the differences appear among European populations, they are far more striking when European populations are compared with nonEuropean; on the whole, the former space births far less than the latter.
The spacing of live births depends on several factors.
(1) The length of time that elapses between conception and either the resumption of sexual relations or the reappearance of ovulation, whichever occurs later after the confinement. This period can, though it is exceptional, be prolonged by temporary pathological sterility. A new conception is impossible during this "idle" period.
(2) Fecundability, or the probability of conception, outside the "idle" period defined above, measured by the menstrual cycle, or more simply by months.
(3) The frequency of miscarriages and still births.
It seems unlikely that the third factor can vary sufficiently to explain the differences that have been established. Rather, research on the populations of Geneva and Crulai seems to indicate that within one population the differences in the fertility of couples are largely due to variations in the length of the "idle" period. This finding has led us to formulate the hypothesis that differences between populations can be attributed to the same cause: that, in average, the resumption of sexual relations or the reappearance of ovulation occur at different times, later among some populations than others.
This hypothesis is borne out by the delay in the resumption of sexual relations imposed by the prohibition, among some populations, of relations during at least a great part of the lactatory period. These taboos are common in black Africa, but they do not exist among Mus-

lim populations of the Mediterranean coast. In Europe, there were no such taboos, though traces can be found of popular beliefs which might have postponed the resumption of sexual relations; but the influence of these beliefs must have been considerably limited in numerous places by monogamy and the strictness of social mores.
The power of sexual taboos among the Africans is often quoted, and it seems to us rightly so, for it is known that they are very widespread in black Africa and it is generally considered that fertility is lower there than in any other region where birth control is not practiced. But, in fact, the taboos are not a complete explanation of fertility differences. On the one hand, they are unknown among certain African populations, the Ashanti of Ghana, for example, whose fertility rate, moreover, is very similar to that of other African populations. On the other hand, the problem is not simply one of the differences between Africa and the rest of the world, but of differences among many populations of which only some are African.
In order to maintain our hypothesis, then, we must also allow that the reappearance of ovulation after confinement occurs later among some populations than others. Since there is a relationship between ovulation and breast feeding, it might be thought that variation in the length of the suckling period from one population to another would account for the greater or lesser delay in the resumption of ovulation. But another explanation can be put forward: the relation between the lactatory and the anovulatory periods, whether of shorter or longer duration, is by no means constant. Ovulation is resumed very rapidly among some women even though they are suckling their babies.

With others some time elapses after confinement before it is resumed but still before the infant is weaned; and with still others, it is resumed only after weaning. In other words, women who breast feed for thesame length of time can be divided into different categories according to the length of the anovulatory period. It is possible that therelative importance of each of these categories varies to a measurable degree from one population to another, and in these variations could be found at least a partial explanation for the differences noted in natural fertility.
Finally, the hypothesis by which populations may be differentiated according to the"idle" period, during which conception is impossible, leads us to distinguish between two explanations for the differences: first, differences in behavior relating to the resumption of sexual relations and the duration ofthe suckling period; andsecond, differences of a physiological nature relating to frequency and duration of anovulation during the suckling period.
To accept the second explanation is to admit that this physiological characteristic can be included among those which, for reasons of heredity or environment, vary from one population to another. Research in this field would help us to understand why there exist among populations such differences in natural fertility.
