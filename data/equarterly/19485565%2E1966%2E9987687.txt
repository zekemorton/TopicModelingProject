PILOT STUDY: POPULATION DIFFERENCES IN THE FREQUENCY OF SPINA BIFIDA OCCULTA

INTRODUCTION
The higher frequencies of abnormal nasal septa reported among six longcivilized populations, as contrasted with lower frequencies among sixteen samples of "hunters and gatherers" based upon examinations of some 2,354 skulls (Post, 1966), raises the question of what other genetically conditioned growth abnormalities of the skeleton might have higher frequencies among populations with relatively longer histories of civilization. Clefts and bifurcations in the spinous processes of vertebra were investigated since they resemble nasal septa in consisting of symmetrically paired (left and right) laminae of bone which manifest abnormal growth resulting from altered speeds of ossification, whether unilaterally or bilaterally. The spinous processes of vertebrae, entirely cartilaginous at birth, normally become ossified slowly during childhood, but cases of arrested or retarded bone formation are fairly common. Bifidity of the cartilage in the newborn must be considered separately from that of the adult skeleton.
Congenital spina bifida (with or without meningocoele) is the most serious and the most frequent anomaly of the spine, occurring once per 775 births in the United States (Neel, 1958). The only large non-Caucasian population for which reliable data are available is that of Japan, where the rates are markedly low:

Overall, congenital (Neel, 1958)

Japanese (113,441 births) .00021 Caucasians (120,101 births) .00129

These differences are significant at the .001 level.
A list of rates of congenital spina bifida among 24 Caucasian populations is given by Lamy and Fre'zal (1961, Table 3, pp. 41-42). They vary between .00016 and .00430, with median .0011 and mean .0014. Milder cases must be many times more frequent than those reported.
The anomaly is associated with several environmental factors, including geographical location, socioeconomic level, and primiparity ("primogeniture"). It is also conditioned genetically, a multifactorial hypothesis appearing to be tenable. Williamson (1965) also suggests

341

a familial maternal factor. She calculates a genetic risk of 1:20 (6 affected among 120 sibs) among sibs of affected propositi and of 1:18 (9 among 160) after pooling spina bifida with anencephaly, a closely related congenital abnormality.
The analogy between developmental abnormalities of nasal septa and of vertebral spines in adults hardly applies to congenital spina bifida, which involves cartilaginous and nervous tissues prior to ossification. Nevertheless, the population differences which are considered most reliable are reviewed for the sake of completeness.
In adults the external manifestations of marked clefts in vertebral spines and spina bifida occulta include localized hypertrichosis, areas of hyperpigmentation, scarring, and areas of visible or palpable swelling. These occur occasionally without spina bifida occulta. Indeed, the reported correlation is not high (Schmorl and Junghanns, 1959, p. 36). Nevertheless, it may be that correlation among populations is of significance--that is, populations with higher frequencies of spina bifida, whether overt or occult, may also have higher frequencies of the symptoms, and vice versa. It might be worthwhile to investigate this question and to note especially the cultural history of each population? particularly, the length of time each population has spent in each cultural or ecological habitat.
Family histories of spina bifida in adults are reported by Morris (1957); diagnosis and problems are reviewed by Hoffman (1965).
Published data on the population frequencies of spina bifida from skeletal material of adults are limited to the Caucasian race, and to the lowest lumbar and/or first sacral vertebra. For these two vertebra the frequency of open (nonfused) spines was reported by Hintze

(1922) as 81% at age 5, 44% at 15, and 10% at 50. At age 24 three authors have reported frequencies of 16%, 22% and 24% (Schmorl, 1959, p. 36). Eleven other authors have reported frequencies from 3.6% to 48%, without specifying age, median and the mean frequency both being about 24% (Hanraets, 1959, p. 97). These estimates are not comparable with estimates of frequencies at birth, which are based on clinical cases, all of marked severity.
Spina bifida is apparently rare among the other primates, only one case having been found in the literature--incomplete dorsal arches of the first and second sacral vertebra in an adult orang, wild-shot (Schultz, 1956, p. 994, Fig. 14-1). Examination of the several score skeletons of higher primates at the U.S. National Museum and the Chicago Museum of Natural History revealed another case--total absence of the spine of the first sacral vertebra, with hernia into the nerve canal, in an adult wildshot gorilla (number 220,060, USNM).
An extraordinarily high frequency of spina bifida was found by Ferembach (1963) among 21 epipaleolithic sacra in Morocco with carbon-I4 age of 10,500 to 12,070 years. Only 5 were normal, the others showing perforation or hiatus at one point or another. Of 15 specimens of the first sacral vertebra, 4 showed deciscence.
Skeletal collections can hardly be held to represent unbiased samples of populations,, particularly for an abnormal condition such as spina bifida. Severe cases must be eliminated by young deaths more frequently in some environments than in others, depending upon the varying degrees of stress, particularly those imposed by activities and occupation, etc. Even mild cases must be eliminated differentially, for example, more frequently in populations lacking

medical aid than in modern "civilized" populations. The variation of selection pressures at all ages which affect different collections of skeletons must be very great, viz., poorhouse cadavers vs. village cemetery material.
These considerations would not apply to the very mildest manifestations of spina bifida. Clefts and shallow bifurcations in the sagittal plane of the dorsal surface of the spine could hardly be subject to selection. Yet their frequency in a population sample might be taken as an estimate of the frequency of the same polygenes which produce frank, overt spina bifida in persons inheriting a number of them. It might be worthwhile to test the several component parts of this assumption.
The purposes of the present project are (a) to review the heritability of spina bifida in the newborn and in adults, and to investigate the heritability of shallow clefts and bifurcations of vertebral spines of adults; (b) to test the hypothesis that shallow clefts and bifurcations are mild manifestations of clinical spina bifida; and (c) to obtain estimates of the frequencies of clefts, bifurcations, and mild cases of spina bifida occulta among several populations of two classes--those with long and those with short histories of "civilization."
A small beginning has been made towards the third objective in the present pilot study.
MATERIAL
Spinal columns of 185 male skeletons, 93 designated "Negro" and 92 "white," were examined at the Hamann Museum collection of Western Reserve University Medical School, Cleveland. All are from "poorhouse" cadavers. The white sample (mean age 44.7, S.D. 14.2) is seven years older than the Negro (mean 37.7, S.D. 3.5) and far more variable in age.

From the Terry Anatomical Collection of the Anatomy Department of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis the spines of 103 "Negro" and 107 "White" male skeletons, also macerated from "poorhouse" cadavers, were examined. These whites also were older (mean age 47.1, S.D. 7.6) than the Negroes (mean 41.5, S.D. 9.1). In both collections care was taken not to know the race of a skeleton until the examination was complete.
Spines of samples of four cemetery populations were examined at the Physical Anthropology Division of the U.S. National Museum: Australian aborigines, Illinois Indians and Arikara Indians (from mound burials), and Chinese males from Canton who had died in Alaska.
Sacra were examined in five additional samples at the U.S. National Museum, Smithsonian Institution, Washington: 12 Eskimos from St. Lawrence Island, 55 American Indians with hunting cultures (18 from Illinois, 20 from Kansas, 17 from Oregon), 83 ancient Egyptians of the XII dynasty, 94 Aleutian Islanders (55 from a cave buried on Kagamil Island, the rest from mixed sites), and 173 ancient Peruvians from cemeteries near Chicama (north coast). Estimates of age and sex were noted.
The following five classification categories are used for cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spines:
Designation
n normal--rounded, symmetrical, without cleft.
cl cleft--a vertical groove on dorsal surface in sagittal plane sufficiently clear to demark the left and right elements. Occasionally, clefts extended from top to bottom of the dorsal surface, but most clefts were

344 Post Eugen. Quart.

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:29 08 December 2015

confined to the bottom, extending only part way up. b bifurcation--a deep cleft, distinguishing right and left elements quite clearly from top to bottom. mb marked bifurcation--separation of right and left elements. asy asymmetry--left or right element obviously larger than its opposite element, in a restricted area or throughout the dorsal surface of the spine.
Sacral spines are classified by separate categories since their variation is different in type and greater in degree:
Designation n symmetrical and normal
spine sms sym., small spine Is sym.; large spine cl sym.; cleavage b sym.; bifurcation mb sym.; marked bifurcation asy.; tw. asymmetric or "twisted" masy. markedly asymmetric L ditto; left element above
right R ditto; right element above
left fcl bifid; closed--no opening
into canal (whether symmetrical or not) f|O bifid; half open fo bifid; open fh bifid; hiatus or hernia in midline
CERVICAL REGION
Racial variation is of particular interest in only five cervical spines, C-2 through C-6, since G-l and C-7 are almost never cleft. (C-l is frequently

overtly bifid, but mild clefts are extremely rare.)
Cunningham (1886, p. 639) recorded the cases of bifid spine in the cervical vertebra of very small samples of two contrasted populations. He found no deft in the atlas or the last two cervicals.

Six well-known and reliable authors have stated categorically that terminal bifurcation of the four cervical spines, C-2 through C-5, is relatively less pronounced and less frequent among various non-European races (LeDouble, 1912, p. 47; Mijsberg, 1928, p. 474; Martin, 1928, p. 1083; Shore, 1931, p. 499; Lanier, 1939, p. 407; Patte, 1955, pp. 286-287). In contrast, cervical spines of Neanderthal skeletons found in Europe are less

frequently bifid in all regions than those of modern Europeans (Patte, 1955).
A review of frequencies of cleft and bifurcated cervical spines in samples of eighteen populations is presented in Table 1, pooling the various degrees of cleavage. The eight samples of Asians and Europeans have in general higher frequencies than the eight samples with shorter histories of civilization. This dichotomy appears highly significant, but, since the classifications are subjective and the classes arbitrary, no chi square has been computed.
Data of the present study of W.R.U.

Negro and white male skeletons are

shown in Table 1-A (discrepancies in

number are due to "missing" vertebrate).

ficant for each of these five vertebrae at

whites, but whites exceed Negroes in the frequencies of bifurcations, and still more in marked bifurcations, which vary from 6 to 13 cases among the five vertebra in the white sample, while the Negro sample contains not one case.
Similar results were obtained from the Terry collection.
THORACIC AND LUMBAR REGIONS
Although spina bifida is no less frequent in thoracic and lumbar spines than in cervicals, population comparisons among non-Europeans are most rare. Shore's investigation (1930, p. 221) of 82 Bantu skeletons revealed 23 bifid spines--5 cervical, 9 thoracic, 3 lumbar, and 6 sacral. These are from dissecting room cadavers, said to be "quite representative of the Bantu native race," sex and age unstated. Willis (1923) reported three Negro and six white cases, all of the lowest lumbar vertebra, among 748 male spines in the Hamann Museum collection at Western Reserve Medical School, which are approximately half Negro and half white, but he does not give the racial composition of the 748 skeletons. Stewart (1932) reported 15 bifid spines among 217 Eskimo skeletons --1 cervical, 6 thoracic, and 9 lumbar. No other population study of spina

bifida seems to have included the lumbar and thoracic regions--probably because population differences in these two regions have been considered negligible.
The paucity of published data is not disappointing since, as noted in the "introduction," museum and laboratory collections of skeletons must be greatly biased as population samples for such an abnormal trait as manifest spina bifida. The present endeavor is focused on mild clefts and bifurcations.
In the two Cleveland samples, observations are limited to the last three thoracic and the five lumbar vertebrae. No case of spina bifida is recorded, and only six cases of marked cleavage--one white in L-5 and one Negro in each of the lumbar spines. In classifying mild clefts, a distinction is made between short grooves limited to the base of the spine and grooves extending from top to bottom of the spine. Results are presented in Tables 2 and 3.
Negroes exceed whites in all eight of these vertebra in the frequencies of clefts, particularly of major clefts extending "from top to bottom" of the dorsal surface of the spine. Sample sizes are too small, however, to justify firm statements regarding population differences (Table 3-A).

THE SACRUM
Although sacral spines vary far more widely in form and degree than those of the three superior regions of the vertebral column, mild clefts and bifurcations are most rare. They are not mentioned in published works, and only three cases were observed in the 1,158 sacra examined in the present study. All are in S-3.
A special form of spina bifida is involved in hiatus sacralis, the dorsal opening in the central nervous system canal which may involve only the fifth

sacral vertebra, less frequently the fourth and fifth, much less frequently the third through fifth, etc. Population data of several authors are reviewed in Table 4. Unfortunately, they are not satisfactorily comparable because of differences in classification systems, but it might seem that among Chinese, Europeans, Japanese, and Koreans the caudal end of the nerve canal is more apt to be open--i.e., the hiatus more apt to be longer--than in Stewart's sample (1932) of 147 Eskimos.

· Category "A" corresponds with the first category of Table 5, "Sacral canal completely closed"; categories B through F differ in minor details from the remaining categories of Table 5, so that precise comparisons may not be made.

with other authors' because of classification differences, but these are to be adjusted in the near future. Scanning Table 5, an association is evident between larger hiatus among population samples which have longer histories of civilization, and vice versa. This observation is consistent with Stewart's (1932) observation that Japanese and Europeans have a longer hiatus than his sample of Eskimo. The data in Tables 4 and 5 are to be assembled in a single table after making adjustment for differences in classification. At present, estimates of statistical significance of the differences between population samples have been made only for those in Table 5. Differences between Aleuts and the five other populations are significant along the second line ("closed down to union of S-4 and S-5") at the .001 level; differences between either Aleuts or North American Indians and each of the four "civilized" samples are significant along several of the lines at the 1% and 5% levels.
Spina bifida of S-l with hernia into the nerve canal is also more frequent among samples of populations with longer histories of civilization. This trait, independent of hiatus, is equally frequent among samples of Eskimo and Japanese (12%, Table 4) but is markedly

more frequent among American whites and ancient Egyptians (18% and 15%, respectively) than among the present samples of ancient Peruvians, Aleuts, and North American Indians (1% to 4%, last line of Table 5).
A complete and systematic study of spina bifida in the sacrum should include consideration of the size, shape, and general robusticity of the spines, since it appears that large, robust spines are less frequently associated with abnormal growth. Such a study would be laborious, since variation in size and shape of sacral spines is enormous compared with spines of other regions of the vertebral column. From examinations of 1,158 sacra in the 14 present population samples, the impression is clear of a dichotomy between populations with longer versus those with shorter histories of civilization, the latter having larger and stronger sacral spines (Tables 5 and 5-A).
In the present pilot study each of the five sacral spines is classified grossly in four categories:
1. Normal: not cleft, regardless of size or shape or symmetry.
2. Bifid, closed: left and right spines distinct, regardless of symmetry; no opening (hernia) into nerve canal.

3. Bifid, half open: opening into nerve canal below (caudal to) the space between the separated spines, but not including this space.
4. Bifid, open: hernia of entire vertebra.
The data are presented in Table 6. They indicate no clear difference between populations. Two observations appear noteworthy: (a) Western Reserve whites and Egyptians have higher numbers of complete openings into the nerve canal in the first sacral vertebra than other population samples; (b) Aleuts and Eskimos appear to have lower frequencies of spina bifida, particularly of cases involving openings, than other samples.
Neither of these observations is of statistical significance, but both might be brought out by larger sample size.
SUMMARY
Estimates of population frequencies of adult spina bifida should not be based

on skeletal collections in museums since they are too subject to sampling bias. Mild clefts and spina bifida occulta might be less prone to bias.
Mild clefts in each of five cervical spines (G-2 through C-6) are more frequent in the present American Negro sample than in the white sample, but bifurcations are more frequent in the white sample, which corroborates the results of two published studies. The reverse situation is found in the three lowest thoracic and the lumbar spines, the excess among Negroes contrasted with whites being greater for marked clefts than for milder clefts. In the sacrum, mild clefts are extremely rare. Population comparisons are made in three other respects: (a) length of the sacral hiatus, which usually involves S-5 alone, very frequently S-4 and S-5, and progressively more rarely S-3 through S-5; (b) hernia S-l, independently of hiatus; (c) overt

bifidity, either with or without opening into nerve canal. Spina bifida is clearly more frequent in populations with histories of civilization in the first two respects (aand b), inpreviously reported studies as well as in the present study, but less clearly so in the third respect (c).
Despite the obvious weaknesses of this pilot study--small sample sizes, arbitrary classes and subjective classification-- there is strong suggestion of real frequency differences in several manifestations of spina bifida between "civilized" and "non-civilized" populations in all four regions of thespinal column. Cervical and sacral spines manifest the greatest differences, with higher frequencies among the "civilized"; the lowest three thoracic and all five lumbar spines manifest less marked differences, with higher frequencies among the "uncivilized."
