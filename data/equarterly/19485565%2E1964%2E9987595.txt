INTRODUCTION 1
The Taiwan Provincial Maternal and
Child Health Institute (MCHI) has in
force a family planning program, known
officially as the Pre-Pregnancy Health
(PPH) Program, in more than 100of the
361 health stations throughout the is-
land. Assigned to these health stations,
usually one per station, are full-time workers (PPH workers)2 who are re-
cruited, trained, and supervised by the
MCHI staff to promote family planning
practice in the townships served by the
health stations. With the aim of improv-
ing the health and general welfare of the
mothers (and their children) by wayof
family-size adjustment, their specific task
is to introduce family planning ideas
and knowledge of contraceptive methods
to married couples, to promote actual

2As of July 1, 1962, there were 124 PPH workers assigned to 118 health stations. They ranged in age from 18 to 58, with half of them in the range of 20 to 38. The average agewas 30.6. Fifty-nine per cent were married and 60% were trained as nurses or midwives. All but three of the others had at least a junior high school education.

use among them, and to make supplies available to them at the latter's home, at the health stations, or at other places of convenience. Until recently each worker had been required every month to recruit at least 15 new cases for family planning guidance and to make followup visits on them after 15 days, 60 days, six months, and a year of initial acceptance.
The program was started on an experimental basis in April, 1960 in eight of the thirteen townships in Nantou Hsien in Central Taiwan and gradually extended to other selected places in different parts of the island. As of April 1, 1964, a cumulative total of 43,766 cases have been brought into theprogram. An individual record has been kept for each of these cases. The record includes the age, education, and occupation of the woman and her husband, the date (or dates) of marriage, the history of separation from the husband, the history of pregnancies, including outcome and dates and sex of live births, the methods of contraception accepted, regularity of use, complaints, failures, etc. The availability of these case records and the system of continuous registration that is enforced in Taiwan by which birth performance of each woman can be followed afford us an unusual opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of theprogram in terms of what happens to the

fertility of the cases once they accept family planning guidance.3
The present report summarizes our effort to evaluate the program on a limited scale--limited in the area covered and in the period observed. The cases include only those recruited at the eight health stations in Nantou Hsien because PPH activities have been in force there longest and only those recruited there through September 30, 1961, to assure us a sufficiently long period of observation since the cases' entry into the program. As of September 30, 1961, a cumulative total of 2,444 cases were recruited throughout the province, 1,361 of these--60%--at the eight health stations of Nantou Hsien where our analysis is focused. The period of observation varies according to what is compared. For a comparison of pregnancy rates the period is from entry into the program to last home visit as of June 30, 1962. More than half of the Nantou Hsien cases have been in the program for 10 months or more by last contact as of that date, the average being about 12 months. For a comparison of birth rates the period of observation is from entry into the program to December 31, 1963, by which time at least 27 months had elapsed since the last case under observation entered the program in September, 1961.*
THE CASES: A BRIEF PROFILE
A few salient facts pertaining to the cases and their husbands are presented as

4Actually followup in the population registers was made at three different times: as of June 30, 1962, June 30, 1963, and December 31, 1963. While only the results to the most recent followup are reported here, the interim results fully anticipated these.

background. Of the 1,361 cases, 40% have never attended school as compared with 13 per cent of their husbands. Fifty-one per cent of the cases and 60% of their husbands have attended primary school, while only 6% of the former and 15% of the latter have gone beyond that level. There is a slight underrepresentation of couples without schooling among the PPH cases as compared with the general population of the eight townships as the following figures show:5

A slight majority (57%) of the husbands are engaged in agriculture. Public servants constitute an unusually large group (12%), followed by owners of commercial establishments (10%), personal service people (8%), and owners of small manufacturing places (5%). The remaining 8% are in miscellaneous other occupations. Farmers seem underrepresented given the fact that agriculture predominates in these and other townships of Nantou Hsien (65% of the occupied male population in 1961 were in agriculture).
The PPH cases are concentrated in the ages between 25 and 45. Few are under 25 (5%) or over 45 (2%). Their age distribution compares as follows with
5The figures for the general population are for men and women 12 years old and over not in school as of 1961. The underrepresentation of those without schooling is no doubt greater than apparent in these superficial comparisons in that the cases and their husbands were considerably older than the general population for which the figures are available.

Among the cases, the better-schooled and those whose husbands are in nonfarm occupations tend to be younger than the less-schooled and those -whose husbands are farmers. The mean age of the cases with some schooling is 33.1 as against 36.4 for those without schooling. The mean age of the wives of nonfarm workers is 33.3 as against 35.4 for the wives of farmers. There is suggestion that the better-schooled and nonfarm couples tend to avail themselves of the PPH service at somewhat younger ages than the others.
Most of the cases had already had moderately large families when they accepted guidance under the program. Table 1 shows the distribution of the PPH cases by number and sex of their children at the time of their entry into the program. Eighty per cent had at least four children, 13% had three, only 5% had two, and 2%, just one. Not only that, but most of the cases (86 fo) had at least two sons. Within each parity, those with at least one son predominate, suggesting the importance of having a son or two before family planning guidance is accepted. There is selectivity of one kind or another at work here. Either the high-parity couples are more likely to avail themselves of the PPH service or the PPH workers are more likely to visit the high-parity couples before they visit the others. There prob-

ably is interaction between these two influences. In any case, a preference for a moderate-size family with at least two sons is strongly suggested. Seventy-four per cent of the 1,361 cases had at least four children and at least two sons when they entered the program. Available data show further that nonfarm couples and those with some schooling are likely to avail themselves of the program at somewhat lower parity and with fewer sons than farm couples and those without any schooling. This is generally the case regardless of the age of the wife.
Eighty-two per cent of the cases reported that they had never used contraception before their exposure to the PPH program. Only 10% reported having had any previous experience with contraception. In 8f0 of the cases the record is incomplete on this item.
The chief methods of contraception the PPH workers recommended to their

cases, until recently, had been the condom and foam tablets.6 Initial acceptances therefore were concentrated in these methods: 48%, condom and 33%, foam tablets. Interestingly, there were 18 cases that requested the Ota ring (a polyethylene Graefenberg-type intrauterine device) at initial contact. On last contact as of June 30, 1962, altogether 121 cases were wearing this device.
THE METHODS OF ANALYSIS
The major objective of the present analysis is to show what effect the PPH program has had upon the fertility of the cases that accepted family planning guidance involving for the most part conventional methods of contraception. Specifically, the effectiveness of the PPH program is evaluated for the 1,361 cases (or parts thereof depending on availability of data) that entered the program in Nantou Hsien between April 1960 and September 30, 1961. To make a conservative evaluation, giving the minimum effect of the program, all cases in the program even for a short time are included. Even those cases (1.5%) later discovered to be pregnant at the time they entered the program are included in some of the comparisons.
The main techniques used in the evaluation are:
1. To compare the pregnancy rates before and after the cases' entry into the program to last home visit as of June 30, 1962, or to June 30, 1962, for those cases in which home visits were made since that date to the time of data-collection in September of the same year. The pregnancy rate is defined as the number of pregnancies

occurring to the cases during the period of observation per 100 net years of exposure to risk of conception. The net period of exposure was determined by deducting from the aggregate years of marriage in the period of observation the following: periods of separation from the husband, nine months for a normal pregnancy, three months for a fetal loss (unless more definite figures were available), and a puerperal period of two months for each completed pregnancy. These data along with the number of pregnancies were available in the case records kept by the PPH workers.
2. To compare the birth rates before and after the cases' entry into the program to December 31, 1963. The birth rate is defined as the number of live births during the period of observation per 100 woman-years.7 Birth data from the case records examined up to last home visit as of June 30, 1962, are supplemented from the population registers of each township where PPH activities have been in force. Of the 1,361 original cases, 918 were followed through to December 31, 1963. The attrition of cases is due to the removal from observation of the following: (a) those cases discovered to have been pregnant at the time of their entry into the program or to have come from townships other than where the PPH service was available; (b) those cases that moved out or were divorced or widowed since entering the program as also those cases whose matches under technique 3 moved out or were divorced or widowed during the period of observation; and (c) those cases whose matches became PPH cases following their initial selection as matches.
7 In computing the birth rates for the period following entry into the program, nine months are subtracted for each case from the aggregate months of exposure to risk of live births since risk would be nil for these women during the first nine months as they were not pregnant at the time of their entry. Rates computed without this adjustment result in overestimating the reduction in fertility in the program.

3. To compare the birth rates of the cases before and after entering the program with a control group of "matches" selected in the registers so that for every case there is a matching couple in the same township who at the time the case entered the program had similar characteristics with respect to wife's age, duration of marriage, number of living children, and number of living sons but who never entered the program in the period of observation. It was further stipulated that the matching case not have a live birth within nine months of the corresponding PPH case's entry into the program. The latter restriction was necessary inasmuch as women were selected into the program because they were not then pregnant (although a few discovered later that they were pregnant at the time of their entry). Matching on this additional criterion served to equalize the period of risk involved in the computation of the birth rates to be compared between the PPH cases and their matches. In this way 918 cases were matched, and the birth performances of both the cases and their matches followed through in the population registers to December 31, 1963.8
4. To compare the actual birth rates of the cases from entry in the program to December 31, 1963, with what it would have been had they been subject to the marital age-specific birth rates of the general population in Nantou Hsien during this period.
EINDINGS
Our findings indicate that the PPH
program has had a definite effect in re-
ducing the fertility of those in the pro-
gram. This reduction is greater than
that occurring in the general population.
It is present in groups of every age, dura-
tion of marriage, parity, education, or
occupation. Substantiation is given for

this broad generalization in the following results:

1. The pregnancy rates for the cases in the last five years before entering the program 9 range from 50.9 in Luku to 62.0 in Tsaotun. The rates after entry into the program to June 30, 1962, become very low, ranging from 5.8 in Chichi to 21.8 in Chushan. The rate of decline for the eight townships combined is as high as 72.6%-- from 57.0 before to 15.6 after entry into the program. Chichi shows a de-

8 In order to facilitate the matching operation, a 60-month variation was allowed for both the wife's age and her length of marriage. The algebraic sum of the differences in age between the cases and their matches is ­.6 months; that for length of marriage is ­2.8 months. In other words, even with a relaxed criterion, the matching achieved is remarkably close. The cases and the matches have the following means with respect to these two characteristics:

PPH cases Matches

Mean age of wife Mean number of years married

35.2 14.9

35.5 15.1

Matchmgs achieved for husband's occupation and wife's education also are very close, although these were not used as criteria for matching. The distributions compare as follows:

Birth rates for the matches also are computed with the adjustment in the aggregate months of exposure to risk of live births as in the case for the PPH cases.
9 The fertility in the last five years rather than in the entire period of marriage before entry into the program is used as the base from which to measure the subsequent decline in order not to overestimate that decline. As might be expected, the pregnancy rate for the entire period of marriage before the program (63.5) is considerably higher than that for the last five years before the program (57.0).

cline of as much as 89.6%! The data are summarized in Table 2.
This kind of decline is evident regardless of education and occupation. As Table 3 shows, the decline in the pregnancy rate is 70% or more in every category of education and occupation by which the cases are grouped. Interestingly, the rates of decline are higher for the less-schooled and the farmers than for the better-schooled and the nonfarmers. As a matter of fact, the pregnancy rates before and after entry into the program are lower for the former than for the latter. While a more detailed analysis is required for a full understanding of these patterns, they probably are at least in part accountable in terms of the age and parity at which these cases tend to enter the program. We noted earlier that the less-schooled and the farmers' wives tend to avail themselves of the program at somewhat later ages and at higher parity. Their subsequent fertility can be expected to be lower simply from their greater advance in age. But the influence of parity seems even

more important, as we shall presently see.
2. The birth rates for the cases in the last five years before entering the program range from 35.9 in Chichi to 38.4 in Nantou, the overall rate for the eight townships being 37.6. These are reduced after entry into the program to 10.1 in Chichi and 18.7 in Chungliao, or 13.5 for the entire group by December 31, 1963. The rates of decline are substantial, just as for the pregnancy rates. They range from 50.3% in Chungliao to as high as 71.9% in Chichi, the rate of decline for the entire group being 64.1%. Table 4 summarizes these findings.
As with the pregnancy rates, the decline in the birth rates is evident among the less-schooled and the farmers as well as among the better-schooled and the nonfarmers. In fact, as Table 5 shows, the decline is greater for the former than for the latter. Moreover, there is strong indication in unpublished data that the lower birth rates subsequent to entry into the program of the less-schooled and the farmers as compared to the better-

schooled and the nonfarm couples is related to their higher parity and larger number of sons at entry. This is indicated in nearly every age group. What is suggested is that the program is more effective for those who are under greater pressure to begin with in terms of the number of children they already have. This is consistent with other findings of this study.

3. While the decline in the pregnancy rates and the birth rates of the cases after entry into the program is impressive, this evidence alone is not sufficient to prove the success of the program. Decline in fertility with advance in age and with repeated childbearing is inevitable, independent of efforts to control it. Furthermore, voluntary control may be a general phenomenon independent of the PPH program affecting the fertility of those not in the program as well as those in the program. Effectiveness of the program is demonstrated only when the reduction in fertility among the cases is substantially greater than that among the general population. This is demonstrated in our findings.
The birth rates (per 100 woman-years)
before and after entry into the program
of the 918 cases and their matches not
in the program are as follows:

While the birth rate for the PPH cases was higher than their matches by 13% in the period before the former's entry into the program, it was lower by 21% after entry. Decline is general, as might be expected. But the significant point is that the decline is considerably greater for the PPH cases (64%) than for their matches (48%). Table 6 shows that this contrast between the PPH cases and their matches is replicated in every township but one (Chichi). A most interesting phenomenon once again is that the PPH cases invariably had higher fertility than their matches just before entry into the program but emerge with lower fertility than their matches afterwards in all but one township (Chichi). Apparently those with especially high fertility in the most recent five-year period are selected into

the program, and they achieve effective reduction of their fertility once in the program.
The comparison of the birth rates for the PPH cases and their matches taking age into account sheds some interesting light on this last phenomenon (see Table 7). Before the program, the older the age group, the greater is the amount by which the birth rate of the PPH cases exceeds that of the matches. This suggests that with advancing age those with especially high fertility in the preceding five years are increasingly selected into the program. But the program is increasingly more effective the older the age group considered. After entry into

the program, the older the age group, the greater is the amount by which the PPH cases have lower (rather than higher) birth rates than the matches.
Generally similar patterns are revealed when duration of marriage is taken into account in comparing the birth rates for the PPH cases and their matches. As with age, just before the program, the longer they have been married, the greater is the amount by which the birth rate of the PPH cases exceeds that of the matches. After entry into the program, the pattern is reversed (see Table 8).
By partity, too, generally speaking, the PPH cases have increasingly higher birth

rates than the matches just before the program but increasingly lower birth rates afterwards (see Table 9). The change in the relative fertility of the PPH cases and their matches are also affected somewhat by the number of sons they have at the time of the cases' entry into the program. Though not always consistently, there is a suggestion that the larger the number of sons, the greater is the reduction in the birth rates for the PPH cases as compared with the matches.

Having an adequate number of sons apparently is a factor influencing not only entry into the program but also effective use of family planning once in the program.
All three of these sets of data indicate that those with the most pressure on them enter the program selectively, and it is most effective for them. Available data by occupation of the husband, education of the wife, and education of the husband show similar results. With but

4. Another way of evaluating the effectiveness of the PPH program is to compare the birth rate of the cases after entering the program with that which they would have had if during a specified period they were subject to the marital age-specific fertility rates prevailing in Nantou Hsien as a whole. This is shown below for the period from entry to December 31, 1963.10

Hypothetical birth rate of the PPH cases if subject to the 1961, 1962, and 1963 Nantou Hsien marital age-specific rates from entry into the program to December 31, 1963

Clearly, the actual birth rate of the PPH cases is very much lower than the general rate for women in their age groups. The fact, however, that the birth rate of the matched cases also is lower than that of the general population suggests that both the PPH cases
10 Marital age-specific fertility rates of 1961, 1962, and 1963 for the general population in Nantou Hsien were applied to the number of months the PPH cases were in the program during these years minus the first nine months for each case. The cases were allocated to the fiveyear age groups according to their ages as of Dec. 31, 1961. In applying the age-specific rates of Nantou Hsien, we have unrealistically assumed that the subjects remain fixed in age during the period of observation. Strictly speaking, it would be necessary to allocate the subjects to different age groups as they move from one group to the next during the course of observation. This would be necessary especially as the period of observation is extended. For a short period of observation, the difference that results from these procedures--one approximate and the other exact--is small. In the present situation the approximate procedure used probably overestimates the hypothetical birth rate somewhat and introduces a slight exaggeration in the effective reduction in fertility attributed to the program.

and their matches were selected by parity and number of sons and duration of marriage in categories favorable to subsequent lower fertility. Our interpretation is that their high parity and large number of sons lead to action of various kinds--either in or out of the PPH program--to restrict further family growth. However, the effective action taken by those in the program is substantially greater than for those not in the program. The birth rate for the matches is 15% below what might have been expected on the basis of their age distribution alone. But the birth rate for the PPH cases is 33% below what might have been expected on this basis--that is, there is a reduction of 18% in addition to the general effect of parity, number of sons, and duration of marriage.
These findings from the present study are consistent with findings from several other studies completed by the Taiwan Population Studies Center.11 There is evidence of fertility decline throughout Taiwan in the official registration statistics. So far, however, this decline has shown up in most places only among women 30 years of age and over, suggesting that fertility control is being taken up not immediately upon marriage but after about 10 years of marriage when many women in Taiwan already have a moderate-size family of about three or four children and a son or two. Interview surveys covering married subjects in Taichung City support this. There is ovenvhelming approval of family planning, and persons of high parity and with sons in particular have begun to do something about it independently of an organized program to promote family planning among them.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION
The case records of the 1,361 women in Nantou Hsien who accepted family planning guidance between April 1960 and September 30, 1961, under the PrePregnancy Health Program of the Taiwan Provincial Maternal and Child Health Institute and the population registers of 918 of these and their "matches" were examined with the aim of evaluating the effectiveness of the program in bringing about fertility reduction.
Both the pregnancy rate and the birth rate of the PPH cases showed substantial reduction once they entered the program. However, the reduction in birth rate was considerably greater for the PPH cases than for a "control" group of matched cases. The program seemed to select into it women of especially high fertility-- increasingly so with advance in age, duration of marriage, and parity--and to be increasingly more effective for them. Finally, the actual fertility of the PPH cases since their entry into the program was found to be significantly lower than the level expected of them had they been subject during this period to the marital age-specific rates of the general population in Nantou Hsien.
Our findings indicate that the PPH program has been effective in bringing about definite reduction in fertility among those who are directly exposed to it. This conclusion is based on a conservative evaluation in that we have included as cases all those who initially accepted guidance without regard to their subsequent disposition. It is noteworthy that the PPH program has achieved the kind of effect reported here with the conventional methods of contraception. With the introduction of the improved intrauterine device (the Lippes loop), not only have many more new cases come into the program but also

many old cases have switched to this more effective method. The effectiveness of the program should be increased considerably by this new development. In any case, as a next step in research, it would be useful to see how, since the launching of the program, the birth rates differ between the townships served by PPH workers and those not served. This kind of comparison, which is now under way, will serve to show the total impact of the program--both direct and indirect --on fertility reduction among the people of Taiwan.

This study was undertaken through the facilities of the Taiwan Population Studies Center. The Center, located in Taichung, Taiwan, is sponsored by the Taiwan Provincial Health Department under a grant from the Population Council of New York. It is engaged in basic demographic research on the population of this island province of the Republic of China and in scientific evaluation of the on-going prepregnancy health work there. Research activities for the period 1962-64 have been carried out in active cooperation with the University of Michigan Population Studies Center. The authors are indebted to Dr. T. C. Hsu, Provincial Commissioner of Health, and Dr. C. L. Chen, Director of the Provincial Maternal and Child Health Institute, for their support of our various projects. Dr. S. C. Hsu, Chief of the Rural Health Division of the SinoAmerican Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, has been an invaluable source of encouragement in our carrying out this particular evaluation study of a program he has been instrumental in getting started and expanding to its present scope.
