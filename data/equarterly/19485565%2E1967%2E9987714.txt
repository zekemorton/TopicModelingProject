UNWANTED CONCEPTIONS: RESEARCH ON UNDESIRABLE CONSEQUENCES *

EDWARD POHLMAN University of the Pacific

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:29 08 December 2015

The present article reviews literature bearing on the general hypothesis that unwanted conceptions have undesirable results, for parents and children. Relying primarily on case study evidence, a number of authors have suggested or assumed that this hypothesis was correct (e.g., Chesser, n. d.; Coghill, 1941; Menninger, 1942, pp. 219-233; 1943a; Soddy, 1964; Vander Veer, n. d.). The present writer (Pohlman, 1965a) has elaborated this general hypothesis into a number of much more specific hypotheses. Psychoanalytic theory underlies the hypotheses; in particular, it seems possible for parents to repress their feelings of rejection toward an unwanted conception, so that they consciously want it, but for repressed feelings still to affect parental behavior (Freud, 1916-1917). Hence observable differences in parents and children are predicted.
DEFINITIONS OF "UNWANTED" AND
"WANTED"
Elsewhere (Pohlman, 1965b) the present writer has struggled with the complex problems surrounding the definitions of "wanted," and "unwanted," and related terms. It is impossible to adopt any one set of precise definitions in the present review, precisely because the many different studies being reviewed have used widely differing operational definitions of these words. It is clear that we should think, not in terms of

dichotomies such as "wanted" and "unwanted," but of a continuum of feelings ranging from total rejection to very nearly total acceptance. However, for practical reasons it often becomes necessary to cut this continuum arbitrarily into categories.
A thoughtful critic of the present article has suggested several different "paths which rejection may follow," and these may help give perspective to the way in which terms are used, as well as to the assumptions underlying research. We have modified and adapted his scheme below. Conscious rejection may (1) continue and remain conscious; (2) continue but become repressed and unconscious; (3) decrease in intensity as positive aspects become more apparent--with resulting ambivalence; (4) become submerged by positive feelings, even at the unconscious level; (5) be only a superficial facade, perhaps in order to conform to social ideas. In this last instance the pregnancy fills needs and is not rejected; here it is the acceptance of pregnancy that is repressed and concealed beneath a conscious facade of rejection. Rejection of pregnancy is discussed more comprehensively in a forthcoming book (Pohlman, 1967).
FREQUENCIES OF UNWANTED
CONCEPTIONS
The importance of the material reviewed in this paper would seem to be somewhat proportional to the frequency of unwanted conceptions. Whelpton, Campbell, and Patterson (1966, Ch. 6)

classified 17% of all white couples in their large national probability sample as having "excess fertility"--the wife admitted that the couple's most recent conception was unwanted by one or both parents. In about half of such cases in this sample, one spouse wanted the child and the other did not. Among couples married 10 years or more, 23% had "excess fertility." Among nonwhites, 31% of all couples and 48% living on Southern farms had "excess fertility" (Whelpton et al., 1966, Ch. 9). Unwanted conceptions were more frequent among older couples, couples with more total children to date, and those of lower educational, occupational or financial status. Whatever the effects of newer contraceptives and recent campaigns to promote birth planning, unwanted conceptions account for a significant proportion of the United States population.
PSYCHOSOMATIC EFFECTS ON PREGNANT
WOMEN
This section discusses problems experienced by pregnant women and sometimes thought to be subject to psychosomatic influences. Concerning each such problem, the hypothesis is that pregnant mothers' conscious or unconscious anger and upset during pregnancy make them more liable to the psychosomatic disturbance than mothers following conceptions that are not unwanted.
Vomiting and Nausea
There seems to be agreement that "morning sickness" can be produced by psychological factors (Kroger and DeLee, 1946; Kroger and Freed, 1951; Taylor, 1962; Wengraf, 1953). The double-blind study of Geiger, Fahrenbach, and Healey (1959) suggests that

this malaise can be pharmaceutically controlled, somewhat independently of psychological factors. There is a common psychoanalytic hypothesis that morning sickness is often produced by unwanted pregnancies (Deutsch, 1945; Kroger and Freed, 1951, pp. 51, 52; W. Menninger, 1943b; Wengraf, 1953, pp. 11, 174-177). No such relation was found by Poffenberger, Poffenberger, and Landis (1952); Harvey and Sherfey (1954); Coppen (1959); or Robertson (1946). Despres (1936) did find such a relationship, but other factors may not have been adequately controlled. Fitzgerald and Webster (1938), studying nearly 400 cases of hyperemesis gravidarum (extreme vomiting) in compariison to controls, found unmarried mothers with no greater incidence of the problem than married ones. Clifford (1962) found unmarried women to have significantly less nausea than either married primiparae or married multiparae. Presumably, unmarried mothers would be more likely to reject the conception. Newton (1963, p. 655) summarizes other studies suggesting that unmarried mothers may tend to have a smaller incidence of pregnancy vomiting; and one study of 85 women seeking induced abortion found not a single one reporting vomiting. It would appear that other psychosomatic factors, beyond the scope of this review, provide better explanations for "morning sickness" than rejection of conception. Ambivalence may be more significant than outright rejection. Chertok, Mondzain, and Bonnaud (1963), studying French women, found vomiting among 47% of those expressing undiluted resentment of pregnancy, 60% of those expressing only joy, but 82% of those expressing both reactions.
Clearly, some women who reject pregnancy do not have morning sickness.

Research does not exclude the possible contention that all of those with morning sickness unconsciously reject their pregnancies, but it hardly provides support for that contention. Erikson (1948) believes that vomiting has the symbolic meaning of rejection and expulsion; but that if a culture makes a custom of vomiting during pregnancy, it loses its diagnositic value. Kroger and DeLee (1946) found that some women eagerly desired pregnancy and looked forward to nausea and vomiting to prove pregnancy.
Spontaneous Abortion
In the white nonprison sample of Gebhard et al. (1958, p. 29), 18% of 3,575 conceptions to married women ended in spontaneous abortion. Mann and Grimm (1962, p. 157) estimated that there were some 50,000 spontaneous abortions annually in the United States. The latter authors review other studies and their own research as suggesting that psychotherapy can reduce the tendency to spontaneous abortion; hence psychological factors may, in some cases, lead to spontaneous abortions. Weil and Stewart (1957) and Tupper (1962, p. 147) express a similar view. Wengraf (1953, pp. 245-247) cites a number of dramatic case studies, and concludes that emotional factors can terminate a pregnancy at any point. Devereux (1955) summarizes anthropological material which suggests that faith in an abortion-producing practice may produce abortion.
Wengraf (1953, p. 247) advances a psychoanalytic rationale to explain how rejection of pregnancy can lead to spontaneous abortion. Sudden shocks (such as falling down stairs or witnessing an accident) merely provide the organism with an "excuse" to satisfy the uncon-

scious desires of the mother and expel the fetus. Dunbar (1962, pp. 136, 137) distinguishes between those who are deeply, basically rejecting of a pregnancy and those for whom it is merely a temporary inconvenience. She suggests that the former readily produce a psychosomatic abortion while the latter are rarely effective to such an end. In the light of Dunbar's discussion (1962) one must conclude, apparently, that the considerable numbers of women in our culture who have out-of-wedlock births, and who do not have spontaneous abortions, are not deeply rejecting toward the pregnancy. Whatever the merits of these expert opinions, we have found no systematic research that demonstrates a relationship between unwanted conception and spontaneous abortion, although such a possibility seems plausible.
Toxemias of Pregnancy and Problemsof Labor and Delivery
Salerno (1962) reviews his own data and those of other studies to suggest that eclampsia and pre-eclampsia may be psychosomatically produced. It appears that out-of-wedlock conceptions are implicated, but this point loses most of its force since this is true primarily among very young mothers. Coppen (1958) matched 50 pre-eclamptic and 50 control clinic cases on age, number of children, and time of examination during pregnancy. The pre-eclamptic group showed significantly more unwanting feelings toward the anticipated child. Severe and continued rejection was quite common in this group, and uncommon among controls. But significant relationships with other factors were also observed. We have little data to help evaluate the hypothesis that toxemias of pregnancy may be linked to unwanted conceptions.
Newton (1963) reviews some evidence

suggesting that psychological factors may affect the success of labor and delivery, although there are also some studies with negative findings on this point. The positive findings provide a rationale for expecting that emotions associated with unwanted conception might produce childbirth problems. Jones (1942) opines that if the woman has unconscious hatred, guilt, or fear involving the fetus, these may inhibit the expulsive movements or exaggerate them in a violent, uncoordinated, and ill-timed pattern. Negative findings are reported by Zemlick and Watson (1953) and Klein, Potter, and Dyk (1950). Davids and DeVault (1960) presented pregnant women with a TAT picture. Of those who later had normal deliveries, 60% saw a pregnant woman, compared with 21% of those who later had abnormalities in delivery. Failure to perceive the woman as pregnant might be interpreted as a projected rejection of pregnancy.
There is some evidence of a link between labor and delivery problems and rejection of the feminine role (Chertok et al., 1962; Davids and DeVault, 1960). One may theorize that pregnant women who reject femininity are also rejecting of the pregnancy; but they may be somewhat distinctive from other women who reject a given conception but not femininity in general. In short, there is little direct evidence of a link between unwanted conception and labor and delivery problems.
Section Summary
It seems plausible to believe that unwanted conception might produce psychosomatic problems for the pregnant woman. But direct evidence of such a relationship is almost completely lacking.

OTHER EFFECTS ON PARENTS
Induced Abortion
In the white nonprison samples of Gebhard et al. (1958, pp. 29, 57), a sixth of the known pregnancies of married women, and 89% for those who remained single throughout pregnancy, ended in induced abortion. In other words, nine out of ten premarital pregnancies which were not "saved by the bell" of marriage ended in induced abortion. A critic of the present manuscript indicates his doubt that this high proportion has any general validity for any large population group. The sample of Gebhard et al. (1958) (the same women studied in the elaborated "Kinsey report") was not a random sample of any particular population, cannot be assumed to be representative of the United States population in general, and was probably biased toward individuals who were somewhat more liberal than average in their sexual conduct and in their willingness to undergo induced abortion. How serious this bias is we can only conjecture. Commenting on this 89% figure, Gebhard and his colleagues (1958, p. 57) state:
The social stigma attached to illegitimacy in this country is such that the vast majority of unmarried pregnant women will desperately seek and secure abortions.
In a sample of married women in Great Britain, Lewis-Faning (1949, pp. 172, 173) compared 933 completed pregnancy periods where birth control was reportedly used and then stopped (presumably wanted conceptions) with 992 where birth control reportedy failed (presumably unwanted conceptions). Admitted abortions of all kinds (induced and spontaneous) ended 9.5% of the former and 18% of the latter pregnancy periods. Induced abortion was admitted

concerning 0.4% of the former (wanted) pregnancy periods and 4% of the latter (unwanted) ones. Through careful calculations Lewis-Faning estimated that admissions were conservative in the latter group, and that the figures were really more like 0.4 and 8.7%, respectively. It seems clear that almost all of those who had induced abortions did not want the conceptions involved.1
The negative consequences of induced abortion in our culture, in terms of guilt and its concomitants, are widely recognized. Illegal abortion is often medically dangerous, although Tietze and Lehfeldt (1961, p. 1154) find that risk to life from abortion carried out in a hospital by an experienced physician upon a healthy woman in her first trimester of pregnancy is "far smaller" than the ordinary risks of pregnancy and birth. It appears that induced abortion provides one clear argument for the importance of attempting to avoid unwanted conception.

believed to be involved in many cases (Boesky et al., 1960; Kroger and Freed, 1951, Ch. 5; W. Menninger, 1943b; Smalldon, 1940). Zilboorg (1957) contends that there is little relation between the wanted-unwanted status of conception and parapartum psychoses. Boesky et al. (1960, pp. 1213, 1214) assert that in his "later years" Zilboorg placed great stress on "severe unconscious hostility."
In more formal research designs, Gordon and Gordon (1957) and Gordon (1957) provide evidence that psychiatric maternity patients have more unplanned pregnancies than controls. Also, of a group of 98 normal patients, those with "some" emotional upset, as rated by their attending physicians, showed some significant differences which might be interpreted as associated with unwanted conception, in answering a questionnaire (Gordon and Gordon, 1959). Tetlow (1955) shows that illicit pregnancy may be related to para partum upset; presumably conception is unwanted in most illicit pregnancies.

Emotional Illness Surrounding Birth
Boesky, Cross, and Morley (1960) cite evidence that as recently as 1900 most text books assumed that mental illnesses of pregnancy were basically different from other mental illnesses. Current views regard para partum psychoses as dynamically similar to emotional upheavals at any time, and as usually falling about equally into the two categories of schizophrenias and depressions (see also Kroger and Freed, 1951, Ch. 5). Emotional disturbance surrounding childbirth is the product of multiple factors and shows a relationship to prior emotional history (Jacobs, 1943; Victoroff, 1952). Conscious or unconscious rejection of an unwanted conception is

"Normal" Emotional Upset
Of 212 wives, those who reported having deliberately tried to avoid conception recalled significantly more emotional upset during the first trimester of pregnancy (Poffenberger et al., 1952). Similar differences were not present for later trimesters nor the period since childbirth. Klein et al. (1950) found no evidence that unwanted pregnancies were followed by more maternal anxiety during pregnancy or childbirth.
Divorce and Marital Friction
Christensen and Meissner (1953) compared 178 couples where conception was definitely premarital and 989 where it was definitely postmarital. The former group had a higher divorce rate. In

view of the controls and comparisons used, the authors conclude that a large part of the difference could be accounted for by the premarital conception itself. In some cases, probably, a marriage was forced that might not otherwise have occurred; in others, a couple planning to wed anyway might have found premarital conception a difficult way to start married life. One may speculate that other couples who did not divorce found premarital conception a source a marital problems.
Among conceptions presumably within wedlock, Burgess and Cottrell (1939) found the poorest marital adjustment ratings among those with one or more unwanted children. Reed (1947) found unwanted pregnancies correlated with lower marriage adjustment, for the sample in general and for sub-groups, including a comparison limited to couples with exactly two children apiece. In these studies one cannot be sure that unwanted conceptions produced lower marital happiness, since the reverse might be true and still other explanations are possible. But some individual cases undoubtedly fall into this pattern.
Infanticide and child abuse have costs to parents, in terms of guilt and its correlates, and may be chargeable in part to unwanted conception. They will be discussed in the next section.
EFFECTS ON CHILDREN
The Fetus
Abortion obviously ends a potential life. Some mothers attempt abortion but are unsuccessful (Hall and Mohr, 1933; Thompson, 1942). Wengraf (1953, pp. 241, 242) opines that "any anomaly" may result. In addition to direct physiological problems, the mothers' guilt and conflict surrounding the attempt may

affect her later interaction with the child (Caplan, 1954).
It appears that strong emotions in the pregnant mother may affect the developing fetus. This has been suggested by animal studies (Doyle and Yule, 1959; Thompson, 1957; Thompson and Sontag, 1956; Thompson, Watson, and Charlesworth, 1962). Sontag(1941; 1944; 1962) presents evidence, from small numbers of cases, that the human fetus may be affected if the mother experiences heightened emotion. Sontag suggests that an infant born to an upset, unhappy mother may tend from birth on to have a high activity level, being an irritable, squirming, hyperactive, crying child--"to all intents and purposes a neurotic infant when he is born" (Sontag, 1944, p. 4).
Stott (1957; 1958; 1959; 1961), Turner (1956), and Strean (1958) provide some additional evidence, mostly retrospective, that strong stress during pregnancy may affect the fetus. Ferreira (1960) studied 163 women during the last month of pregnancy, using a questionnaire that measured fear of harming the baby and rejection of pregnancy. Independent ratings were obtained from nurses during the first five days of postnatal life. Mothers of 23 infants classed as "deviant" had expressed greater fear of harming the babies and tended to fall either very high or very low on the "rejection of pregnancy" scale. Fear of harming babies and excessively low "rejection" scores might both be interpreted as over-reaction to hostile impulses, as Ferreira notes, although this psychoanalytic explanation is not the most parsimonious one possible. Wallin and Riley (1950) used such psychosomatic problems of pregnancy as nausea and vomiting as an index of negative reaction toward pregnancy. They found some evidence, based on mothers' re-

ports, that such problems were related to certain measured problems of infants. This study, unlike that of Ferreira (1960), does not provide a basis for distinguishing prenatal and postnatal factors. Other relevant research is reviewed by Montagu (1962, Ch. 8). It appears plausible that severe maternal feelings of hostility, rage, and guilt surrounding the results of an unwanted conception may affect the fetus, a point claimed by Sänger (1926).
The Infant
Newton and Newton (1962) did not find a significant relation between mothers' reported feelings about pregnancy and their reactions upon seeing the baby for the first time. Zemlick and Watson (1953) found that mothers who seemed to show the greatest dislike of pregnancy were especially solicitous and indulgent in their relations to the infant. They interpreted this as over-reaction to rejection. Escalona (1945) suggests that the infant will respond to the "true" feelings of the mother, despite attempts to cover up any conscious or unconscious rejection under a facade of consideration and concern. Ribble (1943) claimed that adequate mothering could not be provided by women who rejected their children.
The feeding situation has been a focus of attention, to see whether nonideal maternal attitudes might produce gastrointestinal upset. Lakin (1957a; 1957b) compared 20 mothers of colicky infants with 20 controls. Using a modified TAT, independently scored, he found mothers of colicky infants with significantly less desirable ratings on all five variables studied. The less systematic observations of Ribble (1943), Escalona (1945), and Freud (1946) appear to be in agreement. Pinneau and Hopper (1958) systemati-

cally studied maternal emotional factors in relation to régurgitation and burping among infants. Findings were not in line with interpretations mentioned above. Indeed where statistically significant differences obtained, they involved more burping and régurgitation among infants of "less anxious and/or better adjusted mothers." Whether unwanted conceptions tend to affect the feeding situation and hence the infant is conjectural. Hypotheses that mothers who reject their conceptions are less likely to breast-feed, or to use other presumably desirable feeding approaches, and that these techniques in turn affect infants, are so circuitous and undemonstrated as not to warrant detailed attention.
Yarrow (1961) concludes that the extensive literature leads "with an impressive consistency" to the general conclusion that deviant circumstances in early maternal care tend to correlate with subsequent problems in personal-social and intellectual functioning for the children. To the extent that illegitimate babies are the product of unwanted conception and tend to find their way in vtndue proportions into institutions, it would appear that failure to avoid their conception may result in problems for them. We noted earlier that marriages forced by conception tend to have higher divorce proneness (Christensen &Meissner, 1953), and speculated that they also contain more marital friction. If so, there are implications for children. Several studies find little difference in effects on children between divorced and unhappy stay-together homes (Burchinal, 1964; Landis, 1962; Nye, 1957), but Landis (1962) noted that both kinds are inferior to more happy unbroken homes. Jenkins (1958) compared lower-class Negro children of legitimate and illegitimate birth status in their personal and school adjustment; in general, differences favored

the former. Several other variables were held constant.
Sears, Maccoby, and Levin (1957, pp. 56, 515) found mothers who recalled having felt more pleased with the pregnancy showing greater warmth in infancy (r of .23). Other correlations (pp. 56, 57, 514) imply greater warmth (1) when the child had a greater age gap from the next-oldest child, and (2) when boys followed previous all-girl families rather than previous all-boy families. Spacing and sex of births are not subject to alteration in mothers' retrospective reports; one may guess that the correlation between acceptance of pregnancy and maternal warmth was not completely the artifact of the retrospective research design. This correlation was found even though most mothers with strong negative feelings toward the pregnancy claimed to have changed their minds, consciously, by approximately the time of the child's birth (pp. 50-56).
Infanticide and Physical Abuse Some parents severely abuse their children, sometimes bringing them to hospitals for the care of resulting injuries. In the last decade medical personnel have recognized more of these cases (once assumed to be accidents, as parents claimed); they believe that a great many such cases exist (Fontana, 1964; Kempe et al., 1962). It may seem obvious that parents who kill their children, or abuse them severely, do not want them and probably did not want their conception to begin with. But in this area, as with induced abortion, there is little research that has checked on the "obvious" by asking the parents whether conception was wanted.
Older Children
Sears et al. (1957, pp. 56; 515) also found a significant relation (r of .13)

between mothers' descriptions of how they had felt when they found they were pregnant, and ratings of warmth toward children at kindergarten age. There is a substantial body of evidence, not cited here, suggesting that parental acceptance or rejection is important in affecting child development, perhaps more important than specific child-rearing practices. But the extent to which a parent's preconception wanting or unwanting feelings are related to acceptance of rejection in the child's later life is largely conjectural. It is possible that many parents are able to "change their minds" after an unwanted conception, with changes even in the unconscious and in their behavior, so that they treat the initially unwanted child in a way similar to the treatment received by otherwise comparable children.
For 103 of the delinquents studied by Kvaraceus (1945a; 1945b, pp. 59-70), one parent (usually the mother) replied to a question about whether the child had been planned or accidental; 84% were "accidental." Although the author recognizes the problems of sampling and lack of controls, he opines that this is probably a higher proportion than would have obtained among comparable nondelinquent groups. From other data he argues that a preponderance of these were probably unwanted, aggravating an already crowded home situation and hence being rejected.
Sloman (1948) started with a group of problem children and found an impressive proportion of them to have been specifically planned. Some of these had been planned in an attempt to hold a faltering marriage together. Most were seen as involving children of very compulsive mothers who planned out much of life, including conception. Sloman suggests that compulsive mothers are not

ideal from the viewpoint of the child's mental health.
SUMMARY AND INTERPRETATIONS
Summary
There is a contention that unwanted conceptions tend to have undesirable effects. This article has implied some channels whereby such a causal relationship might operate. But the direct evidence of such a relationship is almost completely lacking, except for a few fragments of retrospective evidence. This is primarily because there is little decisive research, rather than because of negative findings. At a common-sense level one may feel fairly confident that induced abortions, out-of-wedlock conceptions, and illegitimate births are the results of unwanted conception and produce undesirable effects. But these commonsense observations are available from the armchair. It was the hope of this article to find more convincing systematic research evidence and to give some idea of the amount of relationship between unwanted conception and undesirable effects. This hope has been disappointed.
Inaccessibility of the Independent Variable
One reason there is so little crucial evidence to bear on the hypothesis, and additional evidence will be hard to obtain, is the vagueness and remoteness of the independent variable of unwanted conception. It is extremely difficult for even the researcher to define this concept (Pohlman, 1965b), and often hard for the parent to weight his or her ambivalence and know whether a conception was or was not wanted. The very privacy of these parental judgments is hard for the researcher to conquer. Also, virtually all research that studied this indepen-

dent variable has involved parents' retrospective reports. The usual problems of cloudy memory are complicated because we may assume a strong tendency for parents to rationalize after unwanted conception, so that control groups of parents who claim "wanted" conception doubtless contain an unknown proportion misclassified. Because of these problems, research with other independent variables may be much more rewarding. Size of family, spacing and timing of births, out-of-wedlock conception, and illegitimate status of birth are much easier to define and much more open to public inspection.
Importance of Continued Research
This reviewer originally thought that if the undesirability of unwanted conceptions could be demonstrated with research, this would provide a powerful additional argument for the importance of birth planning. He now feels that such evidence is not so important. Alarm over population pressures provides a major impetus to public action concerning birth planning. Also, many individuals perceive unwanted conceptions as having undesirable effects; correct or not, these perceptions probably influence their actions as effectively as views based on additional research. These perceptions may be all to the good in today's world, for they may serve toward reducing population growth. Thus this writer concludes that the relationship between unwanted conception and undesirable effects is not a question demanding high priority in our research, if the allocation of priorities is in terms of pragmatic gains to be expected from the research. Of course the question does have academic interest. Psychologists interested in studying birth control might well look to facets of the topic other than

152

the hypothesized effects of unwantedconceptions. The present writer is now engaged in bringing together the effects of various patterns of timing births, invotving age of mother, duration of marriage, and interval to other births. References on this topic will be welcome.
An editorial critic of the present manuscript has indicated strong disagreement with the preceding paragraph:
It may be true, as the writer states, that many people already perceive unwanted conceptions as having undesirable effects. Strong factual evidence on this, however, would do much more than mere "belief" to convince administrators in charge of budgeting for family planning programs.
In early 1966the present writer attended a conference at which the Population Crisis Committee (1966) was trying to persuade certain groups within the National Institutes of Health to give greater priority to family planning in theirmental health programs. The writer and others found it somewhat embarrassing to have to confess that there was little clear evidence that unwanted conceptions were in a worse light than other conceptions. Perhaps the above-quoted critic is right in feeling that such evidence would have crucial importance in the minds of administrators. The extent to which administrators are sensitive to research evidence probably varies tremendously from administrator to administrator. In any case the present writer would maintain his conviction that research on the undesirability of unwanted conceptions should not be given high priority in research strategies. In addition to the importance of getting answers to the question, one must consider the sheer difficulty of getting such answers, for reasons spelled out above. Major advances in the study of the effects of unwanted conceptions must come through

longitudinal research, and this might be
done best in the context of major on-
going longitudinal studies of family and
child development.
