JLHE QUESTION of lowered fertility in interfaith marriages has interested social observers for some time. Analysis of the accumulated data for the study project, "The Human Biology of Academic Potential," reveals that ethnic origins figure prominently in the problem of lowered fertility of mixed or interfaith marriages. The purpose of this report is to explore the background of ethnic origins in these marriages.
Throughout the report, fertility will signify the number of live offspring.
Following Montagu, the term ethnic group will replace the much maligned and much abused "race" (Montagu, 1960). The interpretation of ethnic group is intentionally loose in definition at this beginning of the report. Various levels of ethnic groups will be recognized. Thus it will be accepted that one ethnic group may be divided into two or more ethnic groups. Sometimes an ethnic grouping will refer to individuals of the same religion, sometimes

to a grouping of individuals of a similar national origin, and sometimes to groups of individuals of the same religious preference and the same national origin. At all times, however, there is recognized a certain unity of the geographical and cultural factors in the population under discussion.
SOURCE OF DATA
A detailed report of the various sources of data appears in the introductory report (Bresler, Dunn, Urquhart, and Smith, 1961; preceding, in this issue).
Brown-Pembroke students are required to indicate how many brothers and sisters they have at the time of their acceptance in the University. The total number of children on this entrance record represents the number of live births in the reproductive history of the students' mothers. Two assumptions are made on this point:
1. That this is the completed reproductive history of the mother. (Average age of the mothers whose data were used in the study was 45.3, while the average age of the fathers was 49.8);
2. That the loss of any live born, through either disease, accident, or other reason, is on a random basis and has affected all groups in approximately equal proportions.

A family group (to be defined) was omitted in this study if any adoption of an offspring was recorded or where second marriages were recorded for either parent.
ORGANIZATION OF DATA
The analysis in this investigation was limited to Protestants and Catholics and matings between these two faiths. It was further required that the religion be known for the F2 generation, that is, the Brown-Pembroke alumnus (one individual) , and also for the Fi or parental generation of the Brown-Pembroke alumnus (two individuals). Unknown religious designations, no religious preference, or religious preference other than Protestant or Catholic in any of these three individuals was sufficient cause for omitting the entire family group from this analysis. This procedure of working only with individuals for whom a religious preference is known has been used previously by Hollingshead (1950). Other additional restrictions for various sections will be noted. All seven individuals in the three generations, F2(l), Fx(2), and Px (4-grandparental generation), must have been known to be white. Unknown racial information or known nonwhite racial information was sufficient cause to eliminate the entire family group from the study.
The fertility data are available only for the completed reproductive history of the Fi generation. These data will be presented in three levels of increasing religious homogeneity.
Level I. All Fx and F2 individuals are known to be either Protestant or Catholic. The Px generation may contain other religious preferences, no religious preference, or unknown designations. No restrictions are made upon national

origin of any members in the three generations.
Almost all previous studies relating religious preference to fertility have been done at this level, and it is therefore worth while to compare these results with others.
Level II. All F2, F^ and Px individuals are known to be either Protestant or Catholic. No restrictions are made on national origin.
The population of Protestant X Protestant matings of the Fx generation is divided into two populations designated as "All-Protestant" (A-P) and "Hybrid-Protestant" (H-P). Those Yx Protestant X Protestant matings in which all four individuals of the ~PX or grandparental generation are known to be Protestants were placed into an A-P group. Those Fx Protestant X Protestant matings in which one or more individuals of the Px generation are known to have been Catholic were placed into the H-P group.
The same comments also apply to the Ft Catholic X Catholic matings. If all four Px individuals were Catholic, the mating was placed into the A-C (AllCatholic) category. If, however, one or more individuals in the Px generation were Protestant, the mating was placed into the H-C (Hybrid-Catholic) grouping.
The mating type, 0 0 , as shown in Table 1, represents the A-P group, whereas the A-C group is represented by mating type 15.
The other 14 possibilities represent the "Hybrid" classes. Not all mating combinations were recovered in this study.
Thus six major groups involving Protestant and Catholic matings are distinguished. Two are "all" groups,

14 Bresler

two are "hybrid" groups as determined by the Px level, and the remaining two groups are interfaith matings in the Fx generation.
Level III. All seven individuals of the three generations P^ Flf and F2 have declared religious preference either for Protestantism or for Catholicism. All individuals have been born in the United States and are white.
PRESENTATION OF DATA:
LEVELS I , I I , AND I I I
Level I. In line with previous investigations the Protestant X Protestant (PXP) matings have lower fertility than Catholic X Catholic (CXC) matings (Table 2). Matings are presented as Mother X Father.
Lower fertility in interfaith marriages is not unexpected and has been reported previously. In the Far West, Holmes (1924), using a sample of college men comparable to the F2 in this investigation, found that completed fertility records of their mothers, F^ did indeed show a fertility gradient of C x C > P X P > interfaith marriages. In their well-organized Midwestern sample of Indianapolis, Whelpton and Kiser (1943) and Kiser and Whelpton (1944) found essentially the same trends. Coogan (1946), in a Florida sample, found lower fertility in mixed marriages than in CXC matings. Accordingly, the trends appear to be present throughout the country.
It will be observed that in the PXP matings, 91.3% of the 723 parents are U.S. born, whereas 193 or 73.1% of the of the CXC parents are of U.S. birth (Table 3). It might be expected on a priori grounds that mixed marriages would fall somewhere near the arithmetic average of 82%. However, 90.8% of the parents who enter into mixed mar-

riages, almost as high a percentage as was found in the PXP matings, were born in the U.S. It would appear then that U.S. birth of participating individuals is, if not conducive to, certainly characteristic of mixed marriages.
Level II. As in Level I, the A-P matings have lower fertility than A-C matings (Tables 4 and 5). Fertility in mixed marriages still remains below the A-P matings (Tables 6 and 7). The hybrid group, H-P and H-C, have the lowest fertility of all other groups, and the data suggest that there are four groups of decreasing fertility: A-C> A-P> Mixed PXC and CXP matings>

Hybrid matings of H-P and H-C. The statistical justification for this reasoning may be seen in Figure 1.
The formula for t test is as follows.

The t value between H-C and H-P is .59; between CXP and PXC it is .57.
The spatial arrangements in Figure 1 have the disadvantage in assuming generally equal numbers in each of the four populations. This, of course, is not so. While the fertility mean is lower in the PXC and CXP population than

in the A-P population, the former group has fewer numbers than the latter. For this reason the t score is lower between A-C and P x C -f C x P than it is between A-C and A-P. The decided advantage of the arrangement is the immediate recognition of simultaneous relationships of the populations and the levels of significance among these populations.
Numerous social observers have placed the PXC and C x P matings into one category of mixed marriages so far as fertility is concerned because differences in fertility between these two mating types have rarely, if ever, been significant. Hence, as expected, the averages for these matings are almost the same, and the t score justifies this grouping. The hybrid groups show no significance between themselves, and they, too, are grouped together. The justification

for this grouping is not based upon sociological foundations, since this actually means grouping of PXP matings with CXC matings. Instead, this grouping is based upon similarities in ethnic group considerations, and these will be discussed later.
Mating between U.S.-born and foreignborn individuals usually resulted in lower fertility than matings involving two U.S.-born individuals or two foreignborn individuals (Table 8). The data show this general trend or direction for each religious group. These trends are thus noted, but the numbers of matings are too small to make a conclusive statement.
Level III. In this most homogeneous level in the sample, the sequence of fertility averages resembles those found at Level II: A-C> A-P> P x C and CXP> H-P and H-C (Table 9).

SOCIOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS ON
HUMAN FERTILITY
It is a matter of considerable record that in the white group the average number of live-born children per couple is less today than it was 150 to 200 years ago. This is not to be interpreted as resulting from a steady or consistent decline, because from time to time there have indeed been reversals of the fertility levels. Nonetheless, the lower fertility average per couple today in contrast to former times is generally attributed to the voluntary or personal desires of the husband and wife. This curtailment has been accomplished by various means, but in the United States contraception appears to be the major

factor in keeping families small (Westoff, 1953; Freedman et ah, 1959).
A number of reasons have been advanced for lower fertility in mixed marriages. By far the most important one concerns the alleged instabilities and poor adjustments that result from differences in religions. This in turn, it is supposed, will result in a reduction in fertility. In reviewing the literature up through the early 1940's, Kiser and Whelpton (1944) found that the available studies on the effects of differences in religion on marital adjustment provided conflicting results. A review of the literature since that time leaves the reader with the evaluation that the opinion of Kiser and Whelpton is still appropriate today. The divorce rate for mixed marriages has been regarded as an indicator of poor marital adjustment. However, Landis (1949) and Scheinfeld (1960) have commented that the divorce rate is a poor index of success or failure in marriage because it does not give a true picture of marital happiness. Furthermore, divorce rate data do not take into account the levels of toleration toward marital unhappiness.
It could be granted that in a population of mixed marriages there probably exists a slightly higher level of marital unhappiness than in a population of nonmixed marriages. This unhappiness may in turn result in lower fertility. But one thing appears certain. There is no evidence on hand which indicates the existence of large-scale marital maladjustments in mixed marriages in all parts of the country, in almost all social strata, and under almost all economic conditions. Nor is there any knowledge that these maladjustments are the demonstrable cause of considerable lowered fertility.

18 Bresler

Another possibility relating mixed marriages to lowered fertility concerns the view toward contraception. Whelpton and Kiser (1943) suggest that Catholics involved in mixed marriages tend to be those who have departed more easily from orthodox attitudes toward contraception. This view is in order and there is little to contest it. However, valid as it may be, it does not explain why fertility in mixed marriages is so consistently lower than in PXP matings.
A pilot report of research in progress by Westoff (1959) indicates that individuals of mixed marriages desire a mean number of children which is significantly closer to, but not below, the fertility levels desired by the P X ? matings than those of the CxC matings. This is a fruitful avenue of investigation.
A number of lines of evidence from sociological literature indicates that social and cultural factors contribute to the lowered fertility patterns of mixed marriages. Nevertheless, there is still lacking one or more sociological mechanisms which will consistently explain the lowered fertility pattern of mixed marriages.
THE ETHNIC BACKGROUNDS
The lowered fertility level of interfaith marriages has other complications involving the national origin of the Fj and Px generations.
In a significant number of cases, interfaith marriages are in actuality international origin marriages. The two Px fathers for each Fx mating (Level I) were recorded as originating either from the same country of birth or as originating from different countries of birth. The null hypothesis operating in this instance is that the ratio of like countries to unlike countries of birth is the

same in each of the four religious mating combinations. The hypothesis is rejected, since there is a very substantial increase in the number of unlike combinations in the interfaith marriages (Table 10). The same results and statistical significance would have been shown had the analysis been done between the Pj mothers or either of the two remaining combinations: Px maternal mother vs. Px paternal father or Px maternal father vs. Pj paternal mother.
Previous fertility studies, especially on interfaith marriages, have not taken sufficient cognizance of these national origin aspects.
It is next fruitful to examine the results where religion is held "constant" and the Ft national origin is allowed to vary. From all the family group data available, it was found that 329 family units involving at least seven individuals of three generations had declared a Protestant preference. This population was designated as the Protestant Line. One hundred and ten family units of seven individuals in three generations held Catholic affiliations, and they were regarded as belonging to the Catholic Line.
When the Fx maternal and paternal birthplaces were the same, they were placed into a like national origin category. When they were not the same, they were placed into an unlike category. In Table 11, it may be observed that the average fertility in the like

country category is consistently higher than the fertility level in the unlike country matings. The matings are presented in greater detail in Appendices A and B.
The two foregoing developments would indicate that interfaith marriages involve a large number of interethnic origin matings and these mating types are inherently associated with lowered fertility.
Another line of evidence of ethnic group involvement is the percentage of Fi generation individuals who have come from or have resulted from Px interfaith marriages. In Table 12 it will be observed that the percentage of individuals from mixed marriages increases in exactly the same sequence as was previously shown (Tables 4, 5, 6, and 7) to exist for decreasing fertility in these same four groups.
There is very little difference between the H-P and the H-C groups as regards their mixed or nonmixed derivations. Of the 70 Protestants involved in these marriages, 38, or 54%, came from nonmixed marriages, and 32, or 46%, came from mixed marriages. The group of Catholics involved in these hybrid matings show extremely similar composition. Of the 36 Catholics in the H-C group, 18, or 50%, came from nonmixed matings, and the remaining half came from mixed matings. There is hardly

any difference between the two "Hybrid" groups on these considerations.
The national origin data on the Px generation in the H-P and H-C groups provide essentially the same trend as indicated in Table 10; that is, an extremely large contingent of these "hybrid" groups involve mixed ethnic origins.
To sum up: It has been shown that interfaith marriages are not only interreligious marriages, but they are also by and large inter-national origin marriages. Lowered fertility, it would appear, is a characteristic of mixed ethnic origin matings.
DISCUSSION
In the past 300 years, many human isolates have broken down and their members have been more generally distributed into different and in many instances larger breeding populations. While, in the main, human evolution

20 Bresler

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:26 08 December 2015

is towards or in the direction of a worldwide intraspecific breeding population, it is not likely that the human species shall reach this end point in the foreseeable future. While it is probably true that there does exist a larger force or movement in the breaking down of isolates, there are also certain signs that new isolates are being built up or, in this case, segregated.
As Howells (1960) points out, there are a number of instances where national borders are "slamming shut." This may be politically questionable in these times, but it certainly is a sound genetic procedure for the isolation of breeding populations. In the U.S., processes of isolation are also in operation. Kennedy (1943) and Hollingshead (1950) indicate that strict national origin endogamy is loosening, but this is being accompanied by a building-up process along religious endogamy. A recent review on the attitudes of religious leaders toward interfaith marriages ranged from mild to vigorous ·opposition to such marriages (Ehrlich, 1960). On the other hand there are references in the Ehrlich article that suggest that interfaith marriages are probably increasing.
Demonstrable biological changes have been shown in populations which were isolated for religious purposes (Glass, Sachs, Jahn, and Hess, 1952; Dunn and Dunn, 1957).
In numerous respects the present investigation has bearing upon this continual dissolution and formation of isolates.
Interfaith marriages bring together in a greater degree than unifaith marriages the elements from diverse ethnic groups. The information from this study and others previously cited indicates that ·when comparing the fertility levels of

two or more populations, the population which has the highest percentage or contingent of interethnic group matings is more likely to have the lower fertility level. This observation appears to be valid whether the ethnic groups are based upon religious or national origins.
The reasons for this lowered fertility are not completely understood at this time. Three future avenues of research are indicated.
a) Sociological. It would be well to investigate the sociological mechanisms which apply not only to interfaith marriages but also to inter-national origin marriages. It is'not clear from previous sociological literature whether lowered fertility within a population is attributable to religious factors, ethnic group considerations, or a combination of both factors.
b) Psychological. It would be well to explore the emotional content of interethnic group matings. What, for example, are the relationships of emotional stress of these mixed matings to abor tions and fertility?
c) Genetic. It would be well to explore the ramifications of the inordinate amount of genetic "mixing" in interfaith or interethnic group marriages. The matings have brought together genetic elements from diverse gene pools. Is there, for example, such a phenomenon as higher reproductive wastage and lowered fertility due to the increased population heterozygosity taking place in interethnic group matings?
The problem of lowered fertility in interethnic origin matings is probably more complex than was hitherto suspected.

Population Fertility Levels

804 Brown-Pembroke alumni supplied data on the religious preference, national origin, and racial designation for themselves (F2generation--1 individual), their parents (Fx generation--2 individuals) , and their grandparents (Pi generation--4 individuals). The number of siblings which they indicated on their freshman entrance applications was taken asthe completed fertility recordof their parents.
2. The data were analyzed for 615 family groups (seven individuals) who held preferences for Protestantism or Catholicism. All individuals under discussion were white.
3. Catholic matings showed thehighest fertility levels, followed by Protestant matings, and lastly by interfaith marriages.
4. Thesocial factors which could be responsible for reduced fertility in interfaith marriages were examined. It is

pointed out that these factors do not adequately explain this consistentphenomenon of reduced fertility in these matings.
5. It was shown that interfaith marriages are in most cases inter-national origin matings. The inadequacies of viewing interfaith fertility data from an exclusively religious viewpoint are discussed.
6. In one series the religious preference was held "constant" for the seven individuals in the three generations, and a Protestant Line and a Catholic Line were developed. In both series, matings between individuals of like national origins showed higher fertility than matings involving individuals of different national origins.
7. The relationship of lowered fertility in interethnic origin matings is quite complex, and three avenues for future research in this area have been suggested.
