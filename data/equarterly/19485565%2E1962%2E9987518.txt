A DISQUIETING FEATURE o f t h e SOCial
scene in northwest Europe and in North America for the past century has been the negative correlation of social class and educational status with average family size. This has been dismaying to those interested in education. Not only is high intelligence, as measured by intelligence tests, most often found among the children of the upper occupational classes, but highly intelligent children from these classes are more often willing to stay on at school for advanced education. Evidence for this in Britain is given in the report of the English Central Advisory Council for Education, entitled "Early School Leaving," 1954, and the report of the Scottish Council for Research In Education, entitled "Eleven-year olds grow up" (Macpherson, 1958). In the 1947 survey of the intelligence of Scottish 11-year-old school children, it was found that among the sample of over 1,000 given a TermanMerrill test, about 1 in 3 of the children whose fathers were in the professions or were large scale employers were "high scorers," that is, had intelligence quotients of more than 132, but only about 1 in 40 of the children whose fathers were in semi-skilled or unskilled jobs

were "high scorers" (Macpherson, 1958). This negative correlation of occupa-
tional class and educational status with family size has also been disquieting to those interested in eugenics. It is improbable, in countries where there is free movement between the classes, that the differences in average intelligence between children in different social classes are entirely attributable to environmental influence. It is therefore possible that a negative correlation may result in a loss of genes predisposing to socially valuable qualities such as intelligence and energy.
Various explanations have been given for the negative correlation. R. A. Fisher suggested that genes for intelligence and for infecundity have become associated in the upper social classes. But the fall in average size in all social classes has been much too rapid in northwest Europe and the United States of America to be attributed to any physiological mechanisms affecting fecundity, that is, the capacity to have children. Similarly theoretical models, such as those of Penrose, whereby genetic equilibrium for the distribution of intelligence is maintained by the greatest fertility of those of near average intelligence, with lesser fertility at either extreme, do not appear closely related to the situation today. The simplest and best supported explanation of the negative correlation is that

it is due to differences in the degree to which parents are successful in planning the size of their families. The more able and educated make more effective use of the various methods available, natural and artificial, of regulating conception. But the practice of planning family size is spreading through the community (Lewis-Faning, 1949; Freedman, Whelpton and Campbell, 1959); therefore, if this explanation of the negative correlation is correct, one might expect it to diminish and perhaps to disappear. There is now evidence that where families are all planned the negative correlation not only disappears but becomes positive, and that parents of highest occupational class and educational status have the largest families.
In the national census for England and Wales for 1951, this trend is clearly seen among the wives of men in the nonmanual "white collar" occupations. The figures shown in Table 1 are for women under 50 married for 10-14 years. The wives of men in the major professions and of owners and managers of large businesses, who form 4% of the whole, were having larger families than the wives of men in the minor professions with small businesses and the wives of shopkeepers (who together form 16% of the whole), and these in turn are having more children than the wives of men in clerical occupations (who form 5% of the whole).
In these non-manual occupations, then, there is a positive correlation. The wives of the manual workers, however, still show the usual negative correlation, the wives of skilled workers (40% of the whole) having fewer children than the wives of semi-skilled workers (11%of the whole), who in turn have fewer children than the wives of unskilled workers (9% of the whole). No figures are yet avail-

able for this year's Census of England and Wales.
Very much the same trend to a reversal of the usual negative correlation may be seen in the 1950 census figures for the U. S. A., though there the occupational groupings and the proportion in each group are rather different (Grabill, Kiser and Whelpton, 1958). This is shown in Table 2. In the non-manual groups who are more than half the total, there is a positive correlation of occupational class and family sizes; wives of professional men and proprietors are having larger families than the wives of clerks, though the correlation is still negative in the manual workers. In the last column of Table 2, the proportional changes in family size in the U. S. A. since the 1940 Census are shown, and it is noteworthy that not only has the overall negative correlation diminished but this is in part due to an actual increase in family size most marked in the professional group (12%), while there has been a 5% to 6% fall in the size of family of the manual workers. A similar trend is seen in the French Census for 1954 in which, for couples married 10 years, the professional group had larger families than any other non-manual occupational group. The wives of men in the "professions libres" had in fact achieved the remarkably high average family size of 2.5 after 10 years of marriage.
Smaller scale studies support these national findings. An interesting study of British wives who were University graduates, based on a sample of over 1,000 (Hubback, 1955), showed a definite positive correlation between average family size and academic achievement within this highly selected group. There was a consistent diminution in family size as one passed from those with first class honors to those with second class honors

and those with third class honors to those with a pass degree only. In Sweden there is evidence that both the marriage rate and the fertility of matriculants has increased and is now higher than the national average (Moberg, 1950). In the U. S. A., the biographical information on the eminent men listed in "Who's Who" shows that their fertility has remained remarkably constant for the past 50 years, and that this has been above the national average for those born since 1910.
A further guide to future trends is given by surveys in which young married women were asked how many children they expect to have. A nation-wide sample of white women in the United States were asked these questions in 1955 (Freedman, Whelpton and Campbell, 1959). The replies of the youngest group, aged 18 to 24, a sample of over 500, are summarized in Table 3. The average size of the families which the wives expect to have was 3.4 in the upper white collar group, 3.1 in the lower white collar group, 2.9 in the upper manual group, and 3.1 in the lower manual group. The rural group show a higher expected fertility, but this is a separate consideration. Again classified by wife's educational status, the expected average family size was 3.5 for the college-educated, 3.1 for those who had four years at high school, 3.0 for those who had one to three years at high school, and 3.3 for those who had no high school education. These are, of course, expectations; it may be that the young wives of men in the upper white collar group and the young college-educated wives were being over-optimistic about their ability to achieve the size of family they wanted; the less educated may have been unduly pessimistic about their ability to limit the size of their families to the number planned. But it is clear that in

terms of wives' expectations there may be by the 1980's in the U. S. A. a positive correlation between occupational and educational status and average family size. A recent similar study carried out in 1958 in West Germany (Freedman, Baumert and Bolte, 1959) also showed a U-shaped relationship of expected family size to occupation and educational

status, though the average expected family size and the variation between different groups was smaller. The greatest expected family size was for the wives of men in the professions.
If this trend I have been discussing continues and a positive correlation between occupational class and educational status and average family size does develop throughout these communities, there is, I think, no doubt of the gain from the viewpoint of the educationalist. There will be a higher proportion of highly intelligent children and more who are willing to take advanced courses of education. It is probable, but not certain, that such a correlation would also lead to a rise in the proportion of individuals in the population who have genotypes favoring the development of high intelligence and other socially valuable qualities.
In conclusion it should be noted that, whatever the present trend in northwest Europe and the United States of America, planned family size, much more than natural fecundity, is influenced by social and economic factors. A clear example

was the drop in the birth rate in the
early 1930's. While the ultimate decision
on how many children they should have
must rest with the individual couple,
one measure of a healthy society is that
its citizens best endowed with socially
valuable qualities should be planning
larger-than-average families.
