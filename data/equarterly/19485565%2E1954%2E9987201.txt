GENETIC DIVERSITY IN

THE PEOPLE OF WESTERN INDIA*

INVESTIGATIONS CONCERNING distribution of
genetical traits in man were few and far between in India, before we started our studies on human blood groups in Bombay in the year 1944. Most of the larger of series of data on ABO blood groups of Hindus from different regions of India are summarized in Table 1.

Our next step was to study the distribution of ABO blood groups in two Marathispeaking castes of the Hindu Community residing in the Bombay State. This was of

i Based on blood bank data from: Red Cross Society, King Edward Memorial Hospital, Wadia Maternity Hospital, and Tata Memorial Hospital.

The data on Hindus in Bombay were collected from four different blood banks. There was no significant difference in the distribution of ABO blood groups from these four different sources in Bombay (x2 = 14.54, P = 0.11). This however, did not necessarily mean that there was no internal heterogeneity in Hindus residing in the same region. The data from different regions of the country showed highly significant differences (heterogeneity j 2 = 127.8 for Hindus from North India, Uttar Pradesh, Bengal, Bombay and Madras, P < 0.0001) showing an interesting gradient of gene B from North to South.

special interest as Hindus all over the country are divided into a large number of welldefined castes and sub-castes whose members are forbidden by social custom to marry outside their own group. This social custom has a very great authority even to this day. Such "in-marrying" groups have been properly termed as endogamous groups or Mendelian populations.
Marathas and Mahars were the two Marathi-speaking groups selected for this purpose. Marathas are largely cultivators constituting about 40 per cent of the Marathi-speaking people. Mahars form a large section of the untouchables who constitute about 10 per cent of the Marathispeaking people. The distribution of ABO blood groups in these two castes is given in

castes and sub-castes is not reported in all. Latest available figures of these four endogamous groups in the Bombay State from the census reports of 1931 are given above. The group M.K. is spread over the entire Marathi-speaking area. The group C.K.P. is concentrated in western districts near Bombay, the group D.B. is found largely in the southern districts, and the group K.B. in the districts of Konlcan and in other urban areas.
These endogamous groups are divided in mutually exclusive sections, whose members are forbidden to marry within their own sections. An exogamous section derives its name from some mythical ancestor to whom all the members of the section own allegiance and are in many castes supposed to have descended in the male line. This rule, incidently, prohibits paternal cousin marriages. There are 15 exogamous sections in K.B., 24 in C.K.P. and more than 80 in M.K. There are variations in the custom of non-paternal cousin marriages among these groups. No such marriage is permitted in K.B. and D.Y.B. On the other hand, not only are such marriages permitted in D.R.B., G.K.P. and M.K. but extravagant emphasis is put on a marriage of a boy to his maternal uncle's daughter. This is the reason for the high frequency of this type of cousin marriages reported earlier in Marathas. (D.R.B. and D.Y.B. are two sub-castes of D.B., which were investigated separately but have been pooled here for convenience of presentation.)
No critical information is available about the origin and evolution of any of these four groups. There is some evidence to suggest that D.B. and M.K. have been residing in this region for a long period of time, Marathas probably dating back to the pre-Christian era. C.K.P. can be traced in this region from the 10th century onwards, whereas there is no reference to K.B. up to the 16th century. M.K. and K.B. were the ruling dynasties successively in the 17th and 18th centuries. Until the rise

of K.B. to power, they held a low social position among the Brahmans of Desh and were known as spies. Even after several generations of power and wealth, some of the classes of Brahmans refused to eat with them or to officiate at their ceremonies.
Suitable antisera were available at the laboratory to study ABO, AXA2, MN and Rh blood groups. T o this battery of tests, two more genetical traits were added: (1) taste reaction to phenyl-thio-carbamide and (2) color blindness of the red-green type. Field work was organized through some society, school or an influential person of the group concerned. The group K.B. and C.K.P. included 100 men and 100 women. One hundred men were examined for each one of the groups D.R.B. and D.Y.B. Two hundred boys of the group M.K. had already been studied for A ^ B O , MN and Rh blood groups. Another sample of 200 individuals was therefore tested for taste reactions to p.t.c. and color vision. Only unrelated individuals were taken for study. Table 5 contains a summary of the data relating to the distribution of these genetical traits in the four endogamous groups.
No significant difference was found in the distribution of various genetical traits in D.R.B. and D.Y.B. These groups were, therefore, combined together in group D.B. for further calculations. Women of the group K.B. and C.K.P. had normal color vision and were kept out of further considération.
There are certain interesting features of Table 5. K.B. has a comparatively high frequency of 0 blood group and C.K.P. has a high frequency of A2. Distribution of Rh factor has a range from 1.5 per cent negative in M.K. to 10 per cent negative in C.K.P. M.K. and C.K.P. have a remarkably low frequency of tasters of p.t.c. The distributions of American Whites and Negroes for the same genetical traits are given at the bottom of Table 5 for the sake of comparison.

ried out for the six possible pairs of four endogamous groups and each genetical trait separately. "Values of y2 and their statistical significance are given in Table 6.
There is no significant difference in the distribution of any trait between the groups D.B. and M.K. Both of these groups differ significantly from K.B. in the distribution of ABO blood groups and from C.K.P. in the distribution of AiA2 and Rh. D.B. further differs from C.K.P. in the distribution of taste reactions to p.t.c. The greatest differences are found between K.B. and C.K.P. as they differ from each other in ABO, A ^ , Rh and p.t.c.
The above evidence substantiates in a broad way the scanty historical information about these groups. It shows similarity between D.B. and M.K. in spite of the fact that socially D.B. and K.B. are supposed to

be closer. It also shows a dissimilarity of C.K.P. from the other three groups supporting the hypothesis that it is a migrant group. However, it does not throw much light on the position of K.B.
The pattern of genetic variation among the endogamous groups revealed by this study has shown that the Indian castes are remarkably suitable for a number of investigations in hereditary diseases and defects, some of which are already underway at our laboratory in Bombay.
