Social scientists have long been aware that when they ask a person to supply information on age, either his own or that of some other person known to him, the information they receive is often far from accurate. Misstatements of age, in fact, occur for a number of reasons. To cite just a few: (1) many people tend to round off to the nearest age ending in 0 or 5 (a tendency that may be due either to ignorance of exact age or to some vague tendency toward orderliness); (2) a natural inclination to overstate when nearing some socially significant age (such as ages 21 and 65 in the United States); (3) a tendency to understate age in an effort to "preserve one's youth" as middle age approaches; and (4) the converse tendency to overstate age in later years, due likely to the traditional veneration of old age. Myers (1965), for example, has recently suggested that the actual number of centenarians in the United States today is only about a third as high as the number reported in the 1960 census.
The most common source of error in age reporting, however, appears to be the tendency to overselect ages ending in particular digits, such as 0 or 5, while avoiding ages ending in other digits, thus causing successive patterns of "heaping" throughout an age distribution (Zelnick, 1961; Taeuber and Hansen, 1964; Zelnick, 1964). In an effort to explain patterns of heaping in age reporting (or in the reporting of numerical data in

general), Stanley H. Turner (1958) has suggested that persons will tend to overreport those digits that are multiples of the divisors of the base of the number system, while underreporting those digits that are not multiples of the divisors of the base of the number system. The reasoning behind this suggestion is that people will generally give accurate numerical reports if they can but will estimate if they do not know what the correct response should be; and when a person estimates numerical values, it is only natural that he should do so in terms of the basic units provided by his number system.
If the Turner hypothesis is correct, knowledge of the base of a number system should enable a person to predict the pattern of heaping that will occur in response to requests for numerical data. To illustrate, consider our number system, with its base of ten. (This is a system with which most people throughout the world are familiar.) The divisors of this base are 10, 5, and 2; hence, according to the hypothesis in question, heaping should occur at multiples of these three numbers. More explicitly, Turner suggests that heaping should characterize these numbers in order of their magnitude: numbers divisible by 10 will exhibit the greatest heaping; numbers not divisible by 10 but divisible by 5 will rank second; and numbers divisible by neither 10 nor 5 but divisible:by 2 will rank last in order of preference.

Given the preceding, one would expect responses to requests for age information to show greatest preference for ages ending in 0, second preference for ages ending in 5, and third preference to ages ending in the digits 2, 4, 6, and 8. Since ages ending in these six digits would tend to be overselected, it follows that ages ending in 1, 3, 7, or 9 (i.e., those digits that are not multiples of the divisors of the base of the number system in question) would be avoided or underselected.
The order of digit preference or avoidance can be specified even further. Since the preferential digits 4 and 6 are right next to the even more preferential digit 5, one would expect them to attract less heaping than the preferred digits 2 and 8. Similarly, since the digits 9 and 1 are on either side of the most preferred digit, one could predict that they will be avoided more than digits 3 and 7. On this basis, assuming the validity of the Turner hypothesis, the following rank order of digit preference/avoidance would be expected tooccur:
0 (Most preferred)
O
2,8 4,6 3,7 1,9 (Most avoided)
TESTING T H E HYPOTHESIS
Of the various techniques that have been developed to measure the extent of digit preference or avoidance, the most well known is Myers' "blending" method (Myers, 1940). This was the basic procedure used by Turner in testing his hypothesis with United States census data from 1880 to 1950, and it is the procedure used in the present verification of this hypothesis. Specifically, Myers Indexes of Preference were computed for 31 countries, for which single

year of age data were available from recent censuses (see Table 6 of the 1962 Demographic Yearbook of the United Nations). In deriving the Index of Preference, it is assumed that where age data are completely accurate, the number of persons with age ending in each of the ten terminal digits in the "blended population" will be equal to 10.0% of the total "blended population." If the proportion at any given digit exceeds 10.0% (i.e., a positive deviation), it indicates digit preference; whereas a proportion of less than 10.0% (i.e., a negative deviation) would indicate digit avoidance. These indexes (defined as one-half of the sum of the absolute deviation scores for each of the ten terminal digits), as well as the specific digit deviations, are presented in Table 1.
Although there are occasional exceptions (particularly among those countries where age reporting is apparently more accurate and where purely chance factors may be responsible for the minor deviations that do exist), the general pattern revealed in Table 1 would clearly tend to substantiate the Turner hypothesis. Moreover, some of the exceptions would actually serve to add further support. The case of Puerto Rico, for example (which indicates a relatively strong preference for the digits 9 and 4, with a corresponding avoidance of digit 0), is a reflection of the fact that the 1960census of the United States and its outlying areas asked for date of birth rather than current age and obtained age by subtracting the year and quarter year of birth from the census date (April 1, 1960). Since the census date encompassed only one-fourth of the year 1960, threefourths of those persons who reported a birth year ending in 0 would be assigned an age ending with the digit 9. Thus Puerto Rico actually does exhibit the expected pattern of digit prefer-

ence, but the preference is directed toward year of birth rather than current age (U. S. Bureau of theCensus, 1963; Zelnick, 1964).
To permit a clearer view of the heaping patterns disclosed in Table 1, the average deviation wascalculated for each of the ten terminal digits for those 18 countries where it was felt that biasesin age reporting were particularly great (i. e., those countries where the overall Index of Preference score was 2.5 or more). These average deviations, which were multiplied by 100 to remove fractions and facilitate comparison, arepresented in Table 2. Inspection of these date leaves little doubt that ages ending in 0 are selected far more often than other ages (twice asoften asages ending in 5, the next most preferred digit). Similarly, among the remaining digits, the average deviation ispositive only for those ages ending in 2 and8; whereas the negative deviations (which indicate avoidance) are markedly less forthe digits 4 and 6 and greatest for the digits 9 and 1.

CONCLUSION
In spite of the occasional exceptions and in spite ofarather wide range of var-

iation in theextent of digit preference
and avoidance among the several coun-
tries considered here, it can be concluded
that the data presented in Tables 1 and
2 constitute a confirmation of Turner's
hypothesis pertaining to the patterns of
heaping that might be expected in the
reporting of numerical data among the
various countries ofthe world. If recom-
mendations for additional research are
in order, it maybe suggested that future
tests of this hypothesis seek to determine
if theexpected pattern with regard to
census age statistics characterizes all
segments of the various populations, or
if there are more or less significant differ-
ences associated with such variables
as sex,color, or urban-rural residence.
In addition, it might be worthwhile to
see if the Turner hypothesis issubstanti-
ated by age data reported on otherde-
mographic documents--particularly on birth and death certificates.1
