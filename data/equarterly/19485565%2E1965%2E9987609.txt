TYPES OF DEMOGRAPHIC DATA OF POSSIBLE RELEVANCE TO POPULATION GENETICS

CLYDE V. RISER

This paper is designed to provide a few examples of types of demographic data and population trends that may be of relevance to population genetics. It is concerned chiefly with measurable characteristics obtainable for the census and other sources, with trends and differentials in marriage patterns including consanguineous marriages and assortive mating, and with natality trends and differentials by selected characteristics. The two other components of population change, mortality and migration, are discussed only briefly and in general terms.
MEASURABLE CHARACTERISTICS
The measurable population characteristics of more or less relevance to population genetics include the basic classifications in census data and vital statistics, such as age, sex, marital status, age at marriage, residence (rural-urban, region), migration, color or race, fertility (fecundity) and socioeconomic status (McKusic et al., 1964).
The oldest series of classifications by socioeconomic status in this country are those relating to occupation of the head of the household. These have conventionally carried a separation of farm and nonfarm occupations. The farm group is conventionally subdivided into the farmer and farm laborer categories. The nonfarm occupations are classified to afford some degree of continuum of status ranging from professional to unskilled laborer categories. The gradation is by no means perfect. Each broad group

contains some irregularities. The professional class, for instance, contains some poorly educated teachers and preachers. The proprietary and managerial class contains some who operate on a shoestring and some who manage huge enterprises.
Educational attainment of the person is a valuable criterion of socioeconomic status. It has been asked in the United States Census since 1940. Prior to that time there were single questions on whether the person could read and write. As an index of socioeconomic status, educational attainment has two valuable advantages over occupation and income. The amount of a person's formal educational attainment becomes a virtually unchanging attribute after about age 25; the amount of educational attainment has similar meaning for wife and husband and for the married and unmarried persons of either sex. For these reasons it makes more sense to compute net reproduction rates and cohort fertility rates by educational attainment than by occupational or income status.
The characteristics mentioned above are those utilized in census and vital statistics systems. They have varying degrees of relevance to the student of population genetics--if for no reason other than to hold constant the demographic variable under consideration. Several characteristics that are not available in official data but have been developed or studied under other auspices include measures of contraceptive practice, desires and expectations regarding num-

ber of children, and various types of test scores such as those regarding intelligence and personality.
The possibility of classifying married couples according to their contraceptive history is of relevance to population genetics. The techniques for this classification have been rather highly developed in a long series of surveys and studies carried out in this country and other parts of the world since 1930. Some of the early studies related to special populations such as patients in maternity hospitals, patients of birth control clinics, and relief recipients. The extension of the studies to more general populations has indicated rather conclusively that under appropriate conditions women will impart detailed and highly personal information regarding their pregnancy and contraceptive histories. They will give this information not only to medical doctors, nurses, and social workers, but also to tactful female interviewers in house-to-house surveys. This is not to say that available data on contraceptive practice are highly accurate. There is evidence that women fail to recall their past contraceptive practices with full precision (Westoff, et al., 1963).
Several recent surveys have included questions on number of births expected by the end of the childbearing period and/or during the next five years. Tests have indicated that the latter type of question has high predictive value insofar as average natality per women is concerned but not with respect to performance of individual women.
Perhaps one of the fondest dreams of the population geneticist is to secure a simple and workable yet reliable and meaningful direct measure of native intelligence.

Intelligence Quotient
As for intelligence tests these were developed largely by the use of captive audiences, notably school children. Aptitude tests have been developed for applicants for positions. There has not yet been much effort to apply intelligence tests in house-to-house surveys. Although much progress has been made by psychologists in the delineation of personality types, efforts to adapt the techniques to field studies and to relate psychological variables to fertility planning and to size of planned family have thus far yielded rather disappointing results. This matter is discussed in a later section.
TRENDS AND DIFFERENTIALS IN
MARRIAGE
Differentials by Country
The prevalence of marriage varies from the low proportions ever married in Ireland to virtual universality of marriage in India and other underdeveloped countries. Among the modern Western countries the range is from the low proportion of Ireland to the high proportion of the United States.
Age at Marriage
Among whites in this country there have been trends since World War II toward more marriage, earlier marriage, and the concentration of the childbearing in the first ten years of married life. There has also been a tendency for the wife to enter or reenter the labor force, at least on a part-time basis, after the family is completed.
The proportion ever married among white females 20-24 years of age was 58 in 1940, 68 in 1950, and 73 in 1960. Among males 20-24 years of age the

proportion ever married was 26 in 1940, 40 in 1950, and 47 in 1960. Among nonwhites the proportions ever married at these ages were lower in 1960 than in 1950. Among nonwhite females 2024 years of age the percentages ever married were 63 in 1940, 69 in 1950, and 64 in 1960. Among nonwhite males of this age, the corresponding figures were 61, 45, and 43 respectively.
Proportions Ever Married bySocioeconomic Status
In general there is an inverse relation of percentages married to education insofar as the broad groups, elementary school, high school, and college are concerned. There is also an inverse relation in the detailed classification of the high school and college groups. However, among women of elementary school status a rather marked direct relation of marriage to grade completed is discerned (Table 1).
The relatively low proportion ever married at both extremes of the educational scale, especially for the whites, may be noted in Table 1. Those having

completed five or more years of college and those who did not complete even one year of school exhibit conspicuously low percentages ever married. Both are select groups. Those with five or more years of college probably in large part are women who elected to do graduate work in preparation for academic or other careers because chances at matrimony were absent or not acceptable. Those who never attended school as much as one year doubtless are composed largely of women with mental or physical handicaps or those reared in homes and communities of extreme poverty, isolation, and cultural disadvantage.
A relatively low amount of marriage among women in Who's Who still exists, but there is a definite trend toward more marriage among the younger women in Who's Who (Frank and Kiser, 1965). In contrast, among males college education is no deterrent to eventual marriage, although it may bring some delay. Kirk found that the proportion ever marrying is higher among men in Who's Who than among men of comparable age in the general population (Kirk, 1957).

Consanguineous Marriage: Prevalence by country
Studies of consanguineous marriage usually have been restricted to relatively small regions, which do not provide good bases for estimates of prevalence by total countries. Freire-Maia recently attempted estimates by country but cautions the reader that the "data are not strictly comparable, and inferences from these data must be cautiously drawn." In his arrangement of countries according to estimated frequency of firstcousin marriages (as percentages of total marriages) he places Japan at the top with 5 to 6 per cent. Brazil is next with 2 to 3 per cent. Puerto Rico and Poland follow with 1 to 2 per cent. The category 0.5 to 1 per cent includes Denmark, France, Italy, Northern Ireland and Uruguay. The estimate is 0.1 to 0.5 for England, Germany, and Holland. The United States stands in lowest position with under 0.1.
As for previous prevalence in the United States, Freire-Maia cited Dean, who found that first-cousin marriages were about 5 per cent of the total in Iowa in 1903. He also cited a study by Arner who estimated thatfirst-cousin marriages were about 2.8 per cent of the total in New York State in the 18th century. He assumed a rate of about 0.5 per cent for the "more progressive American communities" (Freire-Maia, 1957).
There are several limitations to the studies such as those cited by FreireMaia. In some cases, the numbers are too small to yield reliable results. Sometimes it is not clear whether the data cited by the authors relate to the time the study was made or to the time the marriages were contracted. Sometimes the time span considered is unduly long and might be one of changing conditions.

Finally, there is sometimes uncertainty about the denominators. In some countries the existence of parish records provides good bases. Perhaps in other cases the series may have been in part the marriages recalled by the investigator or by local characters with whom he talked. In such cases, there may be bias arising from the greater likelihood of remembering the cousin marriages than the others.
The question of probability is fundamental in studies of cousin marriages as indeed it is in genetics and demography in general. Taking Dahlberg's work on cousin marriages as a point of departure, Hajnal computed his own series of mating probabilities and theoretical distribution of first-cousin marriages and compares these with observed distributions. He assumed an isolate stationary population and suggests that his theoretical or model estimates might be used when data are nonexistent or suspect (Hajnal, 1964).
Assortive Mating
In a general sense assortive mating may be defined as a divergence from random mating. Karl Pearson's comparisons of husbands and wives with respect to stature, span, length of forearm, and length of life were pioneering studies of assortive mating by physical traits. They were also significant in that they afforded a pioneering use of his own recently developed coefficients of correlation. He found a coefficient of correlation between the spouses of about 0.28 for stature and about 6.2 for the other two traits (Beckman and Elston, 1962).
As for assortive mating by cultural traits, studies have indicated a tendency for "like to marry like" with respect to religion and national origin. As for

76

assortive mating according to personality, there are diverse theories. Some sociologists emphasize the importance of similar personalities of the potential mates, but Robert F. Winch emphasizes the importance of "complementary needs."
Assortive mating by color is still predominant, despite some probable increase in Negro-white dating and marriages, and despite the racial mixtures since time immemorial. However, there are areas such as Brazil in which color is of relatively small consequence in marriage.
Assortive mating by socioeconomic status is also strongly entrenched despite the many exceptions that provide themes for the movies and story books. For an accurate test of the departure from random mating by education one would need detailed data by age and education regarding marriages in relation to population at risk during specific periods.
The Census publication Women By Number of Children Ever Born, based upon the 1960 Census provides cross tabulations by education of the wife and education of the husband for white women, 35-44 and 45-54 years of age, married once and husband present. These cross classifications have been used as bases for estimating the extent of assortive mating by educational status.
Several characteristics of the data should be mentioned at the outset. In the first place, the basic data relate to highest grade or year of school completed. In the second place, the published cross classifications relate, for the most part, to categories. Specifically, they involve six educational groups, not single grades or years. Finally, the data presented here relate to white women of specified ages and their husbands in unbroken first marriages (i.e., married once, husband present). Thus, we can

analyze the educational status of husbands of women 35-44 and 45-54 years of age and of given educational attainment. However, when we turn the data around to examine the educational status of wives of the men of specific educational attainment, the husbands are of indeterminate age. The reference group is simply that of husbands of women aged 35-44 or 45-54.
In analyzing the data for indications of assortive mating, the first step was to prepare percentage distributions of the husbands by educational attainment for each age-educational group of wives available. A similar process was followed in observing the educational distribution of wives of men of given educational attainment. For each educational level of one spouse, the percentage of cases in which the other spouse was of same educational attainment was obtained.
Under random mating by educational attainment the percentage distribution of husbands by educational attainment would be the same within each educational group of wives considered, and vice versa. The actual educational attainment of all white males 40-44 years of age (regardless of marital status) was used as the "expected" educational distribution of the husbands of women 35-44 years of age. This age group was chosen under the assumption that grooms tend to be 3-4 years older than brides. The single, widowed, and divorced were included because it was thought that by virtue of assortive mating the base itself might be influenced by restriction to the married men. Similarly, the educational distribution of all white males 50-54 was used as the "expected" distribution of the husbands of women 45-54 under assumptions of random mating. Thus, for each educational

Vol. 12, No. 2

77

group of wives it was possible to compute the percentage of husbands of "same" educational level on both an "observed" and "expected" bases, as given in Section A of Table 2.
The distributions of all white women 35-44 and 45-54 by educational attainment were used as the "expected" distributions of the wives at each educational level of husbands. The resulting data are in Section B of Table 2. The method is crude, but it is believed that the excess of the "observed" over the "expected" proportion of cases with spouses of the "same" educational attainment affords a fairly good indication of the extent of assortive mating.
The results emphasize the reality of assortive mating by educational attainment. The "observed" proportions of couples in which the wife and husband are of "same" educational attainment

are consistently and substantially larger than the proportions that would be expected on the basis of random mating. This is true at each educational level of the wife or husband.
Assortive mating by education is conspicuously strong at the extremes, according to the data. Thus, among white married women 35-44 years of age who had never completed elementary school (less than 8 years) the husbands were of this educational level in 58.2 per cent of the cases. Since only 13.7 per cent of the husbands would be "expected" in this category under random mating, the excess is 44.5 percentage points. Likewise, among women completing four or more years of college 59.9 per cent of the husbands were college graduates. In this case, the "observed" percentage of same education is 49.2 percentage

points above the "expected" (Section A,
Table 2).
In the classifications specific with reference to the husband's education (Section B, Table 2), the observed proportions of wives of the same educational attainment as their husbands were higher at the High School 4 than at the College 4+ levels (husbands' education). However, much of the relatively high proportion of High School 4 husbands with wives of similar education would have been "expected" under random mating.
Thus, whereas assortive mating is strongly in evidence at all educational levels, it is particularly strong at the extremes. Comparison of the two age groups affords no indication of any systematic trend in selective mating by education over the ten years from about 1930 to 1940, the approximate midpoints of marriage dates represented by the two age groups of wives. It is possible, however, that there was some increase in assortive mating at the College 4 + level.
The present data afford no confirmation of the opinion, sometimes expressed in the literature, that women are likely to "marry up" and the men to "marry down."

TRENDS AND DIFFERENTIALS IN
NATALITY
The trends in natality differentials in the United States from 1950 to 1960 have not all been in the same direction. Apparently there has been a widening of fertility differentials by color and religion and a narrowing by urban-rural residence and socioeconomic status.
By Color
The widening of the differentials by color, especially at ages 35-39, is indicated in Table 3. The differentials in natality by color are smallest in urban areas, intermediate in rural nonfarm areas, and greatest in rural farm areas. Also, the urban-rural differentials in fertility are greater among nonwhites than among whites. It should be noted, however, that the rural farm population now constitutes less than one-tenth of the total.
By Religion
The evidence for the strengthening differential in natality rates by religion comes from private surveys; the decennial census asks no question regarding religion of the individual. The private

surveys show for this country consistently highest fertility rates for Catholics, intermediate rates for Protestants, and lowest rates for the Jews. In a recent article based upon data from 1955, 1960, and 1962 studies, Freedman, Goldberg, and Slesinger report, "In contrast to the contraction of fertility differentials for most of the variables discussed here, religious differences in fertility are large and apparently growing larger" (Freedman, et al., 1963).
By Urban-Rural Residence
The diminishing nature of rural-urban differentials in natality is apparent from Table 4. For both white and nonwhite ever-married women of most age groups within the childbearing span, there were sharp increases in natality from 1950 to 1960, but the percentage increases tended to be larger in urban areas than in rural nonfarm and rural farm areas. The percentage excesses of

the rural rates over the urban rates diminished appreciably over the decade.
By Socioeconomic Status
Available materials suggest that for several decades prior to about 1910 there was a widening of occupational differentials in fertility. During this period the declines in fertility tended to be sharper among the white-collar classes than among the laboring classes (Notestein, 1931; Riser, 1932 and 1933).
It is not possible to pinpoint the precise year of change from widening to narrowing of differentials in natality. However, the relative spread of natality rates by occupational class was much smaller in 1940 than in 1910. The declines in the natality rate during this period were relatively greater in the lower classes than in the upper classes. It is believed that this was due to the permeation of family planning practices to the lower classes. In any event, the

period was one of narrowing differentials in natality by occupational status, and this occurred in the context of general decline in natality.
Since 1940 the narrowing of natality differentials has been continued, but this time in the context of rising natality. The increase in natality that occurred after 1940 have been relatively greater among the socioeconomic classes previously characterized by lowest natality than among the others. In other words, the increases have been relatively greater among the white-collar classes than among the laboring classes. This was true for both decades 1940-1950 and 1950-1960, and the trends by education are similar to those by occupation.
Despite the narrowing that has occurred, natality differentials by occupational and educational status are still well entrenched and they are more

prominent among the nonwhites than among the whites (Table 5).
Intragroup Differences in Natality
Fertility rates among whites are presented in Table 6 for cross-classifications by educational attainment of wives and husbands. The materials are from the same census source as those previously described in Table 2 in respect to assortive mating. The significant finding from these data is that among College 4+ wives natality rates tend to vary directly by educational attainment of the husband. Likewise among husbands of College 4-f status fertility rates of the wives tend to vary directly with their own educational attainment.
As one considers the natality pattern by education of the spouse at sucessively lower educational levels of the other spouse, there is a gradual transition from

direct to indirect relation of education to natality. Thus, among women of under 8th grade status, there is a sharp inverse relation of natality to education of the husband.
Intelligence and Fertility
The relation of family size to intelligence of parents is a question of importance not only to geneticists and demographers, but to all interested in questions of social welfare and public policy. This question has occupied the attention of scientists of the calibre of Francis Galton, Karl Pearson, and R. A. Fisher. Despite certain predilections, each of them contributed toward the study of the problem.
A general limitation of the efforts to relate natality to intelligence is the lack of knowledge of the extent to which I.Q. scores are conditioned by environment. About all we can say with assur-

ance is that they are jointly influenced by genetic and environmental factors. However, the position of many eugenicists today is that whatever may be the mechanism of the transmission of intelligence, a negative relation of natality to intelligence is not a situation which either the geneticist or the social engineer can view with indifference.
Perhaps most of the studies of the problem have been those of relating size of family from which the child came to intelligence test scores of the school child. These have the limitations that (1) the I.Q. relates not to the parents, but to their children; (2) couples with no children are not represented; and (3) there tends to be an undue selection of larger families.
In general, the studies of school children have tended to indicate an inverse relation of intelligence test scores to size of family in which they lived. The continued findings of the inverse relation

of fertility to intelligence quotient led some to predict that the average intelligence of our population would decline. There were estimates of the extent of this decline.
Several years ago, Maxwell and several colleagues in Scotland attempted to test the allegations of decline in average I.Q. by comparing current I.Q. levels of school children of a specific age-grade status with those of comparable groups fifteen years ago. The results indicated not lower, but somewhat higher current average levels of I.Q. than those observed fifteen years previously (Maxwell, 1954).
The dynamic nature of the relation of fertility to intelligence is emphasized by Bajema in his study relating to a sample of 1,144 native whites born during 1916-17 for whom I.Q. scores were available from tests administered to them while they were in the sixth grade in the Kalamazoo Public School System. He found a bimodal relation of I.Q. to intrinsic rate of natural increase. The highest intrinsic rates of natural increase were found for those with I.Q. in excess of 120 and for the I.Q. 80-94 group.
Bajema reported a slight positive relation between I.Q. and mean length of the generation from parent's birth to subject's birth. This is equivalent to a slight negative relation between I.Q. and natality of parents. In contrast, he found a slight positive relation of subject's I.Q. to his own completed size of family.
Bajema concludes by saying, "The equilibrium or slight increase in the frequency of eugenic factors favoring high intelligence is due not to the reproductive success of the average I.Q. groups, but to the counter-balancing effects of the high reproductive rates of the high I.Q. group (>120) and of the low-normal I.Q. group (80-94)." His conclusions

might easily be challenged on the basis of the small numbers involved in his subgroups. Nevertheless, he has provided an example of a method of approach and of the types of data needed that might well be followed by other students (Bajema, 1963).
Personality Types
There are various reasons for interest in the relation of personality characteristics to marriage and reproduction. The student of the family might be interested from the standpoint of type of environment afforded to the children. The eugenist might be interested from the standpoint of population quality on the assumption that there might be at least some genetic basis of personality. However, neither the Indianapolis Study nor the Princeton Study was able to uncover much relation of personality types to number of offspring. Measurements of personality for application in field surveys appear to be far from satisfactory.
MIGRATION
The subject of selective migration, particularly from rural to urban areas, is of common interest to demographers and geneticists. There is, for instance, a rich body of literature on the relation of mental illness to migration.
During the depression decade of the "thirties" there was much concern about rural areas as nursery beds of our national population. Fertility rates tended to be highest in areas where schools were poorest, where facilities for child health were poorest, and where levels of living were in general lowest. The resulting problems were regarded as national in scope in that there was continu-

ous migration from these rural areas to cities near and far.
Questions were raised as to selectivity of the migration by level of intelligence. Otto Klineberg's study of Negro migration found no indication that this migration was selective of I.Q. among Negro school children. He did find that length of residence in New York City was positively associated with I.Q. among migrant Negro children (Lorimer and Osborn, 1934).
In her Research Memorandum on Migration Differentials, Dorothy S. Thomas reported:
"When the situational and temporal factors are adequately controlled, migration may, under given circumstances, select the intelligent; under other circumstances, the less intelligent; and under still other circumstances, be quite unselective with regard to intelligence. But . . . definitive research must wait until the measuring instrument is better developed and the diagnosis of degrees of intelligence on a more certain basis." (Thomas, 1938.)
MORTALITY
Although the genetic significance of differentials in mortality may not be so important as that of differentials in fertility within modern societies, much research of common interest to geneticists and demographers is being done in the field of mortality. Recent or current studies include those of lethal mutations, neonatal death rate and birth weight in relation to environmental radiation, geology, and altitude, and studies of race and blood group diseases. The great declines in mortality in the underdeveloped areas of the world since the last

war have provided opportunities for studies of selective mortality and genetic implications.
THE INTERRELATION OF DEMOGRAPHY
AND POPULATION GENETICS
The two disciplines have in common a concern with people. According to Sutter, demography can contribute to population genetics in several ways. The provision of a demographic frame of reference with special emphasis on agegroup analysis might facilitate systematic progress in population genetics. The demographic frame of reference might also stimulate medical genetics to proceed from hospital data to census analysis. More use of demographic methods might be helpful in blood group analysis and in the study of mutation, esogenes, and consanguinity. Demography is in position also to provide a bond among the diverse efforts in genetics. In short, the demographic approach is the ecological approach in population genetics (Sutter, 1958).
On the other hand, population genetics has much to offer demography. The works of the masters in population genetics provide good examples of scientific rigor. An understanding of even the elementary principles of population genetics will help the demographer. It will give him better perspective on the questions of population characteristics and population quality.
The term "population quality" has different shades of meaning for the geneticist, the eugenist, the public health worker, the educator, the psychiatrist, the social worker, the student of law, and the businessman. In his recent article in the International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences,Dr. Gordon Allen states, "Eugenics is concerned with any qualities that parents confer on their

children because genetic and cultural traits are often correlated." In this connection Frederick Osborn has said, "We do nothave to know for the purposes of developing aneugenics program, the extent to which differences in I.Q.or achievement or personal characteristics are due to heredity or environment, so long asheredity has some part in these differences. The eugenist can beworking for social conditions which will make for more children among those with higher achievement scores" (communication, July 6,1964).
