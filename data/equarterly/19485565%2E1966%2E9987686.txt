Human beings, like members of other species, are clustered into breeding groups. As a consequence the distribution of variation in the human species is clustered rather than randomly distributed. The basic groups, or breeding populations, are characterized in large part by the habit of mating within the populations in preference to mating outside the populations. If random breeding obtained for the entire species, that is, if any one person has an equal probability of mating with any other person in the world, there would, of course, be no groups. All groups within the human species are capable of exchanging genes. Mariners, missionaries, salesmen, and soldiers, as well as other migratory persons, have demonstrated the essential interfertility of all groups within our species, even those quite distantly removed from each other. Arctic Eskimos and African Negroes, Australian aborigines and Englishmen, American Indians and Frenchmen are known by their progeny to be mutually interfertile. Some mating always takes place between contiguous groups, even though discouraged by custom or law. Thus, taken altogether, the evidence for interbreeding between both remote and contiguous groups clearly proves that all humans constitute one single species. Further, there is no evidence that any humans can interbreed with members of any other species, and this is reflected in the decided morphological gap between our species and all others. The common ancestry we share with the anthropoid apes

is so remote that interbreeding is quite impossible and also no single group or division of the human species is tangibly closer to the anthropoid apes than others. The differences between groups reflect an old and successful system of evolution which has enabled our species to proliferate over the entire world without separating into new species.
POPULATION SYSTEMS
The constituent populations of our species are of many dimensions, of different magnitudes, of varying antiquity and inclusiveness. There are five major continental divisions between whom there are substantial differences. However, the populations contained within each of these continental divisions differ greatly from each other. Blumenbach (1865) cited the five major divisions and these have been followed with minor innovations by researchers who have characterized the entire species (Boyd, 1950; Mourant, 1954; McArthur and Penrose, 1950; Howells, 1959; Coon, 1963). The five continental divisions are the Europeans, Negroes, Mongoloids, American Indians, and Oceanic peoples. Within the European (Caucasoid or White) division the constituent populations such as Basques, Lapps, Icelanders, and Hindus differ so much from each other that the same growth standards or frequencies of blood groups would not fit all of them. These differences are commensurate with the fact that these groups have had little contact with each other for many centuries, for both geo-

graphical and cultural reasons. These populations in turn are composed of constituent groups that differ from each other. Reindeer Lapps and Coastal Lapps are different breeding isolates. Similarly, there are many Basque groups and they differ from each other, though not as much as Basques as a whole differ from Lapps as a whole. The smaller divisions are often termed breeding isolates, local races, or demes. The term race has been used for several levels of groups, from the smallest isolate or Mendelian population up through the continental divisions, and occasionally it has been used for the species as a whole. So far as zoological nomenclature is concerned races are subdivisions of species. However, there is no lower limit and without further specification the term race simply indicates a biologically perpetuating subdivision of the species.
DEFINITIONS OF RACE
Though many definitions of race are technically accurate, no one is sufficiently complete to adequately express all the component aspects without extensive explication. Boyd (1950) and many others have defined a race as a breeding population, or intrabreeding unit, which differs from all others in the frequency of one or more genes. Intrabreeding, not to be confused with inbreeding, calls attention to the fact that mate exchange commonly takes place within the population. All individuals within a breeding population are necessarily related to each other. The stipulation that a population differs from others in the frequency of one or more genes is unnecessary and somewhat extraneous. No two breeding populations are ever identical. Further, it is theoretically possible that two separate races might be identical in the frequencies of the genes for which they are

studied yet differ in the network of genetic pathways underlying the frequencies. The habit of choosing mates within the group is the important behavior that defines a group. The physical characteristics are a consequence of the reproductive behavior. There is no gene for a group and no compelling external or internal force that holds it together.
A workable and economical definition is simply that races are groups between which restricted gene flow; has taken place. This kind of definition is essentially the same as the first, focussing instead on the inhibitions to gene flow between groups. It has the value of indicating the continuity that exists between all groups within the species. It has only the drawback that it is nonpontifical and obvious.
If a stipulation such as "uniqueness," "distinctiveness," or magnitude of difference is included in a definition then the basic genetical fact of an interbreeding community is subjugated in favor of an historical fact. The longer two groups are isolated from each other the more they will differ. It is desirable to cope with the origins of differences, to intercept them at the moment a breeding community is established, as well as centuries later when sufficient differences have accumulated to draw the attention of even casual observers.
In order to call attention to certain aspects of races that are commonly overlooked, though perfectly well implied, I think the following definition also has utility as well as accuracy: A race is a cluster of genetic pathways whose intersections recombine molecular units of inheritance some of which develop into living organisms that reproduce. Too much attention has traditionally been given to the end products of the repro-

ductive system, the traits of adult males and females most commonly used for morphological and serological sampling. At the same time the importance of the genealogical connections has been neglected. The genetic pathways, though invisible, are genuinely tangible in the sense that they can be assigned probability values and manipulated in a variety of ways. The degrees of relationship between individuals in a population can be computed, and it is necessary for individuals to be genetically related in order to be genetic members of a breeding population. The network of genetic pathways extends backward in time and outward between groups and therewith constituting one of the real reasons for considering a population as a process.
Molecular materials are transmitted from parents to offspring, not traits. The final expression of a trait represents many biochemical steps and many complex interrelations. Recombination of genetic materials is crucial. Most variation is the result of recombination and enough variability exists to provide for future evolution without new or recurrent mutations (Crow, 1961, pp. 426427). The living individuals of any race can express only a small fraction of the total variability which they carry. By the same token, any large population, Bushmen, Basques, Lapps, or Icelanders, contains sufficient variability to recreate, with recombination and selection, the total range of variation for the entire species (Ginsburg and Laughlin, 1966).
The important fact is that races are populations, not individuals or types, and that there is a system of populations comprising the species. The population structures of species must be understood if the variation within the species is to be interpreted from a genetic, ecological,

and evolutionary point of view (Mayr, 1963, p. 360, see Chapter 13, The Population Structure of Species; see also Grant, 1963, Chapter 12, Population Systems).
Races are populations and the cryptic variation carried in the population exceeds by several magnitudes the phenotypic or apparent variation which can be detected directly by caliper measurements, biochemical tests, or photographs. The anatomical and physiological characteristics of a race accessible to direct investigation are only a small part of the total variability available to succeeding generations of the same population. Measurement of the living adults and children is only a sample even though every living man, woman, and child is studied.
The crucial importance of the concept of population and of population thinking becomes obvious when it is appreciated that evolution takes place only in populations, not in individuals and not in higher systematic categories. Natural selection, the process which determines which individuals have a greater or lesser proportion of offspring that survive to reproduce in turn, operates only in populations. Basic genetic changes which take place in the individual, do not affect him. Rather, they can only be registered in the contribution he makes to his offspring. This has been most economically epitomized by G. G. Simpson (1964, p. 1535), "Changes in individual expression--to put it figuratively, the way the message is read-- do not affect the message itself. The necessary message--constructing feedback--is not here but in a system of higher order: in the population and not the individual. It operates through natural selection, which operates in populations, just as populations are what really evolve."

DEFINING POPULATIONS
Populations are processes, not states, in a very real sense. Any one study will sample the population at a particular point in time. The population is of course changing at the moment that it is being studied. Births and deaths and age changes in the living members continue without remission. This is microevolutionary change, but it contains the same processes that result in macroevolutionary change which is simply long term evolution. Again, it is important to reiterate the basic fact that evolution only takes place in populations. Higher taxonomic categories and long term trends are the result of the action inside particular populations. If child growth is a research objective then the same individuals must be measured at intervals. Likewise, if secular changes are the major concern, then succeeding generations of the same population must be sampled.
Whether the populations studied are Lapps, Eskimos, Bushmen, Basques, Hutterites, or the people of Ann Arbor, Michigan, any individual from whom a specimen is taken or upon whom a measurement is made must be identified as a genetic member of the population, not a casual visitor. Thus, the first step consists of collecting genealogies and of verifying them. Any person who has given or received genetic material can be defined into the population to which his parents belong or to the two populations to which they individually belong if he is a hybrid offspring. The actual collection of genealogies can be done fairly quickly in a small isolate if it is confined to the individuals examined, but the collection of a full genealogy of even a small isolate is an extensive undertaking, especially if demographic data including age, birth

order, and other variables are included. Various methods are available for the genetic analysis of metropolitan populations (Spuhler and Clark, 1961).
In short, a breeding group is defined as a group in which there is an actual exchange of genetic materials between individuals who thereby set up a cluster of related persons. In this sense, the cluster or race defines itself. The products of various unions result in individuals, some of whom live to reproductive age or beyond and who thus may return some genetic material to the population. In a small isolate everyone is related to each other, however, the relationship may be so remote that it cannot be traced by geneological methods, and other methods must be employed to establish relationships between groups. Within a single breeding community there may be persons unrelated to those living there, and there will be a number who have one parent or grandparent from another group. Such persons have membership in more than one group and constitute a valuable group for studies of gene flow, the actual transmission of genetic material from one group to another.
Physical appearance or possession of particular genetic traits is not the basis for membership in a particular isolate or population, it is a consequence of such membership. Depending upon circumstances it may provide an excellent clue. If the investigator approaches the group with a preconceived notion of what the typical Eskimo or Basque looks like and an equally preconceived notion of how much an individual can depart from his ideal of a typical Eskimo, he may then reject individuals for the sample that do in fact have genetic membership. He will usually shorten the actual range of variation that exists in most human groups. Visual identification is not reli-

able until after the group has been characterized and then it may be of no use unless supported by machine analysis. People in contiguous groups tend to look like each other.
CHARACTERIZATION AND IDENTIFICATION
DISTINGUISHED
The characterization or description of a group is a different process from the identification of single individuals. In forensic cases, or medicolegal cases a person (or skeleton) may be identified as that of a particular race, sex, and age. The ability to discriminate or identify an individual depends upon the degree of differentiation of the group to which it belongs. Identification, assignment, discrimination, or pigeonholing of individuals must follow after the pigeonholes have been constructed. In brief, identification refers to the assignment of individuals to groups, characterization refers to the description of the variation within a group, and classification refers to the arrangement of groups. Individuals cannot be classified, only population units can be classified.
CHARACTERIZING A POPULATION
Any traits can be used to characterize a population and their selection depends upon the aims of the study. In general, populations differ in their genetic structure, (the degrees of relationship between the members, the members, the amount of inbreeding, etc.), in various demographic features (ratio of males to females, infant mortality, number of births per male or female, etc.), the genetic basis or mode of inheritance, and in the presence or absence and frequencies of various traits or characters. Any trait that varies between individuals within a population also varies between popula-

tions, though the interpopulation variation may be slight. Body size and proportions (stature, weight, relative length of trunk to legs), pigmentation of the hair, skin and eyes, hair form and distribution on the body, numbers of vertebrae, fingerprints, bone density, basal metabolic rate, sweating, fissural patterns on the chewing surfaces of the teeth, and blood groups are among those most commonly studied. Various chronic diseases, such as dislocated hips or imperfections of the spinal column are important traits whose epidemiology is being placed on a firm population basis (Neel, Shaw, and Schull, 1963). Diseases are extremely important because of their selective action and the fact that new methods are being developed for detection of the various host factors including inherited susceptibility to disease (Blumberg, 1961; Osborne, 1961).
The characterization of a group then consists of finding the distribution of variation within the group. This is accomplished by statistical methods, the construction of arithmetic means, and measures of dispersion for continuously varying traits such as stature or head size. For traits with discontinuous distribution, that is, where some individuals do and others do not display the trait in question, such as blood type B or Rhesus negative, percentages or proportions are used to describe their frequency.
Traits used in characterizing a population must have an appreciable element of heritability. However, they need not be under simple genetic control nor free of direct external modification. Many traits such as stature or weight are modified by external events in the life of the individual, notably nutrition and, in the case of weight, by work habits. Such traits have several pairs

Race

o£ genes involved in their inheritance in addition to many developmental factors leading to their expression at the time they are measured. Other traits, such as blood groups, have little or no modification with age, sex, diet, or habits. Nevertheless, their frequencies within a group may be seriously modified by the customary breeding habits of the people, by intrinsic factors such as incompatibilities between antigens and antibodies, and by the amount of mixture bringing different frequencies into the group. The adaptive value of most traits is not known and it is unsafe to assume that traits relatively unaffected by direct environmental modification are more stable or neutral in evolution.
Some behavioral traits have a simple mode of inheritance (relatively few biochemical steps between the gene and its expression), but most are obviously complex interactions depending upon sequence and timing in the socialization of the individual. A syndrome, such as Mongolism (Down's syndrome), depends upon one additional chromosome where there should be only two, but there are important variations in frequency related to the age of the mother. Behavioral genetics has been a neglected field and little is known about, the genetic factors for such traits as genius or intelligence generally. Twin studies prove a high component of heritability, but the mode of inheritance is not known. The difficulties of estimating genius in different cultures are presently insurmountable. Any discussion of traits, however, would be remiss in failing to carefully underline the fact that total behavior, and not just locomotor behavior, is crucial in the evolution of the human species (Mayr, 1963; Ginsburg, 1958).

BOUNDARY-MAINTAINING DEVICES
In the early history of man geographic separation was a more important factor than it has been since the major increase in population, which began with the spread of neolithic food-producing economies some five thousand years B.C. Sinanthropus pekinensis, the middle-Pleistocene fossil man of northern China, likely had no great problem in keeping out foreigners, for the nearest foreigners were too few and too distanct to constitute a major threat to the integrity of his community. With increasing impingements between neighboring communities, attendant upon increase in population size and multiplication of groups, exclusion became a more obvious problem. A large share of the efforts of human groups goes into maintaining differentiation from other groups. A major function of culture is the maintenance of the integrity of groups, the mutual welfare of their members, whether tribal units or larger national groupings. The various kinship and mating rules common to all groups operate to obligate matings between members of groups and to minimize matings with nonmembers. Many other ' aspects of culture have important bearings on breeding behavior and thus many genetic consequences. The various mechanisms that are deliberately employed to maintain group boundaries, and the various practices that also serve this same function indirectly, are difficult to classify singly because of their complex interrelationships and because many are simply byproducts of internal social organization.
The most concrete and obvious devices for discouraging gene exchange are walls. The Great Wall of China, Hadrian's Wall in England, and the Pale

which formerly surrounded Dublin are megaparietal versions of ghetto walls. Immigration barriers incorporated into law are equally effective though lacking in architectural magnificence. Whether membership is based upon kinship, or upon political citizenship, the distinction between members and nonmembers is always effectively made. Each cultural system limits participation in the culture to a well-recognized group by means of various techniques and ideologies. These include the preservation of territorial rights mentioned above, initiation rites, cleansing ceremonies, secret activities, privileged information, inheritance rights, and encouragement of self-defining concepts of ethnocentrism and religious beliefs which obligate marriage among the adherents of the religion. Linguistic communities, whether dialectical (mutually intelligible but distinctive) or of higher magnitude such as a language, are highly important in defining breeding communities and often denote relatively sharp lines of demarcation. Races such as Basques, Lapps, and Eskimos are neatly defined by their distinctive languages. Within each there are subdivisions which cohere with dialectical distinctions. Few outsiders ever learn to speak Basque or Eskimo, though members of these groups learn other languages quite easily. It is even rumored that children of these groups are born a year earlier than children of other linguistic stocks because of the additional time needed to learn their languages. Though there well may be no truth in this the general fact is that languages maximize intercourse among their speakers and inhibit intercourse between speakers of other languages. The generalization can be put in two forms, that people who marry each other tend to speak the same language, or that people who speak the same language tend

to marry each other. It should be stressed that language and cultural ideas are not inherited genetically though learning ability is heritable to an important degree. Any human child can learn any language. The association between race and language, remarkably congruent in certain groups, is an indirect or historical association. As noted by Kroeber, "Speech tends to be one of the most persistent population characters; and "ethnic" boundaries are most often speech boundaries" (Kroeber, 1948, p. 221).
Mating rules are important to the internal structure of a culture as well as to its external boundaries and have much evolutionary significance as a consequence. The actual matings are of course more important than the rules for mating which often are ignored. The lack of conformity between actual behavior and ideal behavior in this respect is notable (Kunstadter et al., 1963).
The most notable effect of mating rules is connected with inbreeding. All populations tend to be endogamous, to select their mates within the group, though they may be subdivided into exogamous divisions that depend upon other subdivisions for their mates. Endogamous groups often, but not always, encourage mating between close relatives, which is inbreeding.
Major physiographic features are always important in regulating contact between groups, even though they are not impenetrable. Deserts, oceans, and mountains can be crossed, but not as easily as crossing a street or visiting another village within the same community. Mountain ranges, fjords, glaciers, and various transitional zones between ecological areas are enormously important in understanding the distribution of people and the frequency of contacts between them. In each case the barriers

are culturally interpreted. Use of the camel enables people to tranverse deserts otherwise impassable, and use of boats may redefine a body of water into a well-traveled highway rather than a barrier, and the use of dogs and sleds among Arctic peoples, or the horse among Plains Indians vastly increased the range of their movements and the frequency of interaction between population units.
Caste differences may be fully as great as differences between geographically separate groups (Sanghvi, 1953). They illustrate quite uniquely the efficacy of cultural barriers to random mating between groups. Similarly, groups that are denned primarily on the basis of religion can become physically as distinctive as groups that are ecologically separated (Sachs and Bat-Miriam, 1957). Obviously several boundary maintaining devices operate in conjunction with each other though some factors may appear to be more prominent than others.
Other factors which serve as diffusion barriers consist of such things as the relative difference in population size between two contiguous groups. Large corporate units cannot be hybridized by smaller population units, but rather the large units dissipate or absorb smaller numbers of immigrants without leaving a trace in many cases. This has been important in the history of Japan (Suzuki, 1958). Still another category is that of population buffering by means of intervening populations. The effects of gene flow are diluted with each successive population unit that the genes are passed through, in the absence of maximizing agents such as a selective advantage.
In summary one might note that the great diversity within the human species is evidence that there are many effective boundary maintaining devices.

INTERGRADATION BETWEEN SUBSPECIES
DIVISION
Since all races can exchange genes, and all do when the opportunity arises, there is much intergradation or overlap in the physical characteristics, though this is only one of several reasons. The taller American Indians such as Mohave have some members who are of the same stature as the much shorter Pueblo Indians. The overlap in measurements of size and form is common even for groups widely separated. This is not true for pigmentation and hair form. Widely separated groups may be sharply differentiated. The hair of all Eskimos is straight, and the head hair of all Bushmen is spirally tufted or kinky. No Northern Europeans are as heavily pigmented as Equatorial Negroes. Among serological traits there are a number of antigens that are absent in some groups and present in others. Many South American Indians are completely lacking in the antigens for blood groups A and B. The blood group Diego is common in South American Indians and completely absent in Europeans. More often the different races differ only in the frequency of genes for various blood groups, especially contiguous races, but this is by no means true for all the blood group genes. Combinations or patterns of traits vary so that contiguous groups, such as Japanese and Ainu, differ sharply from each other. American Indians are sharply differentiated from Mongoloids, such as the Aleuts and Eskimos, and Lapps are easily distinguished individually as well as corporately from surrounding Norwegians, Swedes, Finns, and Russians.
Two generalizations can be made that provide a general guide to appreciating the distribution of variation in relation to populations. Groups far removed

334

Laughlin

from each other are most dissimilar and share the least affinity with each other. Similarity and affinity are closely related but not identical in all contexts. The second generalization is that intergradation in physical characteristics, or the absence of sharp lines, does not remove or nullify the existence of the populations. The fact that two groups are similar to each other does not mean that there is only one group instead of two. No two populations are ever identical, any more than two individuals are identical.
Mixture is one of the most important processes contributing to similarity between races. However, there are many other processes at work, some of which produce different results under different conditions. All races cannot mix with all other races in equal proportions. Differential degrees of mixture produce different results. Some groups live in areas where environmental stresses are more rigorous. There is for example no way that high altitude dwellers such as Andean Indians could escape the oxygen tension stresses of high altitude. Depending upon its history a particular race may have retained a greater proportion of genes from an earlier period. Differences in population size affect a number of evolutionary agencies and consequently abstract rates of change cannot be established. Intergradation between populations does not pose insurmountable problems in classification, if the populations have been established on a genetical basis.
METHODS OF COMPARING GROUPS
The fact that different kinds of people live in different places has been known for several centuries. This fact, plus a knowledge of the genetics of variation does not automatically produce an understanding of the processes and patterns

of human evolution, neither in general terms nor in the elucidation of the history of particular races. Comparisons between contemporaneous groups, and between successive groups in time, are essential components in the meaningful interpretation of both the processes and the trends in human evolution. There are many ways of comparing populations of which formal classifications are only one. The construction of a species standard within which each population can be compared is an efficient method of comparison; construction of clines or character gradients is still another useful method; and classification involving the estimation of biological distance (numerical taxonomy) between three or more groups constitutes a third major category of methods for handling variation between groups. It must be emphasized frequently that the quantification or description of degrees of similarity between races does not in itself explain how these came about. Differences and similarities must be described in objective and biologically meaningful ways. Such comparisons are an indispensable step to explaining the variations, but do not in themselves automatically provide an explanation.
Recognizing the unity of the human species, that no division has approached the boundary of speciation, and the corollary fact that no one division can serve as a norm for other divisions, it is interesting to know what the average value is for various measurements for the entire species. Thus, the average man is 165 cm tall, ranging from 121 cm to 199 cm as physiologically normal limits. Any particular population can be rated according to its divergence from such species standard values. The same standard frequencies have been computed for the major blood groups and provide an equally useful overview of

Vol. 13, No. 4

Race

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:29 08 December 2015

the entire species and population divergence within it. The remarks of Penrose are relevant,
Everyone is accustomed, quite erroneously, to regard the group from which he has originated as being the normal. Judged by world standards, his group is likely to be abnormal and he may have to fall back on the assumption that, though unusual, it may represent a specially desirable set of gene frequencies. He is perhaps justified only in inferring that his group has a genetical structure well suited in the past to its environment, else it would not have maintained itself (Penrose, 1951, p. 397).
CLINAL COMPARISONS
Where a character varies over distance, from one geographical region to another, it is possible to trace the frequency of the character, for example, the frequency of blood group B, or the average value for a continuous trait such as stature or weight in each population unit of the region or areas under examination. The term "cline" or "gradient" refers to a single character that is being traced over distance, not to populations. A single population may participate in as many clines as it has characters which are found in other populations. A commonly cited examples of a blood group cline is seen in the increase of blood group B proceeding from Western Europe into Central Asia. Geographical variation in stature and weight, in pigmentation, and in many other characters has been plotted for the world and a number of rules have been formulated to describe this variation. According to Bergman's rule the smaller sized geographical races within a species are found in the warmer parts of its continental distribution, and the larger races in the cooler parts. Within the New World, for example, Central American Indians such as the Maya are small

whereas North American Indians tend to be larger with increase in latitude.
Use of the term "cline" and the study of gradation in measurable characters were originally proposed as an auxiliary taxonomic method to correct defects inherent in naming areal groups, in order to stress "continuity and regularity of variation as against mere distinctness of groups" (Huxley, 1938, p. 219). Clines are generally considered to be the joint product of two opposing forces, selection and mixture. Selection tends to enhance the adaptation of a population to its local environment whereas gene flow or mixture tends to enhance similarities between populations. The explanation of clinal variation has tended to utilize correlations between characters and environment especially climate, nutrition, and disease, as evidence of adaptations, rather than as the beginning point for research to elucidate the relative contribution of the various factors that produce a trend in variation. Plausibility is often substituted for proof.
CLASSIFICATION
One way of comparing different populations is that of computing the relative degrees of similarity between three or more. The basic assumption underlying such comparisons is that similarity is a measure of relationship or affinity. It must be reiterated that formal classifications constitute only one aspect of the study of population units within the species. It is one method of studying the distribution of variation within the species and of following variation backward in time, of studying long term evolution, including the origins and affinities of various divisions. Formal classifications provide an objectivity that is seriously needed to correct many ancient and honored misconceptions concerning relationships of populations. The pecu-

336

liar notions that Melanesians were significantly more similar and tangibly related to African Negroes, rather than to other Oceanic peoples, or that the Lapps were more similar to and therefore more closely related to Mongoloids rather than to other Europeans, are specimens of fallacious conclusions based upon causal inspection of physical data and preconceptions which are not supported when multivariate distance statistics or similar methods are employed.
Classification consists of the arrangement of groups. The term "relational systematics" (Ginsburg and Laughlin, 1966) may be useful to emphasize the relational or arrangement nature of such operations. It is frequently confused with the enumeration or inventory of groups. The problem of arrangement remains, whether we choose to classify 10,000 small demes or five continental divisions. At the simplest level we may compare any three groups such as Icelanders, Southern Norwegians, and South African Bushmen. No single Bushman could be visually mistaken for either an Icelander or a Norwegian, and the formal examination of serological data, pigmentation, body measurements, hair form, and whatever other traits we wish to use will illustrate the fact that the two northern groups are more similar to each other than either is to the Bushman. We infer various things from this triangular comparison, one inference being that the Bushmen have been separated from the Scandinavians for a longer period of time than the two Scandinavian populations have been separated from each other. If we should take three neighborhoods or three village isolates on the island of Iceland we should have the same basic methodological problem, and if we chose to classify three genera, such as Paranthropus, Australopithecus, and Oreopithecus,

we would still have the same basic problem in arrangement.
It is sometimes remarked that one of the problems facing the taxonomist is that there are no clear cut distinctions, no sharp lines, between populations. It is trivially obvious that populations within a species are not separated by sharp lines. This has been carefully noted from the time of Blumenbach (1795) through Darwin (Descent of Man, 1871) to the present. It is a consequence or a reflection of the fact that we are examining variation within a single species. The fact that two populations are extremely similar does not mean that there is only one population instead of two, if they have been genetically defined. A group that has recently fissioned from another group will obviously be quite similar to its parent population. It is, nevertheless, a distinguishable population if it constitutes a group in which the members habitually select most of their mates. Such small or newly formed groups are especially valuable for the study of the processes of population formation.
Conversely, if we choose to work with groups of higher taxonomic status, such as the three genera cited above, our problems in estimating relative degrees of similarity and of inferring affinity or phylogenetic relatedness remain as intransigent as before. No single skull of Oreopithecus, a Pliocene hominid, of Paranthropus, a lower Pleistocene Australopithecine, or of Australopithecus, a lower Pleistocene ancestor of man, could be mistaken for each other even by visual sorting. The absence of intergradation does not ameliorate or remove the problem of estimating their relationships. Paleontologists who are working with larger taxonomic groupings such as genera, or families, have quite as many troubles and literary alterca-

tions as anthropologists working inside our single species.
The labor involved in numerical classifications may be considerable (Rao, 1952; Sokal and Sneath, 1963; Spuhler, 1954; Campbell, 1963) and as with the construction of clines, or the comparison of populations with the species as a whole, the interpretation of the differences and similarities, the explanations are not automatically provided.
The purpose or purposes which provide the basis for a study provide the level of abstraction at which the researcher will operate. Thus, if we are interested in the effects of inbreeding and nutrition we shall find it necessary to study small groups such as immigrants from a Swiss valley who have moved to California. If we want to investigate the history of a stock that has congruence between linguistic, ecological, and genetical features such as the Eskimo, then we will compare all the village groups of Eskimos for which we can secure data. If we want to summarize for the world as a whole we may then resort to comparisons between the major continental areas. Our choice of population units is analogous to the contour interval used by surveyors and cartographers. A map of the world cannot show all the smaller variations that a soil map of a single country must show. Intervals of five or ten feet may be used for greater detail of small areas, and intervals of 500 or 1,000 feet for large continental areas. The comparisons we choose to make do not affect the existence of population units, they exist whether we choose to use them or not, whether we decide to give them formal taxonomic names or not.
Two examples may suffice here to illustrate the point that populations have a reality apart from the observer. At the lower level the Polar Eskimos,

numbering originally some 250, may be cited as a population unit which can be decomposed into local denies but are a geographically delimited isolate in the extreme. These people thought they were the only people in the world when they were discovered and indeed they had probably been completely isolated for some two hundred years or more, a rare phenomenon in humans. If all isolates of this magnitude were listed for the world the number would run into the tens of thousands, yet they do exist and for some purposes they must be dealt with.
On the other hand we need to go back in time only 15,000 years to rid ourselves of any question concerning New World populations, for there were none. It would be entirely appropriate to summarize the major divisions of variation in the world into only three, if we confined ourselves to the world o£ 15,000-30,000 years ago. We should then have only Asiatic Mongoloids, Europeans, and Africans south of the Sahara. Actually there would have been as much diversity between the population units within these broad categories as there is today. However, we would not have to wonder about the position of the Oceanic peoples of Australia, Melanesia, Polynesia, and Micronesia--they did not exist. Now, whether American Indians should be classified as a separate race from their parental populations of Asia depends primarily upon whether you wish to emphasize origins or emphasize processes and the actual existence of these separate populations. The New World aborigines have had a separate evolutionary history for at least 11,000 years. Whether they are as distinct from Asiatics, as say Africans are from Europeans, is a separate question.
Viewed from the standpoint of biological evolution and of culture history,

all human groups that have come into existence, for whatever reasons, are of value for studying the dynamics of race and culture, no matter how small they may actually be.
THE GENETIC UNITY OF THE SPECIES:
SUMMARY
The single human species is extremely diverse in many respects, and this diversity has been a major feature enabling the species to achieve its worldwide distribution and a high degree of control over nature and over the destiny of the species. This diversity, as well as the similarity, is seen in population units of various orders of magnitude ranging from small, local demes, breeds, neighborhoods, or local races through ever more inclusive groups, such as the continental divisions of mankind to the species as a whole. These population units, or races, have two points of critical significance for understanding man's place in nature. One point concerns the role they perform in the evolution of the species, and the other concerns how we apprehend the species, how we secure information about it. The first point may be epitomized for the moment with the observation that evolution only takes place in populations, not in individuals. The second point is based upon a sampling problem. We want to know and understand the evolution of the entire species. There is so much diversity that we cannot use one group as a standard for the species, neither is there any one race that can be omitted. The values for measurements of the body, for pigmentation, growth rates, or blood groups that are characteristic of any one population are not characteristic for other populations. We cannot predict from one population what other populations ought to be.
The next major idea concerns the uses

of information about populations and this rests again upon the fact that breeding populations are the transactional units in which evolution is taking place, and evolution includes a multitude of phenomena ranging from disease susceptibility to gene frequency ratios, from infant mortality to hair form and behavior. Some of the information has significance for estimating affinities between groups, for racial history and for rates of evolution. However, the study of human populations, used synonymously here for races, involves much more than estimating affinities between peoples and making classifications. The genetic, morphological, ecological, and behavioral dynamics of a human population extend in many directions. In fact, the more that is known about the mechanics of population genetics, about the etiology and developmental phenomena of various traits, the better the applications that can be made to particular problems, such as those concerned with origins and affinities of human groups. Child growth is an enormously important area of interest. Information on child growth in different populations contributes to the understanding of child growth in any one population and for the species as a whole. The genetic basis of many traits, as well as the frequencies of the traits, varies between different populations. Our understanding of what traits are, to what extent they are inherited, and the ways in which they are developed in their complex interactions with both the intrinsic and extrinsic environment can only be secured by population studies, ideally on all the populations of the world, and minimally on enough different populations to estimate the major parameters of the traits.
The most synoptic and grand problems can only be solved by studying particular characteristics of particular populations

at a particular time. An over all charter for studying the entire human species is provided by the challenging question of what factors provide the cohesion that binds the species together. This has been phrased as a general problem by Mayr in his remark, "The essential genetic unity of species cannot be doubted. Yet the mechanisms by which this unity is maintained are still largely unexplored" (Mayr, 1963, p. 523). We now know that there is but one human species, and we know a great deal about it, but we are only beginning to understand how the unity of our species has been maintained through thousands of years of adaptation to diverse areas encompassing the entire world.
The unity of the species does not rest exclusively upon admixture between races, though mixture is an important process that promotes similarity between those groups that mix by introducing the same traits into groups that did not previously have them and by equalizing their frequencies. Two other contributing categories to species unity are (1) common ancestors from which many traits held in common are retained, and (2) parallel evolution, the tendency of separate populations to evolve in the same direction owing to such things as a common starting point, the limit imposed upon possible new traits and recombinations based upon those already in hand, and similarities in selection pressures. Parallel evolution is a large and complex category which importantly includes variations in the basis of inheritance with similarity in the clinical or observational entities produced. There are alternate routes at the molecular, familial, and population level for adaptations which serve the same end. This has been an important trend in the primate order as a whole. The method of locomotion involving the use of the

arms for swinging (brachiation) has arisen separately in Asia among the orangs and gibbons, in Africa among the chimpanzees and gorillas, and in South America among spider monkeys, woolly monkeys, and woolly spider monkeys. Races can and do exchange genes because they are capable of gene exchange, and previous or earlier gene exchange is one of the factors that has rendered them capable of such exchange. However, all three of the broad categories of shared inheritance, parallel evolution, and mixture are responsible for the maintenance of similarities between races and thus for the continued unity of our species.
It should further be noted that highly isolated divisions of the species have successfully solved their problem of survival, of biological perpetuation of themselves, and of communication. The fallacious belief that race mixture is a prerequisite of progress may be true for some small groups who are genuinely inbred and who have a significantly high frequency of disabling diseases as a consequence. However, populations in general carry an enormous amount of concealed genetic variability. This is adequate for the maintenance of genetic variability for future evolution for several hundreds of generations. If a major source of genetic variability, mutation, was stopped completely, neither the species as a whole nor its larger population units would be aware of it for thousands of years, except for reduced frequencies of some diseases such as hemophilia and muscular dystrophy (Crow, 1961). The rise of complex civilizations among the Maya and Incas of Central and South America, with no outside influence from Europe or from Asia, in a continent discovered and occupied by primitive hunters only 15,000 years ago, illustrates the enormous creativity potential in different populations.
