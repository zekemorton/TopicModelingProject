INTRODUCTION
That human somatic cells contain only 46 chromosomes was discovered in 1956 (Tjio and Levan, 1956). This discovery was based on a few simple technical innovations: (1) the use of tissue culture to obtain a monolayer of dividing cells, (2) the use of colchicine to obtain larger numbers of dividing cells at metaphase, (3) hypotonic treatment of these cells prior to fixation, (4) flattening of the cells to spread the chromosomes in a single optical plane, and (5) photographic karyotype analysis.
Cells to be grown in culture can be obtained from bone marrow (Ford, et. al., 1958), solid tissues (Puck, et al., 1958; Harnden, 1960) or peripheral blood samples (Hungerford, et al., 1959). A standard system of nomenclature for the human chromosomes, the Denver classification, has been prepared by a group of workers in this field (Denver, 1960). The chromosomes are divided into seven groups; the chromosomes within some groups can be distinguished with difficulty or not at all.

Chromosomal abnormalities were first found in association with mongolism and Klinefelter's syndrome. Several mongols were shown to be trisomic for chromosome number 21 of the Denver Classification (Lejeune, et al., 1959); and a chromatin-positive man with Klinefelter's syndrome, found to have 47 chromosomes, had a probable XXY sex chromosome constitution (Jacobs and Strong, 1959). A man with both these syndromes had 48 chromosomes, with 21trisomy and XXY (Ford, et al, 1959a). A chromatin-negative woman with Turner's syndrome (gonadal dysgenesis) had only 45 chromosomes in each metaphase cell, with a probable XO sex chromosome complement (Ford, et al., 19596).
Many further chromosomal abnormalities have now been reported, involving chromosome number,, mosaicism, or gain, loss or interchange of chromosomal material, e.g., translocations. These findings will be reviewed in the succeeding sections of this paper, and some attempt made to show how these abnormalities may have come about. We have recently prepared a fuller review of the methods and some of the results and theoretical interpretations in this field (Hirschhorn and Cooper, 1961a).
AUTOSOMAL ABNORMALITIES
Trisomy. In addition to mongolism, two well-defined syndromes associated with specific autosomal trisomy have

been described. Edwards et al. (1960) reported the first, a child with 47 chromosomes and the following clinical features: small triangular mouth, lowset slanting ears, flat and broad nasal bridge, webbed neck, hyperflexibility, webbing between the second and third toes, cyanotic congenital heart disease, a shield-like chest with lateral nipples, and characteristically clenched fists. Since the first description, at least eleven cases have been found (Edwards, 1961; Smith, et al., 1960; Hirschhorn and Cooper, 1961 b). Edwards describes the chromosome appearing in triplicate as chromosome number 17, while Patau prefers to call it chromosome number 18. We cannot make a decision one way or another, and prefer to call this a trisomy for a chromosome of the group 17-18.
Patau et al. (1960) reported another syndrome in two children with 47 chromosomes and the following clinical features: cerebral defect, anophthalmia (microphthalmia has also been found), cleft palate and harelip, simian lines, "trigger" thumbs, polydactyly, capillary hemangiomata, and congenital heart disease. Several of these cases have now been found. The triplicated chromosome in this case is one in the group 13-15.
There have been several other reports of trisomy in single individuals. Hayward and Bower (1960) have found three chromosomes (number 22) in one case with the Sturge-Weber Syndrome, but this has not been confirmed. Fraccaro et al. (1960c) reported trisomy of chromosome number 19 in a supposedly normal man, whose mongol child also was said to have three number 19 chromosomes but only one chromosome number 21. Book and Santesson (1960a) reported a mother and son whose only apparent pathology was an inter-atrial septal defect. Both individuals were tri-

somic for a chromosome in the group 19-20, while the son was also monosomic for one of the chromosomes of group 21-22. Book et al. (1961) also described a woman with familial inter-atrial septal defect and chromosomal mosaicism. Some of her cells had 46 chromosomes and others 47 chromosomes. The latter were trisomic for one of the chromosomes in group 6-12. This woman's daughter is clinically normal, has 46 chromosomes and demonstrates a translocation between a chromosome number 2 and a chromosome in group 6-12. Other reports of translocations and mosaicism will be discussed below. Book and Santesson (19606) also reported a case of multiple malformations in a man whose skin cells had 69 chromosomes, of a triploid number, with each autosome present in triplicate and a sex chromosome constitution of XXY. His bone marrow cells, however, were normally diploid.
The occurrence of mongolism and Klinefelter's syndrome in the same individuals has been described in two cases (Harnden, et al., 1960; Lanman, et al, 1960). Each of the individuals had 48 chromosomes, with the expected trisomy of chromosome number 21 and a sex chromosome constitution of XXY. It is not known whether this represents coincidence or the presence of factors predisposing the gametocytes of one parent to an increased frequency of nondisjunction.
Translocations. Turpin et al. (1959) first described an individual having 45 chromosomes, probably as the result of a reciprocal translocation. The individual was missing one each of chromosomes number 13 and 21, but had an extra chromosome apparently made up of the long arms of these two chromosomes, joined together at the

centromere. The authors attribute the patient's clinical syndrome, which they call polydysspondylism, to the loss of the genetic material on the short arms of the translocated chromosomes. In view of the apparently sizable number of normal individuals with similar translocations (see below), the possibility of coincidence must be considered. Lejeune et al. (1960) have reported a case of Klinefelter's syndrome with 46 chromosomes, one of which consisted of the reciprocally translocated long arms of two chromosomes in the 13-15 group joined at the centromere.
The most common translocations have been reported in certain mongols with 46 chromosomes and, in some cases, in their asymptomatic relatives, who had 45 chromosomes. The first case was described by Polani et al. (1960), who found a mongol girl with 46 chromosomes. Five of the chromosomes were group 13-15, two were number 21 chromosomes, two were number 22 chromosomes and there was an extra chromosome, representing the translocated long arms of the third chromosome number 21 expected for mongolism and the missing chromosome from group 13-15. Several similar cases have been reported, including chromosome analyses of the families (Penrose, et al, 1960; Carter, et al, I960; Breg and Miller, 1961). In the first of these reports, the sister, mother and maternal grandmother were all normal but had 45 chromosomes, with the same translocation product as the male and female mongol sibs with
46 chromosomes. The family reported by Carter et al. was similar, and also included several mongols.
Breg and Miller (1961) have described the only normal male with 45 chromosomes and the typical translocation chromosome. His wife's two preg-

nancies terminated prematurely, the infants dying after a few hours. Stillbirths and deaths in early infancy, as well as mongolism, appear to have an increased incidence in the pregnancies of females with this translocation. Since the abnormal meiotic pairing of chromosomes in a person who is heterozygous for the 15-21 translocated chromosome probably leads to an increased incidence of triplo-
21 mongols, it seems likely that triplo15 individuals may also be produced, and may be represented in the group of stillborn infants.
Translocations can best be recognized by demonstrating typical translocation figuresin meiotic chromosomes, but only one report of such a study has appeared (Miller, et al, 1960). Testicular biopsies of four mongols were examined. In two of these biopsies, abnormalities suggestive of translocation figures were seen. Mitotic chromosome analysis of one of these two individuals showed the presence of 46 chromosomes (plus a minute fragment) and a probable 21-22 translocation (Penrose, et al, 1960).
Hirschhorn and Cooper (19616) have recently found this type of translocation with the long arms of a chromosome number 21 and a chromosome number 22 joined in mitotic metaphase cells from blood and skin cultures of a mongol boy with acute monocytoid leukemia. Both parents and all siblings were normal, with 46 chromosomes. Buckton et al (1961) have also reported a case of acute lymphatic leukemia in a non-mongol sibling of a mongol with a 15-21 translocation; their normal mother had 45 chromosomes and the 15-21 translocation. It will be of interest to observe whether the high incidence of leukemia in mongols may be related to the presence of a translocation.

ABNORMALITIES INVOLVING THE SEX
CHROMOSOME
Most of the known chromosomal abnormalities in man involve the sex chromosomes. There are three main classes, which have their characteristic causes: (1) abnormalities of chromosome number, due to meiotic nondisjunction; (2) chromosomal mosaicism, due to somatic nondisjunction or to chromosome loss in a fraction of the cells; and (3) interchange, gain or loss of chromosomal material, due to other causes.
Abnormalities of number. Turner's syndrome and Klinefelter's syndrome were the first conditions in which sex chromosome abnormalities were found (XO and XXY, respectively). The occurrence of XO and XXY individuals can be explained on the basis of primary nondisjunction in the ovary of the mother. If this occurred at the first meiotic division, O- or XX- containing ova would be produced. When fertilized by X- or Y- bearing sperm, these would give rise to XO, YO, XXX or XXY zygotes. Discovery of an XXX female (Jacobs, et al., 1959) strengthened this concept of the mode of origin of such cases. The occurrence of XXXY males (Ferguson-Smith, et al, 1960; Barr and Carr, 1960) is also explicable if the same type of nondisjunction also occurs in the testis of the father.
A broader causal framework is necessary to account for the XXYY males who have now been found (Muldal and Ockey, 1960; Barr and Carr, 1960; Ellis, et al., 1961) . If nondisjunction can occur at the second meiotic division in the testis, XX- or YY- bearing sperm can be produced, making possible not only XXYY but also XXXX and XYY individuals. Two XXXX females have now

been reported (Barr and Carr, 1960), lending credence to this scheme.
However, even this scheme will not account for the occurrence of XXXXY males with 49 chromosomes (Fraccaro, et al, 1960rf; Miller, et al, 19616). If nondisjunction at the first meiotic division can be followed by nondisjunction at the second meiotic division, however, XXX- and XXY- bearing sperm could be produced, and a variety of sex chromosome complements, including XXXXY, could occur at fertilization.
The discovery of these sex chromosomal abnormalities has been carried out primarily by screening mentally defective populations by interphase chromatin tests, usually based on buccal smears. Although genital abnormalities may occur in patients with chromosomal abnormalities, sexual development is usually normal, and fertility has been reported in several XXX individuals (Fraser, et al, 1960; Jacobs, et al, 1960; Stewart and Sanderson, 1960) and in one XO individual (Bahner, et al, 1960). If the interphase chromatin pattern and the presence of a male, female or intersexual phenotype are used as the basis for classifying the chromosomal abnormalities (Table 1) several points are emphasized. First, the Y- chromosome appears to be strongly male-determining, since the presence of a single Y- chromosome leads to a male phenotype even if there are as many as 4 Xchromosomes in the karyotype. Second, there appears to be a constant relationship between the number of X- chromosomes and the maximum number of interphase chromatin masses (Barr bodies, or sex chromatin masses), i.e., there is one less interphase chromatin mass than there are X-chromosomes.
A possible exception to this rule is a

group of three chromatin-positive women with gonadal dysgenesis, who, in longterm cultures of skin showed only XO cells with 45 chromosomes (Grumbach, et al., 1960). It seems likely that these cases are really chromosomal mosaics, probably XO/XX. However, Barr bodies were seen in some of the nuclei in these long-term cultures, lending support to the authors' hypothesis that the presence of a single X-chromosome is sufficient for the appearance of the sex chromatin mass. An objection to this could be raised, since the interphase chromatin pattern of cells in culture is not perfectly correlated with the chromatin pattern of uncultured cells. Thus, in one patient with 49 chromosomes, Fraccaro et al. (1960d) found three Barr bodies in a proportion of buccal mucosal cells but only one Barr body per nucleus in long-term cultured cells. It is likely that the female patients with 47 chromosomes reported by de Carli et al. (1960) and by Sandberg et al. (1960a) as examples of autosomal trisomy are really trisomic for the X-chromosome, since both patients were chromatin-two-positive. Crooke and Hayward (1960) determined the karyotype of a man who was chromatin-two-positive. Bone marrow culture produced an almost equal number of XX cells with 46 chromosomes and XXY cells with 47 chromo-

somes. In the face of these exceptional cases, no general conclusions about the relations of the various sex chromatin patterns to the X-chromosome complement seem warranted at this time.
The third point which could be made from Table I is that these abnormal sex chromosome complements, errors of sex determination, do not affect sex differentiation. The exceptions to this are (1) females with a single X-chromosome in their karyotype; they usually have abnormal (dysgenetic) gonads with ovarian stroma and sometimes even a few seminiferous tubules with otherwise female phenotype; and (2) c h r o m o s o m a l mosaics, one of whose two or more karyotypes is characteristically associated with feminine development, and another with masculine development; the resultant phenotype may be intersexual (vide infra).
Mosaicism. Soon after discovery of individuals with XXY and XO sex chromosome complements, Ford and co-workers, using short-term bone marrow cultures, found individuals with the same clinical syndromes who had two cell types with respect to chromosome number and karyotype. A chromatin-positive male was a mosaic of XXY- and XX- containing cells (Ford, et. al., 1959c). One chromatin-negative and two chromatinpositive females with Turner's syndrome were XO/XX mosaics (Ford, 1959). Further reports of mosaicism in Klinefelter's syndrome (Nowakowski, et al., 1960) and in Turner's syndrome, or gonadal dysgenesis (Fraccaro, et. al., 1960a; Sandberg, et al, 19606), leave little doubt as to the reality of this phenomenon. The two or more cell types are not always demonstrable in a single culture, even of blood or bone marrow. Consequently, the presence of mosaicism cannot be ruled out unless

28 Miller et al.

cultures are made from multiple sites or tissues; even then, mosaicism cannot be completely dismissed.
There are two main types of mosaicism: that in which the two cell lines differ by a single chromosome, and that in which they differ by a pair of homologous chromosomes. The former is produced by a process of chromosome loss, e.g., by anaphase lag; the latter is produced by somatic, i.e., mitotic, nondisjunction, and can give rise to complex mosaics with three or more cell lines if nondisjunction occurs at the 2-cell stage or later in embryonic development.
Chromosome loss from an XX zygote would give rise to an XO/XX mosaic; from an XY zygote, either an XO/XY or YO/XY mosaic. The viability of YO cells, even in a YO/XY organism, is highly dubious, and the fate of a twocelled embryo composed of one viable and one inviable cell is also questionable. However, XO/XY mosaics may be relatively common; we (Hirschhorn, et al, 1960; Miller, et al, 1961a, c) have described three such cases, and Blank et al (1960) another. All were chromatinnegative and all had intersexual phenotypes. One of the patients was masculinized but had female genital structures except for a right-sided gonadal mass made up of abundant clumps of Leydig cells, abnormal seminiferous tubules, a small bit of ovarian stroma and a large seminoma. The left gonad was absent. We found about equal numbers of XO and XY cells in repeated blood cell cultures, but only XO cells in a longterm culture of tissue from the left gonadal area (Miller, et al, 1961c).
Similar clinical abnormalities were present in two individuals who were reported to be XO from the analysis of cells from a skin biopsy in one case (Bloise, et al, 1960) and from bone

marrow in the other (Ferguson-Smith and Johnston, 1960). It is likely that both these individuals are XO/XY mosaics. It also seems likely that any analysis carried out on a single tissue may fail to reveal mosaicism and therefore will give misinformation on the frequency of the various types of chromosomal abnormalities.
Somatic, or mitotic, nondisjunction is the process by which a cell gives rise to two cell lines which differ by two homologous chromosomes, i.e., one daughter cell has lost a chromosome, which has been incorporated in the nucleus of the other daughter cell. For example, an XX zygote may produce XO and XXX daughter cells by somatic nondisjunction. If this had not occurred until the 2-celled stage or later, then a proportion of the cells would still be XX, and the organism would be an XO/XX/XXX mosaic.
Somatic nondisjunction is thus a cause of chromosomal mosaicism, the complexity of which depends upon the karyotype of the zygote, the number of cells in the organism when nondisjunction occurs, and the selective value of the various cell lines in the given environment. Jacobs et al. (1960) examined metaphase chromosomes in cultures from four different tissues of an XO/XXX mosaic. Examination of only one tissue could have led them to the wrong interpretation of this individual's chromosomal abnormality.
Four types of mosaicism can occur as a result of mitotic nondisjunction in an XY zygote: XO/XYY, XO/XY/XYY, YO/XXY and YO/XY/XXY. It is impossible to predict whether YO cells would be viable in such a mosaic embryo, or what effect such cells, viable or inviable, would have on the developing organism. We have recently found a cast

Human Cytogenetics

of XYY/XO mosaicism (Cooper, et al., 1961). The chromatin-negative patient had a female phenotype, primary amenorrhea and absence of secondary sexual development. A diagnosis of gonadal dysgenesis was made, and was confirmed by finding typical streak gonads at laparotomy. Peripheral blood cell culture and chromosome analysis revealed only cells with 47 chromosomes and XYY sex chromosome complement. Long-term cultures of skin showed the presence of both XO and XYY cells, with a preponderance of the XO type. It seems likely that the gonadal anlagen consisted predominantly of XO cells, although all that we can really say is that the region which mediates the maledetermining action of the Y chromosome was probably composed of XO cells. Since this action need only involve testicular differentiation and must at least involve this, the simplest explanation of the findings in this case is that the gonadal primordia were made up predominantly of XO cells, as we found in the XO/XY mosaic discussed above.
Interchange, gain or loss of chromosomal material. Deletion of a portion of a human chromosome has not been proven. However, Jacobs et al. (1960) have reported a mitotic chromosome analysis which they interpret as showing a deletion of a portion of the long arm of one of the X-chromosomes. The patient had gonadal dysgenesis and buccal mucosal cells showed 7 per cent very small chromatin masses, i.e., neither chromatinpositive nor chromatin-negative.
Another type of chromosome anomaly has been found in three chromatinpositive patients with gonadal dysgenesis (Fraccaro, et al, 19606). All had a chromosome number of 46, but with an additional chromosome in group 1-3 and one too few in group 6-12 (plus X ) .

Fraccaro interpreted this to mean that one X-chromosome was much larger, probably as the result of an abnormal division at the centromere, producing an iso-chromosome X with identical arms.
NORMAL VARIATIONS
Our concept of the normal human karyotype is based on the analysis of mitotic chromosomes in rapidly growing tissues (bone marrow, etc.) or tissue cultures of solid tissues, bone marrow or peripheral blood. Karyotypes from all these tissues, and from many normal individuals, are quite similar. However, the techniques now in use are relatively crude, and relatively large variations in the karyotype might go unnoticed. The gradual improvement in methods, particularly in blood cell cultures, has made it possible to detect some variability within the normal karyotype.
One variable was noted almost as soon as the peripheral blood technique was applied. The small satellite bodies present on some or all of the acrocentric autosomes (Fig. 1) are much more prominent in peripheral blood preparations than in those from skin or bone marrow. It has also been possible to observe asymmetry of these satellites, where one member of a pair of acrocentric chromosomes carried considerably larger satellites than its presumed homologous partner (Fig. 1). Such "giant satellites" were first reported by Tjio et al. (1960), who found them in two patients with Marfan's syndrome. Similar satellite variants have been reported by Chu (1961) and Buckton and Harnden (1961). In each case the enlarged satellites were found in subjects with congenital abnormalities. Except for Chu's cases, no family studies were done. In Chu's cases, the variation may be one involving the short arms of chromosome

22, rather than the satellites. We have found two families in which such giant satellites appear to have been transmitted from a normal parent to three of four children (Cooper and Hirschhorn, 1961). In each family the index patient was phenotypically abnormal and carried giant satellites. One parent and two of three sibs in each family also carried the satellites. They were clinically normal. Such giant satellites appear, then, to be a structural chromosomal variant within the range of normality. They may actually be a size variant of normal satellites, or they may represent minor translocations of chromosomal material. In the latter case, the giant satellites might be compatible with normal development, but also conducive to abnormalities of the offspring such as those found in the reported cases. These abnormalities may arise through the possession of excess or deficient quantities of genetic material presumably carried in the translocated

giant satellites. The mechanism of such variable distribution in translocations has been described by Carter et al. (1960) in a discussion of familial mongolism associated with 15/21 translocation. This may be the explanation of the fact that in Chu's case with giant satellites there were several mongoloid idiots in one family, none of whom had trisomy for chromosome 21, but all of whom had giant satellites, presumably on chromosome 22. The frequency of this and other types of minor variants will be determined only by study of unselected normal individuals.
Giant satellites may be important for another reason. Since they are transmitted with the chromosomes carrying them, giant satellites may serve as chromosomal markers. Demonstration of linkage between them and known genetic traits may then localize specific genes on specific chromosomes. This would be an important step toward human chromosome mapping.

LEUKEMIA, RADIATION AND CANCER
Another application of the techniques of human chromosome examination has been the attempt to find a possible relationship between leukemia and chromosomal aberrations. Baikie et al. (1959) reported several cases of acute leukemia in whom short-term bone marrow cultures revealed nonspecific chromosomal aberrations in many cells. Sandberg et al. (1960&) reported similar findings. They found no abnormalities in their cases of chronic leukemia. Later, Nowell and Hungerford (1960) and Baikie et al. (1960) reported that, using the peripheral blood technique, they consistently found an unusually small chromosome in subjects with chronic myeloid leukemia. Nowell's group interpreted this as an unusually small Y chromosome, while Baikie's group considered it a number 22 chromosome with a deletion in the long arm. No abnormality was found in cells from skin cultures. If this is verified by future work, it is a very exciting advance in the understanding of the pathogenesis of chronic leukemia. It remains to be determined whether the aberration arises in a clone of atypical cells overgrowing the normal bone marrow population, or whether mosaicism is present and the atypical cell represents the true cell type of the hematopoetic tissue which predisposes to the development of chronic leukemia.
The frequently reported association betweeh radiation and leukemia, and the demonstration of chromosomal defects induced by irradiation in vitro
(Puck, 1960) have prompted investigators to examine the effects of heavy doses of therapeutic radiation on chromosomes
in vivo. Tough et al. (1960) investigated a series of subjects receiving radio-

therapy for ankylosing spondylitis. Serial studies of chromosomes from peripheral blood revealed a sudden appearance of cells with a variety of chromosomal aberrations immediately after radiation exposure. These gradually diminished over a period of several weeks. This direct demonstration of abnormalities of chromosomes induced by radiation is highly suggestive, in view of the reported high incidence of leukemia in patients with ankylosing spondylitis treated by radiotherapy (Graham, 1960).
Miller (1961) demonstrated a significant increase in the proportion of metaphase cells with more than the modal number of chromosomes in blood cell cultures of some patients with gonadal or uterine cancers. Whether some of these aneuploid cells were cancer cells, or whether a difference in the plasma of some of these cancer patients is responsible for the increased heteroploidy, remains to be determined.
SUMMARY
Recent developments in human cytogenetics have been reviewed. The use of blood cell cultures as a source of mitotic cells has resulted in new knowledge of chromosomal detail and has greatly extended the applicability of chromosome analyses. As more family studies are carried out, the genetic basis of the variability of the chromosomes, e.g., the satellites, is coming more clearly into view.
Several new autosomal trisomic syndromes have been discovered. However, new sex chromosome abnormalities are still being discovered at a more rapid rate.
More examples of sex chromosomal mosaicism have been reported, some of them only discovered by the examination of two or more tissues or biopsy sites.

This technique is rapidly becoming es-
sential fordefinitive study of a newcase.
The investigation of chromosomal aber-
rations in leukemia, other forms of can-
cer, and after radiation exposure has
developed as a useful approach to these
problems.
