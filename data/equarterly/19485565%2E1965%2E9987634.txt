BACKGROUND
Our population studies in Taiwan are designed to answer in part two sets of questions about that stage of the demographic transition in which mortality has been low for some time and fertility has just begun to decline:
1. Prior to any organized family planning program what changes occur "naturally" in fertility and family planning and what sectors of the population change first and most?
2. Can the process of fertility decline be accelerated in a short period in a large population by a massive program to help married couples have the number of children they want? If such a program is effective, what sectors of the population and what aspects of the program are responsible for the success?
Taiwan is a particularly appropriate place in which to study these questions. For some time it has had low mortality and significant progress in social development, conditions which are probably facilitating, if not essential for rapid fertility decline.1 Compared to other developing countries, Taiwan ranks high on such measures as literacy, circulation

of mass media, nonagricultural employment, involvement in a market economy, etc. We interpret a high ranking on such measures to indicate increasing involvement of the Taiwanese population in social and economic relations transcending traditional local and familial settings.
Fertility has been falling slowly all over Taiwan since 1958, without benefit of any large-scale organized family planning program. The fertility decline, described in detail elsewhere (Freedman, et al., 1963) for the period 1958-1962, continued in 1963 in every one of the five large cities and the 17 other administrative units of Taiwan. The pattern of fertility decline by age is especially significant:

The declines begin to appear at age 30 to 34 and then increase sharply with age. This is exactly what we would expect if many women want a moderate number of living children, achieve this by age 30, and then begin to try to limit family size in some way. This is the case, indeed, in the city of Taichung in which

we have conducted sample surveys, both to study the fertility and family planning patterns and to evaluate the success of a family planning program which might change fertility.
Taichung, a city of more than 300,000 people, is the capital of the Province of Taiwan and its fourth largest city. As in many Asian cities, its administrative boundaries include both a densely settled urban core containing about twothirds of the population and a large semi-rural area of farms. A large proportion of those living in the urban core are migrants with a farm background. Apart from variation on the rural-urban dimension, the population is sufficiently heterogenous with respect to indicators of modernization to permit analysis of their effects on fertility (for example, education, family type, type of employment).
One of our principal sources of data for Taichung is the intensive interview survey of a probability sample of 2,432 of the 36,000 married women in the child-bearing years (defined as 20 to 39 years old for this purpose). This sample was first interviewed in NovemberDecember of 1962 and reinterviewed in November-December 1963 after themain part of the family planning action program was completed.2
2The preprogram survey was done in two stages. Interviews were taken in NovemberDecember 1962 with a probability sample of 1,367 married women 20 to 39 years old in Taichung City. Then in January 1963 interviews were taken with an additional probability sample of 1,065 married women 20 to 39 years old with at least two living children. The two samples were combined by weighting, by a factor of two, the interviews from the first survey with wives having less than two living children (a rather small minority). The frequencies shown for the total sample are based on this "inflated" sample of 2,713 cases. We actually interviewed only 2,432 women so frequencies in the total sample should be deflated by approximately 10%. The second set of interviews were shorter than the first, so some of the data presented are based only on the first sample. The response rate for

Some of the important results of the
first preprogram survey reported in pre-
vious publications (Freedman, et al.,
1963, 1964) will be summarized here in
outline form as a background for con-
sidering new analyses:
1. There is a strong consensus in the population that a moderate number of children and sons is what they want for themselves and consider ideal for others.3
2. Under existing mortality conditions most women nave the moderate number of children and sons they want early in the child-bearing period --by the time they are 30 to 34 and often earlier.
3. Most people know about the decline of mortality and are aware that this means that most of their children will survive to be adults.
4. Under these conditions it is not unexpected that a large majority of wives and husbands approve the idea of doing something to limit family size and indicate an interest in learning how to do this.
5. A significant minority of couples have begun to practice some form of family limitation, but the practice is often either too ineffective or too late to enable the couples to limit their families to the desired size.
6. The strata of the population which are most modern in other ways also have the most modern fertility behavior and lead the way in adopting family planning methods in the period before the organized action program. In characterizing such groups as hav-
the two samples combined (and unweighted) is 97%. After the action program the same sample was reinterviewed. The response rate for the reinterview was 96% of those still remaining in Taichung. Five per cent of the original sample moved out of Taichung and was not followed. The refusal rate was only 1%. Most of the noninterviews were for couples who moved to unknown destinations.
3It is very important in this culture to have at least two children and at least one son, but there is no desire for large families or unlimited numbers of sons. Three or four children with one or two sons is the modal ideal. Those who have large numbers are not reluctant to say that they would prefer fewer or, at least, prefer no more.

ing modern fertility behavior, we mean that:
--They want the fewest children. --More of the children they have
survive. --They are more likely to do some-
thing to limit family size and especially to use contraception. --They are less likely to rely exclusively on abortion. --They have the lowest fertility-- this is the net result.
Now which groups have the modern fertility characteristics? We have provided detailed evidence elsewhere (Freedman, et al., 1963, 1964) that they are:
--The better educated and those who read the mass media.
--Those who own the most modern objects of consumption.
--Those living in nuclear rather than in stem or joint families.
--Those who are least favorable to traditional Chinese family values.
--Those with no farm experience, especially migrants from large cities.
--Those who work in an impersonal setting as employees of nonrelatives.
--Those who have received information about family planning from multiple sources.
To illustrate the kind of data on
which these sweeping generalizations are
based, we present in Table 1 for the
wives 35 to 39 years old the relationships
between two of these important criteria
of modernization (wife's education and
number of modern objects owned) and
the fertility and family planning vari-
ables.
In general, the use of some form of
family limitation is more consistently re-
lated to the indices of modernization
than any single method of limitation
considered or the measures of desired or
actual fertility. We interpret this to
mean that those with more modern
characteristics try various methods to

limit family size, but their practice of these methods is frequently either so late or so ineffective that it does not limit family size to the desired level, although it does produce a rather consistent fertility differential.
That the practice of family limitation is still ineffective is indicated by the fact that at age 35 to 39 the total number of children born or alive is higher than desired by the wife for every subcategory considered. This is true despite the fact that the use of some method reaches more than 75% for the advanced categories and includes sterilization for as many as 25% of the wives in some categories.
Data, not previously reported, about the percentage pregnant at the time of the first survey interview (Table 2) indicate that it is likely that the more important specific fertility differentials will be even larger than now when the women have completed their childbearing. Those groups with the lowest fertility at ages over 30 also have the lowest current pregnancy rates. For example, current pregnancy rates are negatively correlated with the couple's education or the number of objects owned.
The current pregnancy rates in Table 2 also confirm the continuing importance of having sons. Comparing women with similar numbers of children alive, those without a son have higher pregnancy rates than those with at least one son.
NEW MULTIVARIATE ANALYSES OF THE
PREPROGRAM SURVEY
Obviously, many of the modernization variables we have considered must be overlapping in their content and in their effect on family planning. Such an important modernization variable as education, for example, is known to be correlated rather strongly with such other

variables as number of modern objects owned or attitudes to traditional familial values. It is desirable to know how much of the variance in the behavior is explained by each of these variables and how much additional explanation is achieved by considering them in combinations. We can present here only a preliminary report in which the dependent variable is the proportion who have used any form of family limitation (contraception, abortion, or sterilization).*
4The method used here is "multiple classifiation" analysis. (For explanations and examples of use, see D. S. Freedman, 1963; Morgan, et al., 1962.) Essentially, this is a regression procedure in which each category of each independent variable is a predictor (having the value zero or one). It is unnecessary to consider the categories as having any rank order, and there are no assumptions about the scaling of the variables or linearity of the variables. In the particular case in which we have used family limitation practice as the dependent variable, we have assigned a value of 0 to those who have not and of 1 to those who have practiced family limitation.

Consider first the education and reading variables. Since husband's education added little to the explanatory effect of wife's education (Table 3), we used a husband-wife education code for the subsequent analyses. This husband-wife education code, together with measures of the frequency of newspaper reading by husband and wife, accounts for 16.1% of the total variance. The educationreading variables probably indicate whether the couple has access to specific information about family planning and the small family pattern. Perhaps more important, they may measure roughly the contact of the couple with ideas and systems of interaction beyond local and familial groups. The measures of association for education and reading are in each case somewhat larger for the wife than for the husband. This may indicate the special importance of drawing the wife into the modern sector at least so far as family planning is concerned.
Another important variable is the number of modern consumer objects owned. This is a useful index of a modern standard of living and one way in which the couple is drawn into a modern economic sector. Adding this variable to the education-reading cluster brings the explained variance to 18.7%. It is much more strongly associated with use of family limitation than is husband's income. How income is spent apparently is more important than how much there is. Money can be used to achieve traditional rather than new values. Husband's income adds very little to the explained variance associated with the education variables alone.
Very little is gained in explained variance by adding to education-reading and number of modern objects owned such other variables as husband's work status,

wife's attitude to traditional familial values, or farm background.
Almost all of the variables considered individually have a reasonable and statistically significant relationship to the use of family planning. Whatever is involved in the other variables is, however, covered by education-reading and the number of modern objects owned, so far as the effect on family limitation practice is concerned.
As a by-product of the multiple-classification procedure, Table 4 shows indetail how the proportion using family

limitation differs from the average for each category of each variable: (1) when considered alone, and then (2) when various other groups of variables are taken into account. A detailed consideration of these data is not possible here, but the utility of this type of analysis can be illustrated with one example, education. Note that before considering other variables, there is a steady increase from 20% below the average in the lowest educational category to 32% above average in the highest. If we "adjust" these figures to take out the effect of newspaper reading by husband and wife --a functional test of the meaning of education--the relationship with education persists but is much less steep, the variation (Column A) being from --6% to +18%. If we add an adjustment for number of modern objects, the relationship becomes less steep (Column B). But adjusting for husband's employment status and wife's traditional attitudes makes little difference (Column C)--the effects which these might have presumably are already taken into account. After adjusting for all these variables, the highest two educational groups still stand out as distinctive. The wife's educational level, i.e., junior versus senior level, has a significant residual effect on the use of family limitation after all of the other five variables are taken into account. Adjusting for rural background makes little difference in the effects of education when we allow for the effect of reading (Column D). On the other hand, the small effects of farm background are completely removed when that variable is adjusted for education-reading.
The numbers of living children and sons influence the use of family limitation independently of the social variables just considered. In another multiple classification analysis, the explained variance was raised to 25.2% by adding

a combined code on "number of living children and sons" to the educationreading variables, the number of modern objects owned, farm background, and wife's traditional attitudes. Almost none of the influence of the number-of-children-and-sons variable overlaps the influence of the social variables, so adding this demographic variable substantially increases the variance explained. It appears that both the demographic and the social variables have significant and independent influences in the adoption of family limitation prior to a planned program.
THE DESIGN OF THE EXPERIMENTAL
ACTION PROGRAM
The preprogram survey, indicating so clearly that a large part of the population wanted help in family limitation, encouraged the Provincial Health Department of Taiwan to provide the help. For this purpose an experimental action program was developed that must be one of the largest social science studies ever conducted under controlled conditions.
In most general terms, the objective of the program was to see how much family planning action could be increased by a massive program of short duration. A corollary major objective was to observe whether the birth rate for the city would fall substantially. As far as we know, no population this large has ever had a significant birth rate decline as a consequence of an organized program for dissemination of family planning ideas.
Another major objective was to test the power of indirect diffusion by word of mouth in a whole population in which were placed systematically spaced, direct-influence foci from which diffusion could take place. This general objective seems especially important in

view of considerable, if unsystematic, evidence that word-of-mouth diffusion through informal communication networks was principally responsible for the spread of family limitation ideas in Japan and the West. The research question was whether messages about family planning can be placed in this informal network on a massive basis to speed the process of diffusion in a short period.
Apart from these general objectives, the action study was designed to provide partial answers to a number of important basic questions about how best to conduct such a program and what groups would respond most readily. The more specific objectives were to test the success of the program:
--When couples get intensive personal visits by a nurse-midwife.
--When both husband and wife, rather than wives only, receive such personal visits.
--When mailings only are used to provide information and support.
--When couples not reached directly in any way are surrounded by neighborhoods in which there are intensive direct influence.
--In different strata. Do the modernized strata of society lead in acceptance? Is the number of children and of sons important?
The basic unit in the research action design is the lin--a neighborhood unit containing an average of about 20 households, of which, on the average, about 12 have women aged 20 to 39 years. Taichung is divided officially into about 2,400 such neighborhood units. Each lin was assigned to one of 12 cells in an overall experimental design for Taichung involving four treatments and three diffusion-intensity sectors, as shown in Table 5. The four treatments range from much to little effort as follows:
1. Everything--husband and wife: In these lins all of the stimuli of the

program are combined; personal visits by trained health workers for information and supporting motivation, mailings of information, and meetings in the neighborhood, mixing entertainment and information about family planning.
2. Everything--wife only: This involves all the major stimuli except the personal visit to the husband.
3. Mailings: No personal visits (unless requested) or meetings in the neighborhood; instead, a series of mailings of letters and pamphlets provide information on methods, rationale, location of clinics, etc., and includes a return-postal device to request more information or a personal visit from a field worker.
4. Nothing: No direct effort is made; there are posters in the area, and meetings are held at the li level (a larger neighborhood unit of about 350 households).
Each lin was assigned to one of these
four treatments. It was also located in
one of three "density" sectors which dif-
fered, so far as possible, only in the pro-
portion of lins getting the more intensive
treatments. For this purpose the city
was divided into three approximately
equal pie-shaped sectors, roughly equated
initially on fertility, rural-urban distri-
bution, and educational level. Within

each of the three sectors all the lins were distributed randomly among the four treatments in the proportions indicated in Table 5. In Sector I the largest proportion (50%) and in Sector III the smallest proportion (20%) of the lins were assigned to the "everything" treatments. All couples in the lins of a particular treatment type were supposed to get the same direct message regardless of the sector in which they were located. They differed only in the percentage of the surrounding lins getting other treatments. For example, those in the "nothing" lins in Sector I had an environment in which many of the neighboring lins were getting the intensive treatment; "nothing" lins in Sector III had an environment in which relatively few of the surrounding lins were getting intensive treatment.
In addition to the specific treatments, there were some citywide mass-media messages, limited to a very small volume by a local policy decision. In view of the literacy of the population and the excellent mass media available, we believe that major supporting use of such media would have increased the success of the program considerably.

thousand copies of a set of 15 posters also were placed in prominent locations. Some of these carried informaton about the location of the clinics, but mainly they presented the idea of family planning in simple, attractive form. There were also a considerable number of meetings with community leaders and with functional groups, such as the farmers' association and the pedicab drivers' association.
Family planning services and supplies were offered at ten clinics located throughout the city. Information, services, and supplies were offered with respect to the diaphragm, jelly, foam tablets, condom, withdrawal, rhythm, oral contraceptives, and the new intrauterine devices. No effort was made to set up a design that would rigidly test the attractiveness of different methods, but the interest in the intrauterine device was so great, as we shall see presently, that its attraction for this population can hardly be doubted.
The extensive experimental program ran from February to October 1963. To test the continuing momentum of the program, clinic and informational services continued to be available for those asking for them but without any attempt to find new cases actively. As some indication of the scope of the program, nearly 12,000 first home visits and over 500 lin meetings were held by June 1963. Follow-up visits of various kinds probably ran to more than 20,000.
The action program was intended to help those who wanted to limit family size rather than to persuade people that they should want to do so. The former is by far the easier task and, in our opinion, it may be the efficient way to begin any large program.
Three sources of data will be available to evaluate the results:
1. The official register can be used to determine fertility rates for Tai-

chung as compared with other large cities and other administrative units of Taiwan. Other comparisons will also be made for lins and groups of lins as they are sorted into 12 cells of the experimental design.
2. The before-and-after panel survey of the 2,432 married women that has already been described.
3. Extensive data can be drawn from short questionnaires for about 4,000 women who came to the clinics and from approximately 12,000 home visits. A major part of our report on results to date is based on these records.
RESULTS OF THE ACTION PROGRAM:
A PRELIMINARY REPORT
How successful has the program been? Perhaps the most important test will be the course of the birth rate in the next year or two, but a preliminary evaluation of results on other bases is possible.
One criterion is the number of couples who accepted family planning directly from the program clinics or representatives. Acceptance is defined as the actual insertion of an intrauterine contraceptive device (I.U.C.D.) or the receipt of instruction and the purchase of supplies for other methods with expressed intention to use them.
A total of 3,968 couples (including 764 from outside Taichung) were registered as acceptors between early February and November 10, 1963. The 3,204 cases from the City of Taichung represent 9% of the married women aged 20 to 39 years. After the formal program for finding acceptors ended in the fall of 1963, women continued to come to the clinics without any formal program of recruitment. By May 2, 1964, the number of acceptors had reached 6,188, of whom 25% were from outside the city, and 78% were I.U.C.D. cases.
But many of the wives were really not eligible to accept family planning. For example, this is certainly true of the ap-

proximately 10% who had been surgically sterilized and of an additional number who believed themselves to be sterile. By excluding women ineligible by various criteria of this type, we arrive at a range of estimates of the percentage of eligibles who became acceptors. A number of such preliminary estimates have been prepared based on the data up to October 15 for the approximately 2,400 women in the intensive survey sample. For example, in one estimate, we excluded as ineligible the women who were believed to be sterile and also those who already were using a contraceptive method they found acceptable, unless they became acceptors in the program. On this basis, only 71% of the wives were eligible, and the acceptance rate rises from the initial 9% to 13%.
A next step is to exclude as ineligible, in addition, women who wanted more children at the first interview (unless they became acceptors in the program). This additional exclusion decreases the percentage eligible to 42% and increases the acceptance rate to 21%.
In earlier calculations, we had excluded as ineligible women who were pregnant at the first interview or at the first home visit. However, we found later in the postprogram interviews that the percentage of acceptors among these women was greater than in the sample as a whole, presumably because these women were more often in contact with health personnel in prenatal and antenatal services as well as at the time of delivery. The issue of family planning may also have been much more salient for them. A different approach will have to be developed for the pregnant women, providing an adjustment for the number of months of ineligibility by reason of pregnancy.
Not all of the acceptors are new to the practice of family planning. As of October 15, 1963, 37% of the acceptors had

previously tried some form of contraception and were dissatisfied with it. Indications are that this group is partly balanced by the couples who adopted some form of family limitation outside of the program itself but in many cases as a consequence of the influence of the program.
As our colleague, Bernard Berelson, has pointed out (Berelson and Freedman, 1964), these kinds of calculations simply illustrate that in a population of this type at any one time "somewhere between half and three-fourths of the target population is simply out of bounds for the purpose. If a program can get as many as a half--or even a third or a fourth--of the remaining group to begin the program of contraception within a few years, it has achieved a good deal. In this kind of work, then, having an impact on 10 per cent of the target population in a year or so is not a disappointing failure but a substantial success; one should report, 'Fully 10 per cent,1 not 'Only 10 per cent!' "
It is clear that we need research criteria for evaluating the "success" of programs in populations with changing panels of eligibles. A significant number of cases classified as ineligible at one or another time during the program became cases in the program before it was concluded because of follow-up visits when a temporary barrier (e.g., pregnancy) was passed. One solution is to cite the results with a range of defined bases, such as the range of 9 to 21% of eligibles already cited. Other criteria and later data raise the percentage to more than 30%.5
Diffusion and informal communication channels proved to be as important
5The higher rates result from adding to the ineligible group some proportion of the pregnant, the lactating, and others in amenhorea as well as from making allowance for the acceptances after October 15, 1963, considerable in number.

here as they have been elsewhere where family planning has reached large populations. Perhaps the most striking evidence is that by October 15, 1963, 20% of all the acceptances came from outside the city, although the formal program was limited to the city itself. About 65% of these outside cases came from Taichung Hsien, the administrative unit surrounding the city, but another 25% came from the next two adjacent hsiens. The remaining 10% came from more distant places all over the island.
Approximately 50% of all the cases from inside the city came without benefit of a home visit, although the "everything" home-visit lins did have a higher acceptance rate than any others. Even in the "everything" home-visit lins, 17% of all acceptors visited the clinics before the home visitor could get to them. Word of mouth spread the news faster than the home visitors could make their rounds I
The indirect impact of the program has been mediated first of all by wordof-mouth communication of friends, relatives, and neighbors and second by regular health station personnel and the program's home visitors who apparently talked to people on their rounds in addi-

tion to home visits (Table 6). It is our impression, so far, that to an appreciable extent the indirect diffusion is attributable to the involvement of a considerable number of people scattered over the whole city and moving about in it. Thus, there are multiple sources of possible influence and communication which are mutually and cumulatively reinforcing.
The indirect diffusion effect can be seen also in the percentage of acceptances in each of the 12 cells of the experimental design, as shown in Table 7. Although, as expected, the proportion of acceptors is largest in the "everything" lins, the response in the "nothing" and "mail" lins without any direct contact is not inconsiderable. The acceptance rate was highest in the heavy-density sector for each of the four treatments. There was no significant difference between the medium and light sectors.6
6The density variations were related to whether those indicating an intention to become acceptors in the home visits did so in fact. In the data for the period up to August 10, 1963, the percentage of acceptors among all those indicating a future intention to be acceptors was by sector: I (Heavy)--60%; II (Medium)-- 48%; III (Light)--40 per cent. Apparently more reinforcement in the environment helps to move people from intentions to action.

Other preliminary findings shown in Table 7 suggest that mailings were rather ineffectiveT and that including the husband in home visits made little difference. This latter finding needs to be explored more thoroughly both in the Taichung data and elsewhere in view o£ its theoretical and practical importance.8
The study has clearly demonstrated
7The fact that mailings were not more effective may very well be a result of the fact that they contained no information about the I.U.C.D., which turned out to be almost the only attraction for the non-home-visit cases.
8 It is possible that male workers for the men might have made a difference in the results. However, we have no reason to believe that the female health workers did not have good rapport with the husbands.

the overwhelming appeal of the intrauterine devices in this area. Seventy-four per cent of all acceptances up to November 10, 1963, were I.U.C.D. cases.9 It might be argued that the workers put more emphasis on this method and that this accounts for its popularity. This seems very unlikely, since the I.U.C.D. was selected by only 49% of acceptors who had had a home visit and by 89% of those who heard about the program in other ways (Table 8). Further, among those who came from outside the city,
9Among the cases coming after the close of the formal program the overwhelming majority were I.U.C.D. cases, so that by May 2, 1964, 78% of the total number of acceptances were I.U.C.D. cases.

a very large majority--97%--were attracted by the intrauterine devices.10 There seems to be little doubt that the success of the program as a whole depended considerably on the availability of the I.U.C.D. with all its advantages. We do not know what would have happened if it had not been available.
We have just begun to assemble the data on acceptance rates for the various demographic and social strata. Again the question of eligibility becomes a problem. In Table 9, for a few of the major variables, we compare the distribution of the acceptors with the distribution of the total survey sample and also

with the distribution of the sample cases "eligible" in the sense that they were not sterilized or using a method of contraception that satisfied them at the beginning of the program.
As compared with the "eligible" couples, disproportionate numbers of acceptances are older wives, have three or more (and especially four or more) living children, and have at least one living son.
Contrary to expectation, a larger proportion of acceptors were from rural districts than was the case for the eligible women. Even taking eligibility into account, the demographic characteristics-- wife's age and the number of living children and sons--appear to be much more important than the two social characteristics considered so far.

We can only speculate now that in this situation where a general interest in family planning exists at all social levels and where desired family size is moderate at all levels, couples at the right demographic stage can be attracted to family limitation by an organized program which moves the undecided and the ill-informed to action. Having the "modern" social characteristics may be more important in the natural, unplanned development of family planning in which initiative and individual seeking for information and supplies are required.
It is important that significant proportions of acceptors are coming from the demographic and social strata generally considered unpromising. Among the wives who are acceptors, 45% are under 30 years of age; 16% have fewer than three living children; 6% have no sons; and 30% have no education. In part this is a result of the large numbers of women in these categories and the large proportion of them who are eligible by almost any criterion. But such results would not be possible without a rather high acceptance rate even in these unpromising strata. It is a hopeful sign for the longrun success of such programs in Taiwan that they are reaching these large groups that have a long period of childbearing ahead of them.
We have ranged intentionally in this report over various aspects of the research in Taiwan to illustrate both the richness of the material that is becoming available and the rapidity with which significant results can be reported. It has been necessary to treat very lightly many topics that will require the much more intensive analysis that we plan to do.
POSTSCRIPT: SUMMER 1965
The preceding report was prepared on the basis of the analysis of data available

a year ago. In the meantime, additional data have become available, and the analysis has been carried further in some ways. In general, the newer data and the additional analyses do not contradict the major findings reported above, but there are some interesting new results and insights.
First of all, women have continued to come into the clinics for family planning guidance, although the intensive program to recruit new cases ended in October 1963.11 In the postprogram period, the proportion of cases coming from outside the city has been even higher than before, and the preference for the I.U.C.D. has become even greater, especially in the cases coming from outside the city. It is clear that the I.U.G.D. has diffused more easily than the traditional methods. Table 10 shows the cumulative distribution of acceptances by method and location to June 1, 1965.
We also note that between 1963 (the year of the intensive program) and 1964 the birth rate fell more in Taichung than in any of the other major cities of Taiwan:

City
Taichung Taipei Keelung Tainan Kaohsiung

Percentage decline in total fertility rate, 1963-64
-6.3 -2.6 -2.2 -3.7 -3.9

Taichung's advantage, while substantial, is not so large as we had expected.
11There is, however, since the beginning of 1964, an island-wide program of family planning involving home visits, group meetings, mailings, etc. These efforts are much more diffuse than those in Taichung during its experimental program; besides, Taichung was "left alone" until April 1, 1964, after which date some home visiting and group meeting activities were resumed to be continued on a routine basis.

This is probably due in part to the fact that the retention rate of the I.U.C.D. after a year is not so high as had been hoped (72% of the women in a medical follow-up of the Taichung cases still had the I.U.C.D. in place after a year). Further, as the following data will show, a significant proportion of the acceptors are persons who had previously tried another method; therefore, the effect on the birth rate is not so great as it might be if they were using a method for the first time following the program.
Table 11 shows the acceptance rates to April 1, 1964, by the experimental variables separately for all methods, the I.U.C.D., and for other (mainly traditional) methods. We also show for each of the 12cells of the experimental design the percentage of all acceptances which were I.U.C.D. cases. The total acceptance pattern is similar to that already discussed in the main article above. The significant point, however, is that the major differentials of the treatments and the sectors are for the traditional

methods only. The differences for I.U.C.D. acceptances are very small. In short, the intensive "everything" treatment "sold" the traditional methods, but the I.U.C.D. diffused throughout the city almost independently of theexperimental variables.
The program has had a special appeal to couples who already feel they have a problem of family limitation and who have made an unsatisfactory attempt to do something about it. For example, the acceptance rate was highest for those couples who had used a contraceptive method in the past but were not using anything when the program started:

Clearly the strongest appeal of the program is to those who have previously made some attempt to limit family size and especially to those using unsatisfactory methods.
Another way of putting this is to say that those who feel they have a problem are most interested in accepting. This is indicated further by the fact that acceptance is highest among those who have most recently demonstrated their fecun-

dity. For example, the following data indicate that acceptance rate is higher the shorter the period since the last birth, and this is especially accentuated when the previous use of some family limitation method (other than sterilization) is taken into account. The higher acceptance rates are found among those who have recently had a live birth and have tried to limit family size previously:

The influence of fecundity on the acceptance pattern is further indicated in the finding that those accepting a method in the program previously had higher fertility than those not accepting. Furthermore, those accepting the I.U.C.D. had higher fertility than those accepting other methods:
