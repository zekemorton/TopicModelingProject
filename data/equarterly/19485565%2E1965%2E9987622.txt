CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS AND SEASON OF BIRTH: A BRIEF REVIEW

JOHN C. BAILAR, III, AND JOAN GURIAN

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:28 08 December 2015

Several reports have appeared correlating congenital malformations with maternal diseases. Such correlation may be via direct influence of the disease, via medication taken for the disease, or via other external factors affecting either the mother or the fetus. The fact that many teratogenic factors, especially infectious diseases, have a seasonal pattern, gives reason for investigating correlations between date of birth and the occurrence of congenital malformation.
A simple example is the well-known correlation between maternal infections with rubella and the genesis of congenital defects. Since rubella is most common during late winter and early spring and since it exerts its most harmful effects on three-month fetuses, one might expect an elevated incidence of congenital malformations among infants born in the late summer and early fall. Such a pattern has in fact been observed for some congenital malformations, although it has not been directly linked to specific maternal diseases.
Monthly variations in the occurrence of congenital malformations were first reported many years ago (Dittrich, 1929; Peterson, cited by Huntington, 1938). However, these reports were given little attention or credence, probably because they were based on small numbers of cases, did not take sufficient account of seasonal variations in birth rates, were

linked by the authors to physical phenomena unlikely to produce any direct fetal effects, and were contradicted by one other early study (Murphy, cited by Huntington, 1938) which showed no significant monthly variation in the occurrence of congenital malformations.
The first carefully considered study of adequate numbers of congenital malformations was that of McKeown and Record (1951). They found that monthly rates for stillbirths attributed to anencephaly were significantly and consistently higher in December (rate 3.09 per 1,000) than in May (rate 1.91 per 1,000), with a fairly regular gradient between these two extremes. Their data correspond to a peak incidence of anencephaly among conceptions occurring March through August.
More recent work has dealt primarily with malformations of the central nervous system, the cardiovascular system, and the musculoskeletal system. The data available on central nervous system malformations (Table 1) generally show a marked winter excess in anencephaly, an equivocal winter excess in spine bifida, and no convincing cycle in hydrocephaly.
Masterson (1962), in a recent review of factors influencing the incidence of anencephaly, summarized current opinion as accepting "the existence of a genetic basis for the condition, with penetrance and expressivity strongly influenced by the associated genetic background and a host of environmental factors." It is now clear that the latter

More limited data on cardiovascular malformations (Table 2) strongly suggest a summer or autumn peak in patent ductus arteriosus. The seasonal variation may be confined to female infants. There is no convincing evidence for seasonal cycles in septal defects, tetralogyof Fallot, oraortic coarctation.

There is a distinct andmarked excess of winter births in most published series of congenital hip dislocation (Table 3). The data on cleft palate and harelip show no regular patterns.

cycle for pyloric stenosis, tracheoesophageal fistula, or exomphalos. Most recently, Slater and Watson (1964) analyzed some 9,951 cases of congenital malformations, collected in the United Kingdom and Eire, and found an excess of cataract, anencephaly, spina bifida, hydrocephaly, esophageal atresia, and congenital dislocation of the hip among winter births, while summer births are in excess among sufferers from pulmonary stenosis, aortic stenosis, other vascular defects, malformed or partially absent limbs, rectal or anal stenosis, and malformed lower G. I. tract. All malformations combined exhibited no seasonal cycle. Hewitt (1962), on the other hand, found the number of malformations (unspecified) born in New York during December, to be above expectation. Stevenson, Worcester, and Rice (1950) found no overall seasonal pattern in congenital defects, but noted a possible elevation in the third quarter of the year in the occurrence of multiple defects, presumably developed over a period of two or more months during gestation.
Reasons for observed seasonal differences in congenital diseases are not known, but most observers have attempted, with indifferent success, to relate them to month-to-month variations in maternal infections during early pregnancy. Other reasonable explanations

are that congenital dislocation of the hip may be related to immobilization of infants with heavy clothing (Nagura, 1955; Pap, 1956; Record and Edwards, 1958) and that warmth may delay the closure of the ductus arteriosus (Burnard, 1958). Still other possibly significant factors are seasonal differences in maternal nutritional status or in conception rates among persons with relevant physical or genetic factors. The recent experience with thalidomide suggests the value of looking for drugs or other materials which may be taken more often by pregnant women in one season than in another.
It is very interesting that three of the congenital conditions that have been linked with season of birth--anencephaly, patent ductus arteriosus, and congenital dislocation of the hip--show the unusual feature of being more common among females than among males; most other congenital diseases are more common among males. The observation (Ruthstein, Nickerson, and Heald, 1952; Record and McKeown, 1953; Polani and Campbell, 1955) that the seasonal pattern in patent ductus may be confined to females underlines the importance of studying the sex ratio of various congenital abnormalities with the hope of pinpointing factors related to etiology or, perhaps, to resistance. There is a clear

indication for more extensive study of this aspect of congenital malformation.
COMMENT
Seasonal cycles in births of infants with certain congenital malformations have been demonstrated beyond any reasonable doubt. However, many important questions remain unanswered. What are the direct causes of these variations? Which malformations are involved?How great are thevariations? What is the relation between theseasonal incidence of malformations andthesexof infants? Is there any reason to consider month or season in parental counseling? Will it be possible to prevent some of these malformations?
Further work to solve these questions is badly needed, but there are many methodologic problems that make careful studies difficult (Kesselman and Bailar, 1964;Bailar and Gurian, submitted for publication). It is hoped that much more extensive studies, based on sound methodologic andstatistical principles, will soon beundertaken in several different geographic areas.
