12/VEN PRIOR TO THE ANALYSIS of intelligence test scores in relation to family size, data were available which suggested an association between intellectual level and fertility. An individual's occupational and educational level reflect in large part his effectiveness in meeting a long succession of intellectual demands. Intelligence tests provide a more objective measure of a relatively standardized and limited sample of intellectual behavior. On the other hand, the behavior samples underlying occupational and educational level have the advantage of broader coverage and longer duration. Socioeconomic variables, educational level, and intelligence tests may thus be regarded as separate indices of intelligence. As might be expected, these indices are highly intercorrelated among themselves. In relatively unselected adult samples, for example, intelligence test scores correlate over .70 with amount of schooling (Anastasi, 1958, pp. 205206). Such correlations are about as high as those among a number of different intelligence tests.
SOCIOECONOMIC AND
EDUCATIONAL VARIABLES
Differential fertility in various subgroups of the population was recorded as early as the seventeenth century in Europe (Kuczynski, 1935). Sufficient data were subsequently gathered in the United States and in several European

countries to establish a significant inverse relation between fertility and such variables as income, occupational level, and amount of education (Riser, 1942; Lorimer and Osborn, 1934; Sewell, 1944; United Nations, 1953). The widespread decline in the birth rate which began in the nineteenth century was more rapid in the upper than in the lower socioeconomic and educational classes, thus either producing or augmenting these fertility differentials. One of the most persistent differentials, occurring even when other subgroup differences in family size are absent or reversed, is that between urban and rural groups. This difference usually increases when comparisons are made between agricultural and non-agricultural occupations. The largest families are thus found among those rural residents who are engaged in agriculture (United Nations, 1953).
These well-established relationships between fertility and socio-educational variables must nevertheless be qualified in at least three ways. First, at the highest socioeconomic levels, the negative correlation between family size and income tends to disappear or even to be reversed. Evidence on this point is provided by surveys conducted in several American and European cities (Riser and Whelpton, 1944, 1958; United Nations, 1953; Whelpton and Riser, 19461955). One hypothesis proposed to account for such findings is based upon the

84

possible role of upward social mobility in restricting family size (Westoff, 1953). Some indirect evidence for this hypothesis was provided by the finding that Philadelphians listed in both the 1940 Who's Who in America and the Social Register had larger families than those listed only in Who's Who in America (Baltzell, 1953). It was argued that the latter had more often achieved eminence through their own efforts rather than having enjoyed social prominence throughout their lives. They had thus shown more upward social mobility than the Social Register subgroup. Other analyses conducted within the same study, involving persons with a private school education and those whose families had been listed in Who's Who since 1900, likewise suggested greater fertility among the socially less mobile groups. A more recent survey of a random sample of men listed in the 1956-57 edition of Who's Who corroborates some of these earlier findings (Kirk, 1957). Attempts to test the social mobility hypothesis among intermediate socioeconomic groups, however, have yielded inconsistent results (Berent, 1952; Kiser and Whelpton, 1958). At such levels, it is difficult to identify persons for whom the drive for upward social mobility can be assumed to be negligible, even when objective evidence for such mobility is lacking.
A second major exception to the inverse relation between socioeconomic level and fertility is to be found in highfertility areas, where the crude birth rate is approximately 40 or more per thousand. Although demographic data from such areas are generally meager, when available they often reveal an absence of the expected fertility differentials. In Brazil, for example, socioeconomic differentials are slight and not in the expected direction. Thus within

85
each type of work, the fertility of employers and own-account workers tends to be higher than that of employees and unpaid family workers (United Nations, 1953).
The third and most important point pertains to the narrowing of fertility differentials following the postwar rise in birth rate. Surveys conducted both in the United States (U.S. Census Bureau, 1948, 1953) and in several European countries (Carter, 1953; United Nations, 1953) indicate that fertility increased more among those classes in which the prewar level had been lower, that is, among urban residents and persons in higher educational, vocational, and income levels. Some of the findings in a 1952 sample survey conducted by the U. S. Census Bureau illustrate these changes (U.S. Census Bureau, 1953). Thus income level showed no relation to number of children, except for a proportionately larger number of children at the lowest income level (under $1000). Moreover, professional, semiprofessional, and managerial groups had proportionately more children than did certain lower occupational groups, such as clerical and sales workers. Fertility differentials among educational levels had likewise decreased (U.S. Census Bureau, 1948), although the remaining differences among educational groups were still large, as were those between urban and rural dwellers. Also relevant are recent surveys of certain highly selected groups, including men listed in Who's Who in America (Kirk, 1957) and former scholarship holders among the graduates of a British grammar school (Hutton, 1953) . In both groups, the number of offspring suggests that the current replacement rate may be even higher than that of the general population.

It should be added, however, that the most recent sample surveys conducted by the U. S. Census Bureau indicate that the above qualification regarding fertility differentials must itself be qualified (U.S. Census Bureau, 1958). Although from 1950 to 1957 the over-all birth rate continued to rise, fertility differentials with regard to educational, occupational, and income level again widened. At the same time, there occurred a narrowing of the urban-rural differential in fertility.
INTELLIGENCE TEST PERFORMANCE
AND FAMILY SIZE
Turning now to investigations of the relation between intelligence test scores and family size, we must recognize at the outset that the problem is beset with methodological complications (Anastasi, 1956). Many of these difficulties center around sampling. Let me cite a few by way of illustration. Except for a few studies which will be separately reported, the relationship investigated was that between child's IQ and number of siblings, rather than that between parental intelligence and number of offspring. Such an approach fails to take into account the relative proportion of childless families and unmarried persons at different intellectual levels; nor does it consider differential mortality rates. Size of sibship is usually based on number of siblings alive at the time of the survey, rather than on total number of pregnancies, number of births, or number of children born alive. In two studies in which intelligence was correlated with both number of living sibs and total number of births in the same groups, the latter correlations were higher. Such a finding indicates that differential child mortality partly offsets differential fertility (Dawson, 1932; O'Hanlon, 1940).
Most studies have included a large

number of incomplete families of relatively young parents. Children from such incomplete families are of course classified as belonging to smaller families than will eventually be the case, a procedure which will tend to underestimate the relation between intelligence and family size. On the other hand, a negative correlation between intelligence and family size in a sample of incomplete families could simply reflect a tendency for the less intelligent parents to begin having children earlier; it need not follow that they would have larger completed families. A further complication is that younger parents in general are likely to be better educated than older parents surveyed at any one time, owing to the rising educational level of the population.
The most extensive analysis of the relation between intelligence and family size is to be found in the 1947 Scottish Survey (Scottish Council for Research in Education, 1949, 1953, 1958). In that year, a group intelligence test including verbal and pictorial content was administered to a nearly complete sample of 11-year-old children in Scotland. The correlation between test score and size of sibship was --.28. Within a random sample of 1215 children individually examined with the Stanford-Binet, the corresponding correlation was --.32. The mean Stanford-Binet IQ dropped steadily from 113 for "only" children to 91 for children with five siblings. The tendency for children from larger families to score lower persisted within each occupational class, a finding also reported by other investigators. Since fairly broad occupational categories were employed, however, it cannot be assumed that socioeconomic differences have been ruled out within single occupational levels.

Another large-scale investigation was conducted among 6-to-12-year-old French school children during the years 1943 and 1944 (Gille et al., 1954; Heuyer et al., 1950). This survey included approximately a two per cent sample of the elementary school population of France, chosen so as to yield a representative geographical distribution. AH subjects were given Ren6 Gille's "test Mosa'ique," a pictorial group test of intelligence. Mean scores again exhibited a consistent drop with increasing family size. This differential was apparent within each year group, the difference in mean score between a one-child family and a family of eight or more corresponding to 1 or 2 years of mental age. Within occupational groups, the negative relationship between intelligence and family size was clearly apparent among farmers, manual laborers, and clerical workers; it was barely discernible in the managerial group and negligible in the professional class.
Other similar surveys have been conducted on a less extensive scale in several countries. In England, there have been a number of attempts to test complete age samples of children within limited areas, such as a city or small rural region (Bradford, 1925; Burt, 1946; Cattell, 1936, 1937; Roberts, 1939; Roberts et al., 1938; Sutherland and Thomson, 1926). American investigations, although utilizing more heterogenous and less well-controlled samples, generally included adequate numbers of cases, ranging from several hundred to several thousand (Burks and Jones, 1935; Chapman and Wiggins, 1925; Damrin, 1949; Hirsch, 1930; Lentz, 1927). Those dealing largely with completed families report results closely similar to those of other studies. Mention may also be made of an investiga-

tion of Athens school children with a Greek adaptation of the StanfordBinet (Papavassiliou, 1954) and of two studies of German school children in which grades, scholastic retardation, and other academic indices provided the data on intelligence (Eydt, 1938; Heinen, 1938). All of these studies confirm the findings of the more extensive surveys regarding the decline in mean intelligence test score with increasing size of sibship. When correlations were computed between test score and family size, they were uniformly negative and clustered in the .20's and low .30's.
Studies of certain special groups have yielded similar results. In a survey of over 20,000 retarded children in the Massachusetts public schools, mean IQ declined from 73.2 for "only" children to 68.9 for those with 9 or more sibs (Dayton, 1935). In the California Gifted Child Study, Terman and his associates found a correlation of --.27 between IQ and size of sibship within 91 completed families (Terman et al., 1925). Although all families are now complete, information on number of sibs was not obtained in the later follow-ups of this group. Data on the relation between intelligence and number of offspring of the gifted subjects themselves, however, are available and will be analyzed and published in the near future.1
Of special interest are a few studies in which parental intelligence was correlated with number of offspring. An investigation on rural New England samples (Conrad and Jones, 1932) yielded low negative correlations between family size and parental intelligence test scores or educational level, only two of the correlations reaching significance. In completed families, moreover, all corre-

lations were positive and none significant. Insignificant correlations were likewise found in a California study of completed families (Willoughby, 1928).
In a third investigation (Willoughby and Coogan, 1940), 12-year follow-up data were gathered on 373 graduates of four Providence, Rhode Island, high schools. No relationship was found between high school intelligence test scores and age at marriage, age at birth of first child, or number of offspring at the time of the survey. It is also interesting to note that a low but significant negative correlation was found between intelligence and number of siblings of the subjects themselves. Moreover, subsequent education and occupational levels of the subjects revealed an inverse relation to number of offspring. Although this study is inconclusive because of the relatively small and selected sample and because of the incompleteness of the families, it nevertheless has the merit of providing a measure of parental intelligence prior to educational and vocational differentiation.
A more extensive longitudinal survey involved a 20-year follow-up of 300 engaged couples originally living in New England (Mishler et al, 1955; Westoff et al, 1957, 1958). Initial age of the group averaged about 25 years. The correlation between initial Otis Intelligence Test scores and eventual number of live births in a subgroup of 145 couples was .24 for women and .27 for men. These cases represent all couples living and married at the time of the follow-up, on whom sufficient information was available and who met certain additional requirements for inclusion in this analysis (Westoff et al., 1957, pp. 492-493). Both correlations are significant at the .01 level and indicate a slight tendency for the brighter parents to have larger

families. It is noteworthy that none of the studies in which parental intelligence was correlated with number of offspring has so far yielded the negative correlation ordinarily found when child intelligence is correlated with size of sibship.
ANALYSIS OF CAUSAL RELATIONS
In explaining the negative correlation between intelligence and size of sibship, three different etiological mechanisms should be considered. The actual causal relations may, of course, involve any combination of two or all three of these mechanisms. First, there may be inherited factors (neural, glandular, biochemical, etc.) which serve as constraints, reducing adaptability of behavior and limiting the sort of intellectual development measured by current intelligence tests. The less able parents would thus transmit their hereditary limitations to their offspring. The obtained correlations would then result from the fact that, within a given culture or subculture, persons with inferior heredity tended to have more offspring.
A second explanation attributes individual differences in children's abilities to psychological differences in the environments provided by parents of varying intellectual levels. In this case, the correlation between family size and intelligence of offspring would again result from a tendency for the less intelligent parents to have more children, but heredity would not be involved. Differences in intellectual level among the parents, as well as among the offspring, would have resulted from environmental factors.
A third possible interpretation is based upon family size itself as a causal factor. A larger family, for example, usually means a reduction in per capita funds available for education, recreation,

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:25 08 December 2015

housing, food, medical attention, and other environmental requisites. From a psychological viewpoint, a significant factor is the degree of adult contact provided in families of different sizes. Available evidence indicates that such contact may be one of the most important single factors in language development, which in turn plays a major part in both educational progress and intelligence test performance. Whatever the specific factors involved, the etiological mechanism under consideration is independent of the intellectual level of the parents.
On the basis of existing data, it is impossible to choose among these explanations or to determine the relative contribution of the three types of influences. Certain lines of investigation do nevertheless throw some light on causal relations. Among them may be mentioned the previously cited studies on parental intelligence and number of offspring, as well as research on the role of language in the relation between sibship size and intelligence (Nisbet, 1953a, 1953b; Scott and Nisbet, 1955) and studies on families artificially limited by death of the father (Sutherland, 1930). Taken together, these investigations suggest that no one hypothesis is sufficient to account for all the observed correlation between intelligence and family size. But further than that it would be hazardous to go.
EUGENIC IMPLICATIONS
Regardless of which causal mechanism is involved, a negative correlation between intelligence and family size could lead to a decline in intelligence in successive generations. Between 1930 and 1950, a number of demographic writers predicted such a decline, with varying degrees of foreboding. Subsequent follow-ups, however, have revealed a rise in

89
mean intelligence, rather than the predicted decline. Evidence for such a rise is to be found in the 1932 and 1947 surveys of 11-year-old Scottish children (Scottish Council for Research in Education, 1949), in a comparison of the intelligence test performance of the United States Army in the two World Wars (Tuddenham, 1948), and in an analysis of the test scores of American high school students over a twenty-year period (Finch, 1946). Other studies conducted on a smaller scale obtained essentially corroborative results (cf. Anastasi, 1958, pp. 209-211).
One explanation offered for the observed rise in intelligence test performance is the increasing test sophistication of the population, which would effect an improvement in test-taking abilities with no accompanying rise in general level of intellectual functioning. In the Scottish Survey, it was estimated that no more than 25 per cent of the rise in score could be attributed to this source (Scottish Council for Research in Education, 1958, pp. 39-47). Improvement in educational and other cultural facilities, together with the rising educational level of the general population, represents a second type of influence, of much broader scope than test sophistication. From a purely genetic point of view, it has been demonstrated that a low negative correlation between intelligence and family size is not inconsistent with a rising intellectual level (Penrose, 1948, 1950a, 1950b; Willoughby and Goodrie, 1927). This follows from such conditions as the infertility of low-grade mental defectives, assortative mating, and the size of the parent-child correlation in intelligence. In conclusion, let me emphasize that whether we wish to establish the exact relation between intelligence and fertility, analyze its causes, or

But it is
