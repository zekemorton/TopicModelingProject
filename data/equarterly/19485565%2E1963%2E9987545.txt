EXCESS AND UNWANTED FERTILITY*
FREDERICK OSBORN

Downloaded by [University of Michigan] at 13:27 08 December 2015

INTRODUCTION
Around 1800, when Thomas Jefferson was about to become President of the United States, the population was close to 5 million. The crude birth rate was approximately 55 per thousand of population (U. S. Bureau of Census, 1960) as compared to 22.5 per thousand today (U. S. Dept. HEW, 1962); figures are based on white population only, no nonwhite being available. The excess of births over deaths was sufficient to double the population every 28 years (Grabill, Riser, and Whelpton, 1958). Then there was no question of too many people. A whole continent lay waiting to be settled.
In 1907, when the last public land was opened for settlement, the population totalled 87 million. It was still increasing, but the free land was gone. It was the end of an epoch.
Today, in 1963, there are over 190 million people in the continental United States. We have been able to meet their physical needs by marvelous technical advances in agriculture and industry. But we are clustered in dense masses along the eastern and western seaboards; we have not met the problems of the great metropolis, and we are hard put to maintain the quality of our schools and colleges. Many doubt that our political institutions are flexible enough to cope with such rapid growth.

that, even if birth rates level off, the country is headed for a population of about 240 million by 1980 and may well reach 300 million by the year 2000. There is no evidence to indicate that such rapid growth would increase the comfort, the enjoyment, or the dignity of life of the people of the United States. Thoughtful people deplore this speed of growth, but most suggestions for slowing it down are opposed by American traditions.
Today's rate of growth is uneven. The highest birth rates are still found among couples who are at both a low economic level and a low level of education. Their large families help perpeuate this condition. Their homes provide a minimum of stimulus to their children and have a retarding effect on efforts to improve the level of education at a time when our educational resources are already strained by a Mood of numbers. Their children grow up to be like their parents and thus repeat the harmful cycle. No way has in the past been found to break this chain of events without offending the self-respect of the individual and the right of people to choose for themselves the number of children they should have.
Recent demographic studies have for the first time given detailed attention to the personal desires of American married couples as to the size of their families. This line of inquiry seems a fruitful one. It suggests some valuable indices for use in estimating future growth, and it points to the possibility of solutions to our major population problems.

Using material chiefly from recent studies, we will be concerned in this paper with the attempts of married people in this country to meet their own problems as to size of family and with the social significance of their solutions.
CHANGES IN SIZE OF FAMILY
With the movement of people from rural to urban areas which has been going on for the past 100 years, children have become far less of an economic asset. They go to work later, and they seldom plan to support their parents in their old age. At the same time, the rearing of children has become more difficult and expensive, and their period of education has been much extended.
The response of married couples in this country, and in other countries where the circumstances have been the same, has been to reduce the size of their families by using some form of fertility control. It is thought that in colonial days the average number of live births per married woman may have been as high as 8. It was still 6 or 7 in 1800. For ever-married women aged 45 to 49, the average number of births had declined by 1910 to 4.7, and 467O of these births had been in families of five or more children (Freedman, Whelpton, and Campbell, 1959).
The decline reached bottom with the cohort of women born in 1906-1910, most of whose early reproductive life was spent in the depression. Their average size of family was 2.27 below the number needed for replacement at that time (Freedman et al., 1959). Only 14% had five children or more (Table 1).
From the low of 2.27 there was an upturn accompanying and probably due to the prosperity of the war and postwar years, a making up for delayed marriages and births and a more favorable psycho-

logical attitude towards family building. The rise seemingly reached its peak with the cohort of women born in 1931-35, with an estimated 2.9 children on completion of childbearing, a figure not equalled since the cohort of 1891-95 forty years before. In cohorts after that of 1931-35, there are indications of a slight decline (Freedman et al., 1959).
Thus, by sound instinct and with a proper sense of responsibility to themselves and to their children, the married couples of this country have for the greater part of the past 150 years progressively lowered the size of their families, though until recently they had neither the sanction of society nor that of the church. Yet, in having smaller families they have rendered society a great servvice. If it had not been for the reduction of births, our country would have bogged down, swamped by the rapid growth of its population. Even today, there are over twice as many births as deaths, an excess compounded by the present age distribution of the population. Wemay well inquire whether our people are likely to make further reductions in the number of their children and, if so, how great these will be and how soon they will come.
Our inquiry will be based chiefly on

material from two major studies: that by Westoff, Potter, Sagi, and Mishler, the so-called "Princeton Study"; and that by Freedman, Whelpton, and Campbell, generally spoken of as the "Growth of American Families Study" or "G.A.F. Study."
The Princeton study was based on interviews held in the spring of 1957 with 1,165 women in metropolitan and suburban areas who had borne a second child in September 1956, 5 to 7 months before the interview. Both spouses were white, born in the United States, and once married. For reasons of cost and for technical reasons related to size of sample, the study included only couples in metropolitan areas. Replies from rural areas would undoubtedly have been different. But the urbanization of the country is taking place rapidly now, both by the movement to urban areas and by the urbanization of rural cultures. The attitudes of parents in the metropolitan areas are probably the best guide to future trends.
The G.A.F. study was based on interviews held in 1955 with 2,713 white women between the ages of 18 and 39, married and living with their husbands, or separated only temporarily by service in the army. These wives were selected in such a way as to constitute a scientific probability sample of the approximately 17 million wives in our national popula-

tion having the indicated characteristics in March 1955.
Neither study included the nonwhite population. White births make up a major proportion of all births (about 86% in 1950-54), but the fertility characteristics of the nonwhite population may be quite different from those of whites. In the absence of factual information, we can only assume that at similar educational and economic levels the difference is not large.
NUMBER OF CHILDREN WANTED AND
DEDUCTIONS FOR SUBFECUNDITY
In the Princeton study of women who already had two children, the number of children desired by wives and husbands ranged from 2.7 for the "bluecollar" Jews to 3.8 for the "white-collar" Catholics, with the Protestants taking a middle position at 3, and 2.9 for the "white-collar" and "blue-collar" groups, respectively (Table 2). The average for all couples was 3.2 (Westoff et al., 1961). Almost two-thirds wanted either 3 or 4 children, and 13% wanted 5 or more (Table 3).
Women who already have two children are likely to have better knowledge of how many children they want than women who express their opinions earlier; women with 2 children, as they get older, may decide on somewhat smaller families. This appears to be especially the case among white-collar Catholics.

Thus, the average of 3.2 is undoubtedly on the high side. In any events, the figure of 3.2 must be reduced to take account of the subfecundity which is to be expected even among those 2-child women. In the Indianapolis study it is reported that only 88.4% of those able to have a second child could have had a third; of those having a third child, only 90% could have had a fourth; and of these, 90%could have a fifth, and soon (Whelpton and Kiser, editors, 1961). Taking into account the third, fourth, fifth, and later children necessary to make up the total, the minimum reduction for subfecundity after thesecond child would be around 20%. Reducing the average number of children wanted, 3.2, by 20% of the amount in excess of 2 children (i.e., 20% x 1.2), we get the figure 2.96 as the number of children these women with 2 children want and are able to have. For this figure to be applicable to all women, it must be further reduced to take account of women who do not marry, are childless, or have only one child. The proportion of unmarried, childless, or one-child women has been changing rapidly in recent years. The lowestfigure is that for thecohort of women reaching age 35-39 in 1960. This group has reached the lowest point in childlessness and the lowest point in one-child fami-

lies of any previous cohort, reflecting the great effect of the baby boom after World War II. Of all American women age 35-39 in 1960(including the unmarried), 12%were childless, and 15% had only one child. By the end of childbearing, this cohort may be down to11% childless and 15% one-child, leaving 74% with 2 or more children. Multiplying 2.96 (the average number of children that women with two children want and are able to have) by this 74%,andadding the 15% one-child women, (2.96X 74 + .15), we get 2.34 as the average size of family if women had the number of children they wanted and were able to have.
A somewhat different figure is derived from the material in the G.A.F. study. The average number of children wanted by the wives at time of interview was 3.07, which compares with the 3.2 children wanted by thewives with 2 children in the Princeton study. The lower figure in the G.A.F. study is probably due to the inclusion in this study of older women and the exclusion in the Princeton study of women with less than 2 children, many of whom undoubtedly wanted less than 2 children. The wives interviewed in the G.A.F. study included the definitely sterile who wanted on an average 3.62 children, a number they would obviously not be able to attain (Table 4). If the definitely sterile are excluded, the average number of children wanted at interview is reduced to 3.01 (Freedman et al., 1959). Two further reductions must be made in the figure of 3.01 children wanted, one for subfecundity and one for the proportion of unmarried women.
In the G.A.F. study, it is reported that in marriages of 10-14 years' duration the average number of children with contra-

ception and no observed subfecundity was 2.98; with observed subfecundity it was only 85% of that figure, which gives 2.53 as the average size of family wanted and attainable by married women (Freedman et al., 1959). Taking into account the 6% unmarried women, we get 2.38 as the average size of family wanted and attainable for all women.
NUMBER OF CHILDREN REPORTED UNWANTED
The first extensive source o£ information on excess and unwanted fertility is found in the G.A.F. study.
For the purposes of this study, the couples were classified into a number of groups as fecund, subfecund, sterile; as users (of contraception), or nonusers; and pregnancies were classified as completely planned, partially planned, excess fertility, or not ascertained. Our interest lies in the classification "excess fertility." Since the couples studied represent a sample of the entire national population, we may assume that the proportions in the classifications fecund, subfecund, sterile, users, and nonusers are the same as those of the white population in the country as a whole, and that the excess fertility of the group is not very different from that of the country as a whole. The definitions of fertility are as follows (Freedman et al., 1959):
Completely planned fertility: the couple used contraception regularly and conceived only when they stopped it for that purpose. Such couples have had no accidental or other unplanned pregnancies. Obviously their pregnancies were "wanted" pregnancies. Partially planned fertility: fertility was planned for all these couples in the sense that they have not had more pregnancies than they wanted. Some pregnancies occurred long before they were wanted, but every pregnancy was

wanted sooner or later. Excess fertility: the couple's most recent pregnancy was unwanted then or later by the wife, the husband, or both. (The question asked was "Before your last pregnancy began did you really want another child at some time in the future, or would you just as soon not have had one?") (Freedman et al., 1959).
Sixteen per cent of the most recent pregnancies were reported as not wanted by the wife, the husband, or both (Freedman et al., 1959). Excess fertility increased rapidly with size of family, being only 6% for the first child and going on up to 56% for the sixth or later children. The biggest break is between two and three children, when the percentage of "completely planned" goes down from 18 to 9, and the percentage of unplanned pregnancies goes up from 8 to 19, rising rapidly thereafter with each increase in family size to 56% when the last child was sixth or later (Table 5).
The proportion of unwanted pregnancies reported by the women in the study cannot be used directly to find the number of unwanted pregnancies in any given year. These women, aged 19 to 39, were reporting on their last pregnancy,

which in many cases must have been many years before. There is an accumulation of one-child couples who had stopped there, not wanting another child, and an accumulation of two-child couples, and so on. Thus, they are less likely to produce another child than women with the same number of children whose last child was born in a given calendar year.
One can, however, proceed by relating the proportions of unwanted births by parity to "all births" reported by the women in this sample instead of to their "most recent" births. For example, of the 603 first births to one parity couples, 36 or 6% were unwanted. If this number is related to the 2,294 first births reported in the study, we get an estimated 1.6% unwanted first births. Applying these proportions to 1960 births by parities, we get 9.6% unwanted births (Table 6).
But this assumes that all two-child women wanted their first child, all threechild women wanted their first and second children, and so on, which is obviously not the case. The authors of the study estimate, from their 1960 data, that the average excess for couples with any excess is about 1.3 children, or even as high as 1.5 children. Applying those es-

timates to the figure of 9.6 unwanted, we get, respectively, 12.5% unwanted, or 14.4% unwanted.
There is a third method, probably more accurate than either of the other two. The experience of women 35-39 in 1955, which combines their experience at each age, is far more representative of the experience of women of different ages in a given year. Figures for women 35-39 in 1955 are available in the G.A.F. study, though, unfortunately, the sample is small.
Using the reports of the women 35-39 by parities and applying them to births by parities for all women in 1960, we get a figure of 8.3% unwanted births in 1960. Multiplying this by 1.5, we get 12.5. The higher figure, 1.5, is apparently the best one to apply to the 35-39 year age group (Table 7).
We have, then, three different figures for the proportion of unwanted births among white couples in 1960: 12.5, 14.4, and 12.5 again. Each of these figures is derived from reports of women who in many cases were looking back to births a number of years ago. It is likely that errors in their recollection of their attitudes would tend to be on the side of reporting pregnancies as wanted when

Excess and Unwanted Fertility

at the time they were actually not wanted. The correction of this type of error would raise the estimate, perhaps considerably. We have no means of knowing how much.
There is another limitation in these estimates, but one which is subject to a reasonable correction. The women in the study were all white, married, and living with their husbands. The women whose births were recorded by parities for 1960 included all women, married, divorced, and unmarried white and nonwhite. Five percent of their births, a total of 224,300, were illegitimate (U. S. Dept. HEW, 1960) and certainly a far larger proportion of illegitimate births are unwanted than of legitimate births. Probably three-quarters, or 168,225, were not wanted. This would be 4.1% of total births reduced to 3.7% because of the number already deducted by parities. Over 12% of 1960 births were to nonwhites, of which some 78% were legitimate, and if nonwhites follow the same pattern of attitudes as whites at corresponding economic and educational levels, the average number of unwanted births for nonwhites, who average lower economic and educational levels, would be almost double that of whites. This would add another 1% to the proportion of unwanted.
Taking these two factors together, the estimates for unwanted births should be increased by another 5% of all births. This would raise the percent unwanted according to the three estimates to 17.5%, 19.4%, and 17.2%, respectively.
Whelpton has estimated that when the women of childbearing age in 1960 have completed their families there will have been an average of 2.87 children for all women (Freedman et al., 1959). If we deduct from this figure the proportions of

unwanted children indicated in our three different estimates, we get as size of completed family for all women:
Estimate

No. children per woman, 1960 % Unwanted

2.87 2.87 2.87 --17.5 --19.4 --17.2

No. wanted children per woman

2.37 2.31 2.38

These estimates may be high because they have not been corrected for the probable under-reporting of women questioned some years after their last pregnancy. We may take the estimate of 2.37 as perhaps the most accurate.

CONCLUSIONS ON NUMBER OF

WANTED CHILDREN

From the Princeton and G.A.F. studies

we have derived three estimates of num-

ber of children per woman if American

women had the number of children they

want (after necessary deductions for sub-

fecundity).

The first estimate was based on

the number of children wanted by

married women with two children

(Princeton Study. The figure was 2.34.

The second estimate was based on

the number of children wanted by

a national sample of married

women aged 19-39 (G.A.F. Study).

The figure was

2.39.

The third estimate was the mid-

dle of three figures obtained by

using the data for unwanted chil-

dren in the G.A.F. Study. The

figure was

2.37.

The third estimate, based on unwant-

ed pregnancies, may be high because no

correction has been made for the tend-

ency of women to forget, after their child

is born, that the pregnancy was not

wanted.

It must be kept in mind that the number of children wanted by American women may vary with changes in conditions. In a study by the American Institute of Public Opinion in 1941, the "ideal" size of family was specified as 3 children, and in 1955 ideal size was specified as 3.4 children. The "most popular" ideal number rose from 2 children in 1941 to 4 children in 1955. Twentyone per cent gave 4 children as their ideal in 1941, and 41% gave 4 children as their ideal in 1955 (Freedman et al., 1959).
At present rates of mortality, size of family required for replacement is approximately 2.17 (Coale, 1963). Our estimates are about 10% above this figure, a difference which might easily be accounted for if illegitimate births were taken into account, or by the bias we have previously noted, or by some slight change in popular ideals as to size of family.
THE INCREASING USE AND EFFECTIVENESS OF BIRTH CONTROL
In the papers of the Royal Commission on Population, it is reported that, among English women interviewed in 1946 who had married before age 45, only 15% of those who were married before 1910 had used a method of family limitation some time during their married life as against 40% of those married from 1910 to 1919, 58% of those married 1920-24, 61% of those married 1925-29, 63% of those married 1930-34, and 66% of those married 1935-39 (Table 9).
Comparable figures for the United States are not available. In the G.A.F. study of 1955, 70% of this national sample of women aged 18-39 reported the use of methods to prevent conception, but among the fecund older couples, 92% had used contraception after 10 or

more years of marriage (Freedman et al., 1959). This latter figure compares with the figure for the Indianapolis study of 1941 which found that 89% of the white Protestant urban couples married 12 to 15 years used contraception.
The Princeton study of women who in 1957 had had two children showed a great increase in the use of contraception after the first birth and wide variations by religion and by occupation. Only 1% of the white-collar Jewish group were still not using contraception after the second birth, but 22% of the white-collar Catholic couples were still not using contraception after the second birth (Table 10).
The most important variations in the use of contraception are those influenced by amount of education. The G.A.F. study shows 92% of the college couples as past or future users and only 69% of the grade school couples as past or future users (Table 11). This variation in the use of birth control is just about enough to account for the difference in the proportion of unwanted children shown in the same study, as previously noted -- 7% unwanted last pregnancies when both husband and wife went to college and 33% when both husband and wife went only to grade school (Table 8).
By all present indications, we must expect that the spread of contraceptive practice which has been going on for the past hundred years is going to continue, and, equally or more important, we can expect that its use will become more effective even among the least educated of our people, because new and more effective methods are being rapidly developed. Bogue's studies in Chicago show an enthusiastic and effective use of steroid pills among the least educated and lowest income groups in that city.

We would not be permitting ourselves too great a flight of the imagination if we calculated the period of time it would take for contraception to be so widely and effectively used in the United States that American women would have no more children than they desire or are able to have.
I will not attempt such a calculation myself, leaving it to more qualified people, but my guess would be that the rate of change in both use and effectiveness is cumulative and will proceed from now on with great rapidity. It will be hastened by the decrease in the proportion of our people at the lower levels of education and by the now imminent development of cheap and effective means of physiological control of fertility. It can, and probably will, be hastened by a more intelligent attitude towards birth control by our public authorities and more effective educational campaigns. It may be affected by a change in fashions and by less prosperous times.
The change to a reduced birth rate and a negligible number of unwanted children may take place fast enough to bring the rate down near to the replacement level in the next 10 or 15 years.
If the women of the United States brought their reproduction down to the

rate required simply for the replacement of the population in the next generation, it would not mean an immediate cessation of growth. Because of our present age distribution, our population would keep increasing in numbers for a couple of generations, and only very gradually would it reach a point of equilibrium.
The Princeton Office of Population Research has given us a calculation of rates of growth if mortality remains as at present and average size of family declines evenly over the next ten years to a point in December 1972 when size of family is sufficient only for replacement and thereafter remains at the replacement level. According to this calculation, the population would be approximately stabilized about the end of 2022 and our people would then number about 300 million (Coale, 1963).

THE EFFECT ON POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS OF THE EXPECTED DECLINE IN BIRTHS
The decline in births which had been going on in this country for the past 150 years was halted after the war by a sudden rise in the number of births, mostly to women in the white-collar groups. This rise seems now to have run its course, as indicated by its leveling off around 1957 and declining a little each

year thereafter through 1962. There is little reason to believe that the rise in white-collar births will be resumed. Meantime, the birth rate among the couples at the grade-school level will continue its long decline as birth control methods become more effective. A serious decline in white-collar births is, of course, a possibility; a continuing decline in grade-school births seems almost a certainty.
If we make the assumption that the decline at each educational level will be in proportion to the number of unwanted births for that group estimated for 1955, we will find the birth rate of gradeschool couples decreasing by 24% (Freedman et al., 1959). Taking the 1950 census figures for number of children born to 1,000 white urban women by education of wife and deducting the percentage of unwanted children for each educational class, we find that class differences would be very much reduced; grade-school women in 1950 had 49% more births than college women but would have had only 22% more if both

groups eliminated excess of fertility (Table 12).
The evidence on "unwanted" children by education of the mother receives confirmation from the answers to a question asked in the Princeton study. When asked the number of children they desired, the wives of blue-collar workers expressed a desire for fewer children than did the wives of white-collar workers (Westoff et al., 1961). The differences were small but consistent in each of the religious groups. Among the Protestant wives with white-collar fathers, the white-collar group wanted 3.1 children and the blue-collar wives wanted 3.0 children. Among the Catholics and mixed Catholics, the white-collar wives with white-collar fathers wanted 4.0 children and the blue-collar wives wanted 3.5 children. The same differences were found among wives with blue-collar fathers. It is not the desire for more children which in the past has given gradeschool mothers the higher birth rate but their less frequent and less effective use of birth control. We have already noted

(Table 11) that, for all wives, 90%, of those with a college education were past or future users of contraception, but only 72% of grade school wives were.
Education is not only important for itself but also for its effect on the next generation. Children in general are apt to follow the educational level of their parents, and even when the children of less educated parents receive more years of education, the probability is that their home environment will not have given them the stimulus needed for taking full advantage of the educational opportunities offered. A reduced proportion of children born to the least educated parents would make for a permanent improvement in the educational level of the country as a whole.
Economic level is of itself a considerable factor in determining proportion of unwanted children. Total excess fertility for women in the G.A.F. study was lowest with husbands' income at $6,000 or more and rose steadily with each drop in income. No figures are given for excess fertility by both education and income, but for contraception, figures available show 79% of college wives using contraception when husbands' income is $6,000 or more, and only 29% of grade-school wives using contraception when husbands' income was under $3,000 (Freedman et al., 1959). The conclusions for excess children are inescapable.
Over half of all families with 5 or 6 or more children have one or more unwanted children (Table 6). A large proportion of these couples, especially in the considerable group with 6 or more children, are at a low economic and educational level and cannot give their children normal educational opportunities. Their rate of growth is the highest in the country. They constitute a major

part of that submerged segment of our population who find it almost impossible to rise out of the mire of poverty. The size of their families is one of the factors that hold them down.

CONCLUSIONS
Analysis of the Princeton and G.A.F. studies with reasonable adjustments for elements omitted in their data suggests that American women are having almost 20% more children than they would have if they had only pregnancies wanted at the time or at a later date. These excess births are the result of failure to use contraception or failure to use it effectively.
A reduction of births to the number wanted by the parents would bring the birth rate close to replacement and would slow the rate of population growth. If a reduction of the rate neded for replacement were attained within 10 years, our population would grow to reach about 300 million in the year 2020 and be about stationary thereafter. We would have more time to adjust our political, educational, and social institutions to our great growth in size and to the urbanization of our people. There would be less pressure on our natural resources and less danger of ultimate overpopulation.
The reduction would be greatest among those at the lowest educational

level. The effort to improve the educational level of our people would be freed of the retarding effect of too many children from homes providing inadequate stimulus or motivation for their development.
The reduction would also be greatest among the large families at the lowest economic levels. Freed from the burden of unwanted children, much of the badly housed, badly fed, badly educated portion of our people would have new hope for pulling themselves out of their present environment.
Finally, if all couples were entirely free to decide how many children they were able and willing to care for andhad no more than that number, the proportion of neglected children would be greatly reduced at all levels of income and education, to the great benefit of the children and of society.
American men and women have been moving steadily in the direction of these changes for the past hundred years, but they have still quite a way to go, and time is running out. Death rates have been so reduced that our rate or growth is too rapid in view of present numbers. Modern life has less room for the uneducated in contrast to the need for manual labor only a generation ago; unwanted children suffered little neglect on the farm compared to the bringing-up they get in the city.
Under present conditions it is surpiising that birth control is still opposed in many quarters; that contraceptive advice is not available in most hospitals and hospital clinics; that many, perhaps most, public health people all over the world still think that their work in reducing deaths is unrelated to the corresponding need for reducing births; and that many welfare workers still think it more im-

portant to help women have more children than to help make them able todecide for themselves how many children they should have.
We conclude that the rate at which contraception is spreading and the rate at which contraceptive methods are becoming more effective provide indices for the student of population which must be taken into account in projecting the growth and characteristics of the population.
