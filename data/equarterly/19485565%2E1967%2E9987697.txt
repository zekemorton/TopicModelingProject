I. RELATION BETWEEN THE AGE AT MARRIAGE AND FERTILITY
1.1. Relation between the Age at Marriage and Completed Family Size
Relation between age at marriage and completed size of family has been studied by many demographers, but no consistent relationship has been demonstrated (Sinha, 1952; Smith, 1960; Tuan, 1958). Although the average numbers of children ever-born generally decrease with rise in age at marriage, sometimes females marrying below 16 years of age have been found to have fewer children ever-born than those marrying at ages 16 to 18 years. It has been said that the females under 16 years may not have been physiologically fully developed to carry their pregnancies to a successful end, and quite often their pregnancies may terminate in early or late foetal deaths, thus impairing their future reproductive capacity. However, with regard to studies made in various parts of India, a broad generalization could be made that women marrying later than 19 years of age had approximately one child less than those marrying between the ages of 15 and 19 years. For example, in The Mysore Study, it was found that females marrying between 14 and 17 years gave birth to 5.9 children, while those marrying between 18 and 21 years eventually gave birth to only 4.7 children (United Nations, 1961).
 K. G. Basavarajappa is Demographer at the Department of Demography, The Australian National University, Canberra. M. I. Belvalgidad is Statistician in the Department of Preventive and Social Medicine of the Lady Hardinge Medical College, New Delhi.

In many other studies in various parts of India, differences in the average number of children ever-born, between those age groups, ranged from 0.5 to 1.0 or more. The same findings were corroborated by the data collected at the Office of the Registrar General of India (Jain, 1964).
These have led many people to advocate raising the minimum age at marriage of females as a means of reducing fertility in India. The Times of India, an influential English daily from Bombay, recently wrote an editorial asking the Government of India to consider legislation to raise the minimum age at marriage to 19 and 21 years from the present 15 and 18 years for females and males respectively.1
1.2. Relation between the Age at Marriage and the Birth Rate
The existence of the relationship between the age at marriage and the completed size of family mentioned in Section 1.1 above, ,has prompted many demographers to examine the effect of postponement of marriage on the birth rate. By using stable population models, Coale and Tye (1961) have demonstrated that postponement of marriage can contribute substantially to reduction in the birth rates and the population growth,
1 Sarda Act of British India in 1929 prescribed the minimum ages at marriage of 14 and 18 years for females and males, respectively. The Hindu marriage Act of 1955 raised the minimum age at marriage of females to 15 years. Though these Acts fix the minimum ages at marriage for females and males in India, many factors have come in the way of their effective implementation, and for all practical purposes, they remain unimplemented (Nevett, 1964).

even when completed size of family is no/ reduced, and that this contribution is potentially greatest in those countries which have the highest fertility and low average age of marriage. Hence, theysuggest that postponement must be given serious consideration as a powerful supplementary component of population policy in pre-industrial societies in the crucial decades ahead.
William Leasure has shown that for Bolivian marriage pattern, when the singulate mean age at marriage changes from 22.5 years to 27.2 years, the birth rate declines from 41 to 30, i.e., by about 27%. For marriage pattern of Turkey, when the singulate mean age at marriage changes from 19.7years to 27.2years, the birth rate declines from 50 to 33 or by about 34% (Leasure, 1963).
In many studies on the Indian birth rate, when the female age at marriage is raised to 19 to 20 years, reductions ranging from 16% to 50%have been claimed (Agarwala, 1964, 1965; Goyal, 1964; Zachariah and Talwar, 1964). Agarwala states that if the proportions currently married in India change to those obtained in Kerala corresponding to the marriage age of 19 to 20 years, the reduction in birth rate would be of the order of 29%.
Table 1presents the information available on the average ages of females at marriage and on the birth rates of selected States in India. These states are selected because of their generally higher ages at marriage than other states. Because of nonavailability of reliable registered birth rates for India and the states, the estimated birth rates from two sources are presented. Except for Assam where the birth rates from these two sources differ by 10 points, those for other states are consistent. The lower rate for Assam from National Sample Survey seems to be due to underreport-

ing of births in the survey. In fact the birth rate increased from 35.2 in the first subround2 to 47.2 in the sixth or final subround giving an average of 39.1 for all subrounds (India, Government of, Cabinet Secretariat, 1961) for Assam.
It may be seen that the birth rate for Kerala for the period 1951-1961, obtained by the Census Actuary was only 6.7% lower than that for the rest of India during the same period. Hence, it is evident that the information available on the birth rate for different regions in India having different average ages at marriage do not support the view that reductions could be as much as

those claimed by Agarwala and other authors.
Also, these analyses do not show how postponements of marriage which lead to changes in proportions married in various ages and in age composition, at least during the transition period, affect the birth rate. Neither do they tell us the consequences of the establishment of the new stable marriage pattern. In India where marriage is almost universal, when a large number of females under 20 years of age are prevented from marrying, some of the males previously marrying these females may find brides from other age groups, thus causing possible increases in proportions married at ages 20 and above. No account has been taken of this factor in any of the above analyses.
1.3. The Present Analysis
The average age at marriage of females in India has been rising slowly from about 13 years in 1901-1911 to about 15.6 years in 1951-1961. If this were to change to a higher average age, say 20, it should be noted that there is no unique pattern of marriage corresponding to this average. For example, all women who marry could marry at age 20 for an average age at marriage of 20 years; or some could marry earlier and some later in a host of patterns, and the average age would remain constant at age 20 years. Hence, to avoid this multiplicity of patterns, it is assumed in this study that from a specified point of time, say 1961, no female under 20 years of age marries. Thus, the effect on the birth rate is examined when the minimum age at marriage is raised to 20 years or when the average age at marriage is slightly higher than 20 years.
Because a large number of younger females would be prevented from marry-

ing when the minimum age is raised to 20 years, it was assumed that some males previously marrying these females might find brides from other higher ages. Hence, to allow for the marriage of some of these males previously marrying females under 20 years, it is assumed that increased proportions of females marry at ages 20 to 39 years. Under these assumptions, starting from the year 1961, the females of various marital status categories were projected at intervals of 5 years by using constant schedules of mortality and marital fertility rates. The birth rate at intervals of 5 years was then obtained by applying a set of age-specific marital fertility rates to these projected distributions, and the changes in it were studied.
It may be pointed out that when the attitude of the community changes in favour of higher age at marriage it might change with regard to various other social and economic factors which generally favor lower fertility. However, it is not intended here to study the effect of changes in social and economic factors, such as increased use of contraceptives, etc., on the birth rate. It is intended to provide specifically an estimate of decline in the birth rate when--
i. the minimum age at marriage of females is raised to 20 years
ii. the present universality of marriage is retained
iii. the schedules of mortality and marital fertility rates remain constant
iv. the widow remarriages, divorces, and migration are insignificant, and
v. there are no differences in mortality according to marital status.
The implications of these assumptions are discussed in Section 3.5. For the sake of convenience, the analysis is done only with respect to females, but the method is applicable to males. The de-

tails of the method are given in Parts II and III.
II. METHOD OF OBTAINING CHANGES IN
THE BIRTH RATE
2. The Marital Status Distribution
The marital status distribution for females of India for the year 1961 is presented in Table 2. It may be seen that because of inaccurate reporting of ages at the census, the totals of all marital status categories by ages are somewhat irregular and do not follow the expected pattern. These irregularities had to be corrected before using the 1961 census marital status distribution for purposes of projection. The method used for correcting is as follows:
i. Small numbers of females of unknown ages and of unknown marital status were proportionately distributed.
ii. For each age group, the proportions single, married, and "others" (i.e., widowed and/or divorced) were then computed,
iii. These proportions were applied to the smoothed five-year age totals of census of India 1961 (India, Government of, Ministry of Home Affairs, 1963), and the numbers

corresponding to expectation of life equal to 47.5 years were taken from the United Nations Model Life Tables (United Nations, 1956). For purposes of projection, mortality was assumed to remain constant and it was also assumed that there were no differences in mortality by marital status. First, the method of projecting the females of ages 5 to 9, 10 to 14, etc., and of each marital status category will be described. The projection of females of ages 0 to 4 years will be described separately.
(a) Projection of Females of Ages 5 to 9, 10 to 14, etc. Applying appropriate survival ratios to the number of females of each marital status category, the numbers surviving after five years were obtained. Thus, if 6N*a refers to the single females in the five-year age group x to x+4 in year t, then the number of single females surviving to age group x+5 to x+9 in year t+5 is given by
5 i v I + 5 -- 5 1 V « Tf
where 6Z/a refers to years of life lived by the female life table population in the five-year age group x to x+4.
In this way, the single female populations in age groups 5 to 9, 10 to 14 etc., after five years from the base year were estimated. Similarly, the survivors of "others" in age groups 5 to 9, 10 to 14 etc., after five years were estimated.
For projecting the female population surviving married, joint survival ratios were used. For this purpose, it was assumed that on an average females marry husbands five years older than them and hence the difference between the ages of husbands and wives was taken as five years. This difference of five years was taken because it was approximately equal to the difference in the average age at marriage of males and females observed

in India (Agarwala, 1957), and also because it facilitates computation.
Thus, if SM*W refers to the number of married females in the five-year age group x to x+4 in year t, the number surviving as married to age group x+5 to x + 9 in year t+5 is given by
Tf Jm
ft
and those becoming widowed and surviving to age group x+5 to x+9 by
1i
where sLmg, refers to years of life lived by the male life table population in the age group x to x+4 and sWt4 t o t^e number of married females of ages x to x+4 becoming widowed during t to t+5 and surviving to age group x+ 5 to x+9 etc. The numbers of widows in each age group thus obtained were then added to "others" in the corresponding age groups obtained as explained in the preceding paragraph.
By this method, females in the age groups 5 to 9, 10 to 14 etc. of all three categories of marital status were projected from year t to t+5. The distribution thus obtained was termed as the "intermediate marital status distribution" for the year t+5, and the final marital status distribution for the same year was estimated from this as explained below.
As pointed out in Section 1.3, it was assumed that from 1961 no female below the age of 20 marries. Hence, to compensate partly for these marriages, increased proportions of females were assumed to marry at ages 20 to 39 years. Consequently, it was assumed that the proportions never married at ages 20 to 39 after 1961 would be half of those obtained in 1961 (see Table 4).
This ratio of half was decided upon

because it would have been unrealistic to assume that the proportions never married would be zero in these ages in later years. Any other ratio such as one-fourth or three-quarters would have been equally applicable. However, since the proportions never married were so small in these ages 20 to 39 years, the use of a ratio other than half would not have made any difference. Hence, all those females in excess of these were considered to have married sometime during t to t+5. But all of them may not be considered to remain married at time t + 5. Some of them may become widowed, and the period during which they were exposed to the risk of becoming widowed and the numbers becoming widowed were calculated as follows:
Those females aged 20 to 24 at time t+5 newly marrying during t to t+5 were of ages 15 to 19 at time t, and hence, all of them were not eligible for marriage throughout the period t to t+5. As they attain age 20 during f to t+5, they become eligible for marriage, and on an average they may be considered to be eligible for marriage for half the period during t to t+5. Hence, assuming that their marriages occur uniformly, they may be considered to spend one-fourth the time in married state during f to t+5. On these assumptions, if 6nJJ5 repre-

sents the surviving number of females of ages 20 to 24 at time f+ 5 newly marrying during f to t+5, the numbers becoming widowed and those remaining married amongst them at time f+ 5 were obtained as

respectively. Accordingly these were transferred to "others" and married categories of the age group 20 to 24 in the "intermediate marital status distribution."
On the other hand, all the females of ages 25 to 39 were eligible for marriage throughout the period t to t+5, and assuming that their marriages take place uniformly during t to f+5, they may be considered to spend half the time in married state during t to t+5. Thus, if snmt+li represents the number of surviving females of ages x to x+4 at time t+5 newly marrying during t to t + 5, the numbers becoming widowed and those remaining married amongst them at time t+5 were calculated as

respectively. Accordingly these were

transferred to "others" and married cate-

gories of ages 25 to 39 in the "intermediate marital status distribution."
The above method gave the final female population of ages 5 to 9, 10 to 14, 15 to 19 etc., for each marital status category at time t+5.

(b) Projection of Females of Ages 0 to 4 Years. For estimating the female population in the age group 0 to 4, the following procedure was used: The average annual number of female births during- the period t to t+5 was first calculated and by multiplying this by 5, the total number of female births during t to t+5 was obtained. Applying the survival ratio from birth to age group 0 to 4, the female population aged 0 to 4 in the year t+5 was obtained. The details are described below.
(i) The number of female births to females of ages 25 to 29 etc., during t to t+5 was obtained as

where x takes the values of 25, 30, 35, and 40; sMwUs refers to married females of ages x to x+4 in year t+5 given in "final marital status distribution" obtained as explained in Section 2.2(a), sfx denotes the marital fertility rate of females of ages x to x+4, and 0.4878 the proportion of female births corresponding to a sex ratio at birth of 105 males to 100 females. The age-specific marital fertility rates used were taken from the vital statistics of India, 1961, and are reproduced in Table 5.
These rates were for 70 towns with population between 100,000 and 1,000,000 in various states of India. These were selected because they seemed to be fairly

close to the actual level and pattern of age-specific marital fertility rates of India. When applied to married females given in Table 3, they gave a crude birth rate of 41.4 per 1,000 population which is very close to the crude birth rate of 41.7 obtained for the decade 1951 to 1961 by the Census Actuary of India. In obtaining the birth rate of 41.4, births occurring to females under 15 and over 45 years of age were not taken into account. These amounted to about 1.1% of the total number of births.
(ii) For calculating the number of female births to females of ages 20 to 24 newly marrying, it was assumed that on an average they spend one-fourth the time in married state as pointed out before, and contribute proportionately to births during t to (+5. Accordingly, the number of female births during t to t+5 to females of ages 20 to 24 were calculated as:

/20 x 0.4878
where sm^5 represents the number of females surviving married to ages 20 to 24 at time t+5 out of those of same ages marrying during t to t+5.
By adding the numbers of females births obtained in (i) and (ii), and by multiplying the sum by five, the total

number of female births during t to t+5 was obtained. By applying the survival ratio from birth to ages 0 to 4 to these births, the female population aged 0 to 4 at time t+5 was obtained. Thus the female population of year t by age and marital status was projected and the "final marital status distribution" for year t+5 was obtained.
This procedure of projecting the female population from year tto year t + 5 was repeated for years (+10, t+15 etc. Though no females under 20 years of age were assumed to marry after 1961, the age group 15 to 19 contributed births during 1961 to 1966 and 1966 to 1971 because some females of ages 10 to 14 were already married in 1961.

III. EFFECT OF CHANGES IN THE AGE AT MARRIAGE ON THE BIRTH RATE
3.1. Introduction
The effect of changes in the age at marriage is examined on
i. the proportions married at various ages
ii. the age composition and iii. the birth rate.
The marital status distribution and the birth rate were obtained at intervals of 5 years for a period of about 60 years starting from the year 1961 by the methods explained in sections 2.2 and 2.3 respectively. The proportions married in each age group, the proportional distribution of female population in broad age groups, viz, under 15, 15 to 44 and 45+, and the birth rate went on changing from year to year, and attained stable levels after 1996, i.e., after about 35 years from the start. Hence, the changes in (i) the proportions married, (ii) the age composition and (iii) the birth rate will be presented and discussed only up to 1996.
3.2 Effects on ProportionsMarried
The proportions married in each age group for the year 1961, and for later years calculated from the projected distributions are given in Table 6.

It may be seen that the proportions married in age groups 20 to 24, 25 to 29 etc., varied from year to year and became stable progressively after 15,20 etc., years respectively. Also, a noticeable increase in proportions married occurs only in age group 20 to 24, and in all other age groups changes were marginal as the numbers of new marriages were extremely small in those age groups because the proportions single were often less than one per cent. One other noticeable change is in the case of proportions married in age group 15 to 44. It may be seen that the ultimate decline in the proportions married in this age range amounts to 16.0%, and this is entirely due to the assumption that no female under 20 years of age marries after 1961.
It would be interesting to examine the consequences of raising the age at marriage of females to 20 years on the males who would have married females of ages under 20 years if the existing pattern of marriage had continued in later years. In 1961 there were about 19 million married females of ages 10 to 19 years, or nearly 43% of all females in these ages (see Table 3). After the establishment of the new marriage pattern, the additional number of marriages of females of ages 20 to 30 years in later years (assumed to compensate partly the prevented number of marriages of females under 20 years) amounted to only about 2.6% of all females of ages 10 to 19 years. This means that in later years 2.6 out of 43 or only 6% of such males who would have married females of ages under 20 years if the existing marriage pattern had continued would be able to find brides from other ages 20 to 39 years, but the remaining 94% will have to postpone their marriages on an average of at least 5 years.

3.3. Effect of the Age Distribution
The percentage age distribution of females in broad age groups under 15, 15 to 44, and 45+ for the year 1961, and for later years calculated from the projected distributions is given in Table 7.
It may be seen that the age distribution changes from year to year and stabilizes after 1996. Proportions of females in age groups 15 to 44 and 45+ increase at the cost of children under 15 years of age. Proportion of females of reproductive ages continuously increases from 1966 to a maximum of 47.2% in 1981, and declines to about 45.2% in 1996. One significant result is the reduction of population under 15 years from about 41.6% in 1961 to 38.0% in 1996 and later years.

3.4 Effect on the Birth Rate
The crude female birth rate of India obtained as explained in Section 2.3 for the years 1966, 1971, etc., is presented in Table 8. It may be seen that when the minimum age at marriage is raised to 20 years, in about 5 years time there will be a sudden fall in the birth rate to a level of 37.4 or by 9.6%. This further declines to a lowest level of 36.4 and then increases to a high of 40.2 in 1986. This is

only about 2.9% below the level obtained in the initial year 1961. This change may be examined in the light of the changes observed in the age composition of the population. The initial decline may be expected to arise because of the prevention of marriages of large numbers of females under 20 years of age. The increase between 1971-86 may be attributed to increasing proportions of females in the reproductive ages.
The birth rate after the above transitory changes declines again and stabilizes at a level of about 37.5 which is 9.4% below the level obtained in 1961. It may be observed that this ultimate reduction of 9.4% in the birth rate is smaller than the reductions in proportions married in age range 15 to 44 viz., 16.0% and in total fertility rate viz., 12.2% from 6.35 to 5.58. The smaller decline in the birth rate than that in the total fertility rate may partly be due to the increased proportions married at ages 20 to 39 in later years. In the absence of any assumption about the increased proportions marrying at ages 20 to 39, the declines in the proportions married at ages 15 to 44 would have been even more than 16%. Hence, it may be said that the reductions in the proportions married at ages 15 to 44 through a rise in the age at marriage may not imply commensurate reductions in the birth rate.

3.5 Implications of Assumptions Made in the Study
It may be noticed that the ultimate change in the birth rate observed in this study is much smaller than the change obtained by many authors mentioned above. Unlike the earlier studies where average age at marriage was assumed to rise to 19 or 20 years, in this study the minimum age at marriage was assumed to be 20 years. Consequently, the average age at marriage would be slightly higher than 20 years. In fact the singulate mean age at marriage after the establishment of the new marriage pattern works out to 20.16 years. Hence the decline in the birth rate observed may at least be equal to that which would be achieved by raising the average age at marriage to 19 or 20 years. Of course there could be other sets of proportions single by age corresponding to an average age at marriage of 20 and which, by giving less weight than the present assumptions to the high birth rates prevalent at ages 20 to 24 or 25 to 29, yield larger estimates of the decline in the birth rate. But this is possible only if fewer proportions marry at 20 to 24 and neighboring ages. However, under one of the important assumptions made in the study, viz., of retaining the present universality of marriage, proportions marrying at these ages cannot be small. Hence, under this condition, no other set of proportions single by age corresponding to an average age at marriage of 20 can possibly give a higher decline in the birth rate than the one obtained by raising the minimum age at marriage to age 20. Thus, the decline in the birth rate observed may be considered to provide an upper limit to that which would be achieved by raising the average age at marriage to 19 or 20 years.
It was assumed that increased propor-

tions marry in ages 20 to 39 years to compensate partly for the prevented marriages of females of ages 10 to 19 years. In the absence of this assumption, the decline in the birth rate would be slightly higher than that observed in this study.
The schedule of marital fertility rates was kept constant throughout the period considered. It may be pointed out that the fertility rates at a specified age of two groups of females marrying at different ages may not be the same. The available evidence shows that generally the group having shorter duration of marriage will have a higher rate at a particular age than the group with longer duration at the same age (Basavarajappa, 1964; Sheps, 1965). This has been found in populations which practise as well as those which do not practise contraception. There are reasons to believe that the data collected by the Directorate of National Sample Survey for rural areas of India show a similar pattern (see Table 9).
As the ages at marriage of females in Kerala are higher, in each age group, on an average, they may be considered to have shorter durations of marriage than those in other states. It may be noted that the rates for females of ages 25 and over for Kerala are distinctly higher than the corresponding rates for other states. The lower rates in the first two age

groups for Kerala are obviously due to smaller proportions married in these age groups. On the other hand, slightly higher proportions married in Kerala than those in Madras and Mysore in the age group 25 to 44 cannot explain fully the differences between the fertility rates in these ages for Kerala and those for other states (see Table 10).
Thus, when the minimum age at marriage was raised to 20 years, slightly higher fertility rates should have been used. In this event, the decline in the birth rate would be smaller than that observed in the present study.
The schedule of mortality was kept constant throughout the period considered. Instead, a schedule of declining mortality could have been used. However, in view of the earlier finding that when "marriage pattern" and the schedule of marital fertility rates are kept con-

stant, even large declines in mortality produce only marginal increases in the birth rate (Basavarajappa, 1963), it was not considered necessary to use a schedule of declining mortality. If schedules of declining mortality were used, the decline in the birth rate would have been smaller than that observed in the present study.
Again, no differences in mortality according to marital status were assumed. The available evidence indicates a distinctly higher mortality for single, widowed, and divorced than for married females (Dublin and Spiegleman, 1949). This may not be so in countries where maternal mortality is likely to be high. However, in India in the recent past great improvements in maternal and child health have taken place and these may be expected to continue in coming years. Hence, had the lower mortality for married females been used, the numbers surviving as married would be higher in later years, and as a result the estimated decline in the birth rate would be smaller than that observed in this study.
It was assumed that there were no widow remarriages and divorces. The effect of these two on the decline in the birth rate would be in opposite directions from each other. If allowances were made for widow remarriage and divorce, the former would have had the effect of reducing the decline in the birth rate, while the latter would have increased it.
Summarizing, it may be said that the assumptions regarding the minimum age at marriage, constant schedules of fertility and mortality, absence of differences in mortality according to marital status, and the absence of widow remarriages tend to exaggerate the decline in the birth rate when the average age at marriage rises to 19 or 20 years. On the other hand, the assumption regarding the in-

creased proportions marrying at ages 20
to 39 years and the absence of divorces
tend to reduce the decline. Though the
relative importance of these two groups
of opposing factors is not precisely
known, it may be concluded that other
things being equal, the decline in the
birth rate that could be achieved by
raising the average age at marriage to
19 or 20 years may not exceed that ob-
served in this study.
By a similar analysis, the effect of
changes in ages at marriage could be
studied on the male birth rate. However,
as there is no reason to believe that the
sex ratio of the Indian population may
undergo radical changes, and that the sex
ratio at birth is even more stable than
the sex ratio of the population, the
changes observed in the female birth
rate could be considered to represent the
changes in the general crude birth rate.
3.6. Conclusion
i. The ultimate decline in the birth rate that may be expected to result by raising the average or minimum age at marriage to 19 or 20 years in India may not exceed 10 per cent.
ii. When the average or minimum age at marriage of females is raised to 19 or 20 years, a substantial reduction in the proportion married in the reproductive ages 15 to 44 may be expected to occur and bring about a reduction in the birth rate. However, such a decline of 16 or more per cent in the proportion married in the reproductive ages observed in the study did not produce a commensurate decline in the birth rate.
iii. A large majority of nearly 94 per cent of the males who would have married females under 20 years of age if the existing pattern of marriage had continued may have to postpone their marriages by at least 5 years when the minimum age at marriage of females is raised to 20 years.
iv. Through socially raising the minimum age at marriage to 19 or 20 years

26

is a desirable thing, it cannot provide a satisfactory solution to the population problem India is facing today. However, any legislation in favor of it mayat least create an awareness among the people of the necessity of raising the present extremely lowlevel of ageatmarriage.
