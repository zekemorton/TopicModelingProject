And so on, through the whole span of life. This method takes into account not only
the differences of infant mortality, but tries to consider the whole loss of life before the

assumption that this loss is of an order of magnitude about twice the infant mortality rate, which seems to be more or less the case
in civilized countries. It yields of course only
approximate values, but I think the results

VIII). That is due to the fact that the marriage age of class IV is a little higher, while the
men in class VIII both marry much later and
remain single more frequently than in any
other large group. The computation of the total legitimate paternity rate for married men makes the superiority of the skilled
workers over the agricultural labourers disappear and reduces substantially the advantage of miners (class VII) over unskilled workmen (class V). The net rates reveal the fact that both the upper and middle classes and the textile workers had already passed below the replacement line-at least as far as legitimate children are concerned-whereas miners and unskilled workers were still

would reduce the rates too much because in the trades an unknown, but certainly considerable proportion of young men is married before reaching economic independence, viz. as journeymen, shop assistants or in similar positions. This difficulty can best be avoided
by amalgamating employers, workers of their
own and wage earners in the same occupa-

tional group under one heading, as has been done in the English statistics of i9ii. For the same reasons the sons of farmers are taken in the same group as, their fathers.
Retrospective observation by fertility census seems to be the only feasible method for
studying reproduction differences between masters and assistants in the same trade.
