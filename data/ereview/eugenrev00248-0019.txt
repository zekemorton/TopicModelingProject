age statements in vital registration, especially
for the Moslems, are similar to those found
in the census.* The resultant errors un-
doubtedly reduce the validity of age-specific fertility rates and it is possible that the peculiarly high fertility rates found for certain age-groups of Moslem women in very
recent years are in reality due to a combina-
tion of errors in age statements in census and vital records. Vital registration is improving both in completeness and in the range of data covered, and birth statistics, for example, are now available by religous group, age of
parents, order of birth and duration of marriage. In combination with the next census, which is due to be taken in the autumn of 1946, it should be possible to undertake detailed studies of variations in
fertility between groups and over time, especially as the census schedule itself will contain questions on the total number of children ever born and the duration of the present marriage. It may be that I946 is an

Early Studies of Population Trends
Earlier official reports on Palestine were somewhat crude in their approach to the question of population trends. The Shaw
Report assumed various crude rates of natural increase for the population as a whole, and various annual amounts of Jewish immigration.* The Peel Report assumed that the Arab population would grow in accordance with a logistic curve, rising from o 943 millions in 1936 to I82I
millions in I970, and that'the Jewish popula-
tion would maintain an annual crude rate of
natural increase of 2I-OI per thousand, superimposed upon which were various hypotheses regarding the annual intake of migrants. Thus with no immigration the Jewish population would grow from o0373 millions to 0 * 757 millions between I936 and I970, while with 6o,ooo immigrants a year the Jewish population by I970 would amount to 3 735 millions.t But these methods of estimation do not take into account in any

censal estimates by age and sex for a country in which migration is an important element in population growth, and especially when there is unrecorded clandestine immigration. Yet in speculating upon future growth in Palestine it is clearly most important to take into account the developments in fertility and mortality since I93I.
Recent Work on Population Growth
In the absence of appropriate post-censal population estimates Notestein and Jurkat, in their study of Palestine, made use of crude birth and death rates and infant mortality rates, through drawing attention to the unsatisfactory nature of the two former rates.* These two authors-argued that there has been a similar decline in mortality for both Jews and Moslems, though regional figures suggest that " in the areas with substantial Jewish minorities, mortality was declining more rapidly among non-Jews than among Jews." So far as infant and child mortality is concerned, this is supported by a recent study
by Bachi and Kallner,t and it is particularly
important in considering how far Western influences may reduce Moslem mortality in the future. For example, the Department of Statistics life table for Moslem women in I930-2 shows an expectation of life at age I0 of about 54 years, less than five years below that of England and Wales for the same date.t+ Even allowing for some exaggeration in the Moslem life table, it nevertheless shows the potential effect of reductions in infant and child mortality among Moslems, for the relevant expectation of life at birth was only about 42 years, as compared with almost 63 years for England and Wales.
On fertility, Notestein and Jurkat inferred from the course of the crude birth rates that there had been a decline among both Jews and Moslems, though greater among the fonner. 'Their views was: "Part of the decline [among Moslems] may actually have

been due to changing age distributions, as the short cohorts born during the First World War were coming into the childbearing period. However, it seems unlikely that this explains the entire drop, and virtually certain that fertility actually declined. It is fair to conclude that even in the short span of modernization, the Moslem birth rate was beginning to respond downward." This conclusion has, of course, an important bearing upon the relative future contributions of the two main communities to the population of Palestine. But other evidence siiggests that the fall in Moslem fertility is illusory and that, instead, the course of fertility since I93I has swung even more in favour of Moslem reproduction than Notestein and Jurkat believed to be the case.

The point is that the crude birth and death rates shown in Table I have become increasingly warped by changes in the age structure of the respective populations. In the case of the Moslems, for whom population growth has been almost entirely by natural increase -even supposing there has been an increase in illegal immigration-the reductions in infant and child mortality will have swollen the proportion of young children in the population. At the same time, as Notestein and Jurkat pointed out, the girls aged IO-I9 years in I93I would, as they passed into the adult age-groups, lessen the numbers of potential mothers. By I94I, therefore, the Moslem population, which even in I93I was less favourable, in its age composition, to fertility than the Jewish population, would

be still less so. For the Jewish population, on -the other hand, the continuous flow of immigrants in the adult ages would maintain the relatively favourable age structure-that
is, favourable from the point of view of fertility. This is shown in Table II, which summarizes some of the relevant statistics. Taking into account the large volume of immigration-there were about 220,000 registered Jewish immigrants between I9.3I and 1940-the figures suggest that by I94I the population was not significantly less favour-
able in its age structure than in I93I.

The level of Moslem fertility in I94I-2
may be calculated by making use of an estimate of the age-distribution of the Moslem
population of Palestine as at the end of I94I, prepared by the Central Bureau of Medical Statistics of the Haddasah Medical Organization. Though, in view of the difficulties mentioned earlier, the estimate cannot be regarded as more than approximate, there is no reason to doubt its general validity.§ Based on that estimate and the births and
deaths from the relevant issues of the Annual Bulletin of Vital Statistics, the gross reproduction rate for Moslems in I94I-2 was 3'9I and the net rate 2 '48, as compared with Dr. Hinden's rates for I93I of 3.33 and i*88 respectively. Even assuming that the postcensal estimates of the Moslem population are somewhat understated, there is no reason to believe that the overall fertility of Moslem

women has declined and it is probable that there has been some increase since I93I, though perhaps not as much as indicated by the rise in the gross reproduction rate. As regards the net reproduction rate, there
seems no reason to doubt that it had risen
substantially and that by I941-2 it was one of the highest found at any time or in any place. It implies a rate of growth of almost
I50 per cent in each generation, and Table III indicates how the Moslem popula-
tion would increase if the fertility and
mortality of I94I-2 were maintained.

discussed with the community and in terms of whether the community can afford to have additional children at that time.* This kind of attitude would provide an element of resilience, helping to raise fertility with improved economic conditions or prospects. It may in part account for the abandoning of previous postponement of bitths within marriage which is suggested by the run of the birth statistics between I942 and i943-t Propaganda for larger families-as part of the general desire for expansion and selfprotection-may also be having some effect. But in the absence of any more fundamental change than has so far occurred, it would seem probable on balance that the fertility of Jewish immigrants would follow the general course of fertility of the countries from which they derive, though on a higher level.

t Among Jewish women the largest proportional
increase in births between 1942 and 1943 was for second births and especially for women aged between 30 and 45 years of age. It has been suggested that the increase in births to these women may be partly explained by the shortage of contraceptives, which became very marked after 1942.

The conclusion, which is by no means novel, is that the fertility of the Moslems is unlikely to fall rapidly in the near future but that the fertility of the Jews is likely to -follow the course observed between I93I and I94I. Even this conclusion is, however, very tentative, for there is not a sufficient run of reliable and comprehensive statistics to serve as a basis for analysis. It is imperative that the demographic statistics of Palestine be improved and expanded so that changes in the inherent rates of growth of the various communities can be seen if and when they occur. This is not just a matter of academic interest but of direct relevance to the economy of the country. The demographic factor is one of the most important factors in any consideration of the future of Palestine. Every effort should be made to ensure that the basic census and vital statistics are appropriate to the importance of the population question.*
* I very much hope that, when the post-censal population estimates have been checked against the preliminary results of the impending census, it will be possible to publish the detailed report of the Department of Statistics, Considerations on the Future Development of the Population of Palestine, which has been the basis of a large part of this note.
