OBSERVATIONS ON RACIAL CHARACTERISTICS IN ENGLAND.

BY B. S. BRAMWELL.

(Continuation*.)

In my first test I took the following names for my Northern group :-Adamson, Alderson, Armstrong, Braithwaite, Carr, Clarkson, Coulson, Crabtree, Dixon, Dobson, Farrar, Fawcett, Fenwick, Gibson, Graham, Hislop, Hobson, Hodgson, Hudson, Hutchinson, Irving, Jefferson, Jobson, Kay and Lawson. For my Welsh group I took the following:-Bevan, David, Edmunds. Francis, George, Griffith, Humphrys, James, Jenkins, Llewellyn, Lloyd, Morris, Owen, Parry, Powell, Powys, Price, Pritchard, Rees, Richards and Willis. By a fortunate chance the relative frequency of the two groups in this second series appears to be practically identical with that in the first series of names. The percentage of the Northern group in the total for Finchley is here thirty-seven and a fraction, as against thirtyeight in the first series, and for Edinburgh eighty-four, as against
.eighty-,one. We can thus compare one series directly with the other
without injustice or, where names are scanty, make a compound series which is also directlv comparable.
I applied this series of names to the six larger Cambridge Tripos lists and give the results in the same form as in the case of the first
series.

Converting these figures into the relative frequency in 10,000 names and bearing in mind that the results from the smaller Tripos lists where not many names are involved, cannot be so stable as those from the three larger lists, we find the following results:

OBSERVATIONS OF RACIAL CHARACTERISTICS. 557

There are some points of similarity between the two series. In each Mathematics is the most frequent study of the Northern group
and the least frequent in the Welsh group. In each History is a favourite study of the Welsh group. As compared with Finchley the
Northern names are with one exception much more frequent at
Cambridge. This tendency cannot be traced in the Welsh groups, where the frequency is more irregular. With regard to the Mathematical lists one should mention a point which tells rather against the
theory of racial preference in the choice of study. The mathematical
lists start as far back as 1753. In these lists the predominance of
Northern names is the most marked. Now if we take the period 1753-1822 and compare it with the period 1823-1871 and the period
1872-1910 we find that the relative frequency of the first Northern group of names to the first Welsh group of names for these periods are
as follows :-313: 225, 258 : 317, 265: 308. I think that the explanation of this change in the ratio between the first and the
second periods may be due to increased facilities of travel. Perhaps there were fewer Welsh names in the earlier mathematical lists because there were fewer Welsh names in Cambridge. The ratios for the second and third periods are approximately the same. Now the other lists do not go back to this first period when there were perhaps fewer of the Welsh group in the University. So perhaps we should expect to find the Welsh group relatively more frequent in these lists. There is, however, no need to exaggerate the importance of these considerations. If we refer to the second and third periods of the Mathematical Tripos, we find that the percentage of Northern names in the total of both groups is 45% for the second period and 46% for the third period. These percentages are higher than those to be found in any of the five
other Tripos lists. Let us now look at the relative number of first, second and third
class distinctions in the second series of names: 1st. 2nd. 3rd.

The result in the Mathematical Tripos is similar to that in the
former series, but less pronounced. In the Classical Tripos it is more pronounced, but in the Science Tripos it in no way confirms that in the previous series, and there is very little to choose between Northern
and Welsh. The three smaller Tripos lists also do not confirm the former results to any marked extent.
I think, therefore, that our second summary of the position must
be rather more hesitating than the first one. The Northern groups are more inclined to pursue mathematics than the Welsh groups and seem to meet with more success in this study. They are perhaps a little more inclined to study Classics, but here the Welsh groups appear to be rather more successful. The Welsh groups are more inclined to study history. This appears as far as we are justified in going on the evidence so far adduced.
There are some smaller Tripos lists which repay examination. As the number of candidates is small, I have added together the pairs
of groups which were previously examined separately. In one case I have made a composite languages group, composed of the Semitic, Indian, Oriental, and Medieval and Modern Languages Tripos lists:

Before passing on to consider figures drawn from other Universities, it is convenient to throw these Cambridge figures into one list. I have added a few other instances. The Northern element diminishes from above downwards and the figure in brackets is the
percentage of Northern names in the total of both groups

One must not scrutinise the percentage figure too closely, as the figures from which it is derived are sometimes large and sometimes small. There are at least two anomalous results. Otherwise the various entries from the same Tripos keep close together and the list shows a fall from the more exact to the more argumentative
forms of study.

When one turns one's attention to other Universities, a preliminary question is what is the normal percentage of Northern names in
the total. This naturally varies. I give a few instances

I have also the figures for Harvard University from 1636-1915.
I have had to omit the name Davies from the Welsh Group, as this spelling appears to be rare in the States. One suspects that Davies is concealed under Davis, which is common:

The corresponding percentages for Durham and Cambridge with Davies omitted are -54% and 44% respectively. So the Northern element in Harvard is high. Is this indicative of a greater roving disposition in the Northern element?
I gathered the following figures relating to the first series of names from the Durham University Calendar:-

The percentages in the case of Armstrong College are nearly identical with that for the general population of Newcastle. That for Durham University members is much lower. This may be an indication that the University partakes of a national rather than a provincial character. The figures for Mathematics and Theology are small, but are generally consistent with those of Cambridge.
I also took out some figures from the Oxford class lists. The period taken is from 1901 to 1914. The names are those of the first

The Mathematical school is not in accord with our previous experience, but as the numbers in it are so small, we need not perhaps place much reliance on them. Otherwise the list closely resembles the Cambridge result. Science takes the place of Mathematics. Classics come second, and Law, History and Theology fourth, fifth and sixth in each list.
We have now considered a large volume of evidence dealing with Universities and should summarise our conclusions before passing on to consider professions and trades. There is evidence, firstly, that our method of selected names is not unsound. Taking Finchley as our standard, we find that Leeds, Durham and Cambridge show a distinctly higher percentage of Northern names, and Oxford, London University and the University of Wales a distinctly lower percentage. The relative position of Oxford and Cambridge is in agreement with Havelock Ellis' statement in " British Genius." The percentage of Northern names at the Welsh University is exactly that which I found in examining a list of Welsh International football players. Coming now to the subjects of study, we have, I think, undoubted evidence that the Northerners are more prone to study mathematics than the Welsh group. We have some evidence that this is also true of Mechanics. It is also true to a lesser extent of Classics. We have

OBSERVATIONS OF RACIAL CHARACTERISTICS. 561L
evidence that they are better at Mathematics, but probably not so good at Classics. In Natural Science the Northerners preponderate at Durham and Oxford. At Cambridge this subject is about the border line. This may be due to the great prestige of the Mathematical school drawing to it students who at other Universities would take to the study of Science direct. Northerners are probably less inclined to study Law, certainly less inclined to study History, and assuredly less inclined to study Theology. We have some evidence that this is true also of Oriental and Modern Languages.

Let us now turn to figures from the professions. They refer to names of the first series. They are drawn from two sources, the annual year books of the professions and the London Directory. Some therefore refer to the country at large and others only to London. As I have no direct means of judging whether the ratio between the two groups is different, taking London and England as a whole, it might perhaps have been better to separate the figures into two lists. Such evidence as I have, however, inclines me to think that the difference is slight. In some cases the figures are large and in others small. In nine instances the figures have been standardised to frequency per 10,000; in the later figures I have not rmade this standardisation which is unnecessary for purposes of comparison if the percentage of Northerners in the total is given, and indeed, by obscuring the actual figures upon which this percentage is based, deprives us of a ready means of judging how much weight should be attached to any individual result. The entry Air-pilots refers to the names in a list of the first airmen to win their certificates. The actual number in the list was a little over 2,000, but the figures here given are standardised:-

Several of these entries refer to the same profession; others fall

into analogous groups. The only serious anomaly is the divergence of

the two groups of Accountants. I think that there is a distinct

resemblance to the order in the University Class Lists. Mechanics,

Mathematics, Science, Law and Theology. There is certainly a descent

from constructive and scientific to more argumentative and oratorical

pursuits. Also possibly from the more hazardous to the less

adventurous.

I next considered Trades. Here, with one exception, that of

"Old Clockmakers," which is taken from Mr. F. J. Britten's book,

the figures are all derived from the London Directory. The period of

the Clockmakers ends in 1842 and the area from which they are taken

is a wide one as it includes America. None of the figures are

The list generally is instructive. As we work down it, we pass from constructive trades more and more into a region of pure retail.
The position of butchers is of interest, as it has been stated that
butchers tend to be fair and shoemakers to be dark. (See British
Genius, p. 86.) It is commonly said that butchers are a prosperous
folk and rarely go bankrupt, whereas with drapers the reverse is said to be the case. The position of dairymen puzzled me so much that I thought there must be some error. The possibility of multiple shops
occurred to me, though I could not trace their existence to any marked
extent in the Directory. To clear it up, I tested the matter with my second series of names and obtained exactly the same percentage. It is clear therefore that this industry is very largely in the hands of the Welsh group. Speaking generally, the conclusions to be drawn from this list are analogous to those already drawn from the professional and University lists. We might perhaps sum the matter up by saying that in pursuits where proficiency depends on mechanical or constructive skill, the Northern element appears prominent, but if proficiency depends on the spoken word or argument or persuasion, then the
Welsh element is more strongly represented than one would anticipate. I think, too, that we might note as a hypothesis worthy of examination that the rewards in the pursuits favoured by the Northern group are more certain; the pursuits favoured by the Welsh group are more
precarious, though success in them offers big prizes. This finishes my detailed examination of University Class lists,
Professions and Trades. I have, however, some other lists of figures which may be used for the purpose of testing the conclusions which I
have drawn. The first is of a miscellaneous character :-

Here again we notice the same descent from the more scientific and exact qualities. The position of the J.P.s is very similar to that found for legal pursuits in other lists. It will be noted that the percentage for the Telephone Directory comes out at two points less than that for Finchley residents. As the nuumbers involved are in each case substantial, I verified this observation by means of my second list of names. I there found that the Telephone percentage came out four points lower than the Finchley percentage.
As a further test for some of these conclusions, I turned my attention to the staffs of some of the Government offices. I took two where one would conclude that the characteristics peculiar to those pursuits which the Northern group appear to favour would be of advantage, namely, the Examiners and Staff of the Patent Office and the Engineering Staff of the Post Office, and compared them with the clerical staff of the Board of Education where such characteristics

These figures, I think, furnish a strong confirmation of my argu-
ment.
It is sometimes argued that as so much intermixture has taken place in our island that there can be little possibility ,f tracing racial differences. The argument takes this form.
Twenty-five generations back one could have had thirty-three
million separate ancestors. At that period the population of
these islands was probably in the neighbourhood of six millions. There-
fore the probability is that everyone is descended from everyone alive at that time who has now living descendants. This is pure conjecture. It is incapable of proof or disproof. No one will ever know more than a very small fraction of their possible 66,000,000 ancestors in the last 25 generations or all the people alive in England 700 years
ago. If the material were available it would take a large Government Office months to collate it. We can, however, get some interesting sidelights on the subject from the study of genealogies. Whatever the answer to the above conjecture may be, genealogies show us that we
are probably descended many times over and through many different lines of descent from the same individual. I have one in my possession relating to people alive at the present day. An ancestor who died in 1606 was descended five times over from a man and his wife who died about 1250. Now this ancestor who died in 1606 only forms an eight thousandth part of the present day people's pedigree and of his pedigree back to 1250 I only possess about one two hundredth part. In this one million six hundredth part these names appear five times, how many times may they not appear in the whole circle of twenty-fifth generation ancestors? I think that by asking the aid of some of the Genealogical societies we might be able to obtain very interesting information on the amount of intermarriage in certain cases. It should be possible to work out pedigrees of Royalty and

566 EUGENICS REVIEW.
some of the Nobility fairly completely in every direction for the last ten generations.
An argument which appears to me to have more force is that we may in the last hundred years have started to fuse at a rapid rate. I think that I have produced some evidence to show that fusion is not complete. By a study of, say the London Directories, during the last hundred years, we might be able to throw some light on this problem. Are the various surnames becoming more uniformly distributed in the various occupations?
Let us conclude by trying to summarise the whole matter. We have found that the lists of names used are typical of geographical areas. When these lists are applied to occupations carried on in some neutral area such as Cambridge University, the County of London or England as a whole, distinctive mental characteristics are noticeable in the two groups. These differences suggest that racial fusion has not as yet been completed in our country, so far as mental qualities are concerned. It is difficult to believe that environment can account for say the curious position with regard to dairymen in London. One naturally asks "What environment? " Ex hypothesi it cannot be that of London which is identical for the two groups. One concludes that it must be due to race, but it is argued against this conclusion that we must not regard our population as nmade up of two types, that there is every gradation of long-bead to be found amongst us between the pure Nordic and the pure Mediterranean, and that many of these long-heads have not arisen from those races at all. Also that in addition there is a considerable percentage of broadheaded people. This may well be without affecting my argument. Such scanty material as I had available in the Cambridge names disclosed a large percentage of brachicephalic types. But I have no status to argue on anthropological matters. My point is that I chose the names of my Northern group from that part of the country which was greatly subjected to incursions of Angles and Danes in historic times, and applying these names to occupations in neutral areas, I have demonstrated mental differences when they are compared with names drawn from Wales and the Welsh border. If these names cover a large fraction in each group which is identical racially, then deducting this common fraction one would imagine that the differences so far from disappearing would be still more marked.
It would be easy to exaggerate the mental differences found. At the same time it is claimed that they are quite distinctive. In the one case a greater tendency towards construction, creation and such exercises as yield "fruit" in the Baconian sense and in the higher planes the pursuit of a train of thought a step or two further than most can ; 'in fact, a slightly greater tendency to exercise pure reason. In the other case, the oral word, argument, the appeal to the emotions. The one slightly inclined to look forward, the other slightly inclined to look hack. We have seen that more Senior Wranglers and Fellows of the Roval Society than we should anticipate come from the Northern source. One would exnect to find more Welsh names on the .TJ'ilicial Bench. As rApards the other Pench, I found in a list of Bishops of the last eighty years seven Welsh
