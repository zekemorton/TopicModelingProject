Dermatoglyphics in XXYY Klinefelter's Syndrome by MILTON ALTER, ROBERT GORLIN, JORGE
YUNIS, FREDRICK PEAGLER and HEINZ BRUHL.
The main dermatoglyphic features of this variant of Klinefelter's syndrome included low ridge count, unusual hypothenar patterns, rather wider atd angle (summed for the two hands) than in controls, ulnar displaced proximal triradii and simian lines. Results of the present study support those of Uchida et al. (1964).
Population Genetic Studies in the Congo. I. Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency, Hemoglobin S, and Malaria by A. G. MOTULSKY, J. VANDEPITTE and G. R. FRASER.
Hb S was the only abnormal haemoglobin found in the populations studied, and the distribution of the S gene roughly corresponded to that of G6PD deficiency. The Pygmies were an exception in having a very high frequency of sickling but low frequency of G6PD deficiency, possibly explained by shortened red cell survival-resulting in abnormally high red cell enzyme levelsdue to chronic illness. Falciparum malaria was common, three quarters of the older children in six Yaka villages being infected, and infection rates were similar in sicklers and in enzyme-deficient subjects. The combined data indicate protection by these two traits against malaria, G6PDdeficiency probably being the less effective of the two.
Population Genetic Studies in the Congo. HI. Effect of Hemoglobin S and Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency on Mortality and Fertility by G. R. FRASER.
There is some evidence to suggest that Hb AS people and females heterozygous for G6PD deficiency in the Congolese populations may be more fertile than their normal homozygotes. Sibs of Hb AS individuals showed a higher mortality than sibs of Hb A individuals, possibly indicating a relative disadvantage of the former, once infancy-the critical period for malarial immunityis passed.
Population Genetic Studies in the Congo. m. Blood Groups (ABO, MNSs, Rh, Jsa ) by G. R.
FRASER, E. R. GIBLETT and A. G. MOTULSKY.
The Pygmies, as would be expected from their unique ethnic character, showed blood group
frequencies distinct from the other tribal groups studied.
Population Genetic Studies in the Congo. IV. Haptoglobin and Transferrin Serum Groups in the CongoandinOtherAfricanPopulationsby E. R. GIBLETT, A. G. MOTULSKY and 0. R. FRASER.
There was a high frequency of Hpl as in most other areas of Africa.
Genetic Linkage Between Structural Loci for Albumin and Group Specific Component (Gc) by L. R.
WEITKAMP, D. L. RUCKNAGEL and H. GERSHOWITZ.
There was only one recombinant in forty-two informative offspring for whom both parents were genotyped. The map distance between the two loci is calculated as about 1-5 per cent.
Familal Reciprocal C/18 Translocation by HOPE H. PUNNET, LEONARD PINSKY, ANGELO M.
DIGEORGE and ROBERT J. GORLIN.
This is the first reported instance of a presumed familial translocation between chromosome 18 and a member of the C group. The proband showed a rare constellation of congenital abnormalities including mental retardation, while several "carriers" of the balanced translocation were phenotypically normal.
Hemoglobin Kagoshima: An Example of Hemoglobin Norfolk in a Japanese Family by
TAKSHI IMAMURA.
The haemoglobin described is a fast-moving variant of Hb A; it is probably identicalwith haemoglobin Norfolk.

Family Studies of a Human Serum Isoantigen System (Australia Antigen) by B. S. BLUMBERG,
LIISA MELARTIN, R. A. GUINTO and BARBARA WERNER.
This newly discovered serum protein-probably a lipoprotein-behaved as an autosomal recessive trait in the families studied. The trait has widely different population frequencies, being absent in US whites and Negroes but common in several East Asian and Pacific populations. It is commoner in younger age groups and, in some populations, in males, and an individual's phenotype (including those with leukaemia and thalassaemia) appears to be constant over a period of time.

The Frequency of Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase Deficiency in the Newborns and Adults in

Kuwait by YEHIA SHAKER, A. ONSI and R. AZIZ.

The overall incidence of this trait was 22-3 per cent in newborns and 20A4 per cent in adult

males.

Hereditary Multiple Epiphysial Dysplasia by D. HOEFNAGEL, L. K. SYCAMORE, S. W. RUSSELL and W. E. BUCKNALL.
A pedigree of the above syndrome is reported and discussed.
The Linkage Relation of Xg to G6PD in Israelis: the evidence of a second series of families. A. ADAM, PATRICIA TIPPETT, JUNE GAVIN, JEAN NOADES, RUTH SANGER and R. R. RACE.
Further evidence indicates that the linkage between Xg and G6PD is not as close as was
previously thought.
Further Studies on the Genetics of Placental ALkaline Phosphatase by ELIZABETH B. ROBSON and
HARRY HARRIS.
Six common and nine rare phenotypes of human placental alkaline phosphatase are described. Evidence from both single and twin births strongly suggests that they are determined by three common and six rare alleles at an autosomal locus of the foetus. Frequencies among Negroes are different from those in an English population. A model is proposed to account for the triple-banded pattern of heterozygotes.
Data on Linkage between the Locus Determining Placental Alkaline Phosphatase (P1) and other
Markers by J. H. EDWARDS and JUNE WINGHAM. Twin data revealed no evidence of linkage between the locus for placental alkaline phosphate
and eleven other markers.
Sex-linked Genes in Man and the Lyon Hypothesis by HANS GRtNEBERG. A review of sixty sex-linked genes in man fails to support the Lyon hypothesis.
A Statistical Study of Intrauterine Selection Factors related to the ABO System. I. The analysis of data on liveborn children by ERIC PERITZ.
Data on the ABO frequencies in live-born children from different mating types are described and discussed.
Taste Polymorphism to Anetholtrithione and Phenylthiocarbamate by W. DAWSON, G. B. WEST and
H. KALMUS.
The distribution of the taste threshold of anetholtrithione (ATTH) is bimodal. There is a very high correlation between the thresholds for ATTH and for PTC, and it is concluded that the two polymorphisms are identical.
Is Weinberg's Differential Rule Defective? by K. 0. RENKONEN. Weinberg's rule for estimating the frequencies of monozygotic and dizygotic twins for the
frequencies of like-sexed and unliked-sexed twins gives a lower proportion of monozygotic twins

in the adult population than at birth. The author considers this a defect in Weinberg's rule, but it seems to the reviewer to be simply a consequence of the differential mortality of the two types of twins.
May 1967, Vol. 30, Part 4.
Haemoglobin Bart's Hydrops Foetalis in Thailand by S. POOTRAKUL, P. WASI and S. NA-NAKORN. Fifteen cases of the above syndrome are described, all of whom died before or shortly after
birth. Familial studies indicate that the syndrome is caused by homozygosity for an a-thalassaemia gene.
Pericentric Inversion in a Group D Chromosome (13-15) associated with Amenorrhea and Gonadal Dysgenesis by M. M. COHEN, V. J. CAPRARO and N. TAKAGI.
A case is reported of a woman with amenorrhea and rudimentary ovaries associated with an abnormality of one of the chromosomes in the 13-15 group.
DNA Replication Analysis of Six 13-15/21 Translocation Families by MARGARETA MIKKELSEN. Autoradiographic studies were performed on nine individuals from six families having a
translocation of a chromosome in the 13-15 group with chromosome 21 in order to determine which of the chromosomes 13-15 was involved. It was found to be chromosome 14 in five families and chromosome 15 in one family.
The Effect of Mutation on Fitness in a System of Two Co-adapted Loci by JOHN R. G. TURNER. It is shown that mutation at polymorphic loci may have little effect on fitness when the loci
are considered singly, but that the effect may be comparatively large when two epistatic loci are considered simultaneously.
Neighbourhood Knowledge and the Distribution of Marriage Distances by A. J. BOYCE, C. F.
KUCHEMANN and G. A. HARRISON.
A model is proposed to explain the distribution of marriage distances, and is tested on data for an Oxfordshire parish from the 1861 census.
Inherited Quantitative Variations of Human Phosphogluconate Dehydrogenase by C. W. P A R R and
LINDA I. FITCH.
The pedigrees of two families with deficiencies of the above enzyme are described and discussed.
Electrophoretic Variants of Human 6-Phosphogluconate Dehydrogenase: population and family studies and description of a new variant by RONALD G. DAVIDSON.
The electrophoretic pattern of the above enzyme was determined in a large population of whites and negroes. A new variant was discovered as well as a racial difference in the frequencies of the two common alleles. Family studies indicate that all the variants are due to autosomal co-dominant alleles.
Hereditary Elliptocytosis: linkage data in man by R. A. G E E R D I N K, L. E. N I J E N H U IS and J.
HUIZINGA.
Data on six Dutch families indicate that there are two types of elliptocytosis, one of which is closely linked to the Rhesus factor and the other of which is not. There is evidence that these two types are biochemically as well as genetically distinct.
On the Effects of Natural Selection on Correlations between Relatives by CAROLYN R. LEAC H and
0. MAYO.
Correlations for fitness between sibs and between parent and offspring at loci which affect
fitness are considered and discussed.
A Comparison of some Properties of Human Red Cell Acid Phosphatase in different Phenotypes by
JILL E. LUFFMAN and HARRY HARRIS.
The biochemical properties of red cell acid phosphatase in different phenotypes are compared and contrasted.

The Inheritance of Liability to Diseases with variable Age of Onset, with particular reference to Diabetes Mellitus by D. S. FALCONER.
A method of analysing familial data proposed in a previous paper is extended to diseases with variable age of onset, and is applied to published data on diabetes mellitus. It is concluded that the heritability of liability to diabetes decreases with increasing age, largely due to an increase of environmental variation. It is also concluded that cases with early onset are genetically different from cases with late onset.
Matched Pairs and Randomization Sets by F. N. DAVID and P. J. KIM. A new randomization test is proposed for analysing multidimensional matched-pair data,
and is applied to some intelligence test data.
Column Chromatograpy of Human Red Cell Acid Phosphatase by D. A. HOPKINSON and HARRY
HARRIS.
The five common phenotypes of human red cell acid phosphatase were examined by ionexchange chromatography. It is concluded that two main isoenzymes are present in each of the three postulated homozygous types, which differ from each other in net charge.
A Study of Defective Colour Vision with the Ishihara Test Plates by G. J. GORRELL. A survey of a hospital population failed to reveal any association between colour blindness
and alcoholism or cirrhosis.
X-Linked Cataract by M. FRACCARO, G. MORONE, U. MANFREDINI and RUTH SANGER. A pedigree of cataract is described which is thought likely to be sex-linked, but which could
be due to an autosomal, sex-limited gene.
Down's Syndrome at Young Maternal Age: Cytogenetical and genealogical study of eighty-one families by MARGARETA MIKKELSEN.
Cytogenetical and genealogical data are presented for 100 children with Down's syndrome born to mothers under thirty.
The Relation of Ethnic and Selected Socio-economic Factors to Human Birth-weight by ALFRED F.
NAYLOR and NTINOS C. MYRIANTHOPOULOS.
The effects of several socio-economic factors on the birth weight of White, Negro and Puerto Rican babies in the United States are described and discussed.
A Theoretical Approach to the Study of Genetic Parameters of Histocompatibility in Man by
G. LUNGHI.
The author maintains that his model of histocompatibility, proposed in 1965, is the same as that presented by Serra and O'Mathuna in the following year.

EUGENICS QUARTERLY
March 1967, Vol. 14, No. 1. Taste Sensitivity to Phenylthiocarbamide of Korean Population by YUNG SUN KANG, WAN KYOO
CHO and KEUN SUNG YURN.
Very careful examinations for PTC taste sensitivity and thresholds were made on 403 males and 368 females since non-tasters "are affected by a simple autosomal recessive gene", and the frequency ofnon-tasters varies "considerably among races and ethnic groups". These facts prompted this investigation into the hereditary characters of the population of the Korean peninsula, situated as it is between China and Japan.
Red/Green Color Blindness in the Niger Delta by D. F. ROBERTS. This paper studies the frequencies of this type of colour blindness in two African populations
of the Niger Delta and discusses various hypotheses for the differences and similarities.

Changes in Age at Marriage of Females and Their Effect on the Birth Rate in India by K. G.
BASAVARAJAPPA and M. I. BELVALGIDAD.
The Times ofIndia recently carried an editorial asking the Government to consider raising the legal age of marriage to nineteen for females and twenty-one for males with a view to reducing fertility. The joint authors of this paper examine the question very closely and conclude that the proposed measure would prove ineffective.
Social and Economic Characteristics of Aged Persons (65 years old and over) in the United States in 1960 by MARIA DAVIDSON.
Based on the data derived from the 1960 Census, this paper investigates the changes "that occurred in the labor force participation, occupational groups, earning, and physical mobility among persons of 65 years and over as compared with younger age groups".
Attitudes of Parents of Retarded Children Toward Voluntary Sterilization by MEDORA S. BASS. The chief lesson to be learned from this investigation of 132 parents of retarded children is
that the primary obstacle is simple ignorance-and the need is for the basic facts to be more readily available.
Techniques of Stratified Sampling in the Study of Variation of the Human Sex Ratio by M ARIAN NE F.
BERNSTEIN.
Evidence is presented to show that the technique of stratified sampling is essential in studying
genetic, environmental and anthropological causes of sex ratio variation.
Family Size in the 1960s-A Baffling Fad? by JUDITH B LAKE. A growing belief that-far from a population explosion-the United States crude birth rate
is declining receives in this paper a careful scientific analysis. Actual figures give only very slight confirmation of the belief.

of the island of Tongariki. Chemical investigation revealed difference in the a-chain, summarised
as x2115A1aAsPfl2. The origin of the variant is discussed.
Genetics of the Dombrock Blood Group System by PATRICIA TIPPETT. Tests with anti-Doa on 755 unrelated people of Northern European ancestry are reported.
The corresponding gene frequencies are: Doa =0 420; Do =0-580 The antigen Doa behaved as a dominant character in 201 Northern European families with
573 children and in 76 Israeli families with 224 children. The locus responsible for the Dombrock system was found not to be closely linked to the loci responsible for the established blood group systems or to those for various biochemical characters of the blood.
Xg Blood Group Frequencies in Some Further Populations by WILLIAM J. DEWEY and JOSEPH D. MANN with the assistance of C. E. JACKSON, WILLIAM BOUMAN, H. SAMUEL NOORDHOFF,
T. C. WU and HARVEY DOORENBOS.
The frequency of the blood types in the Xg system has now been studied in a number of populations. The published frequency data are summarized. Intergroup differences exist, but in all populations so far studied both alleles are found with relatively high frequencies.
Endemic Goitre in Greece: A Study of 379 Twin Pairs by B. MALAMOS, D. A. KOUTRAS, P. KOSTAMIS,
G. A. RIGOPOULOS, N. S. ZEREFOS and X. A. YATAGANAS.
In 109 villages in the endemic goitre areas of Greece, 379 twin pairs were examined for the presence of goitre. Monozygotic pairs showed a statistically significant higher concordance rate than did dizygotic. It is concluded that heredity plays a role in predisposition.
Agar Diffusion Test for Serum Cholinesterase Typing and Influence of Temperature on Dibucaine and Fluoride Numbers by GEORGE LEE and J. C. ROBINSON.
The results in the cholinesterase typing of 392 plasmas by the agar diffusion test were fully confirmed by the spectrophotometric determination of dibucaine numbers. The main advantage of the agar diffusion test is the simplicity with which dibucaine variants can be detected. 1; this case the test was of no value in detecting the UF phenotype. The dibucaine number and the fluoride number were found to be inverse functions of temperature. The change in fluoride number per degree was roughly four times as great as the change in dibucaine number. Furthermore, the magnitude of the change of the fluoride number with temperature was greater with the U than with the UF plasmas. By using the spectrophotometric method, the distinction between U and I dibucaine variants was apparent at 26°C., but the U and UF groups could not be clearly separated. Since previous investigators have determined fluoride numbers at 21-25°C., and since the distinction between U and UF is less marked when fluoride numbers are determined at raised temperatures, this failure to distinguish clearly these phenotypes may be related to the temperature effect.
Myotonic Dystrophy and Polycystic Disease of the Kidneys by A. E. H. EMERY, S. OLEESKY and R. T.
WILLIAMS.
A family with myotonic dystrophy is described in which three affected sibs also had polycystic
disease of the kidneys. Apparently this association has not been described previously.
Age, Sex, and ABO Blood Group Distributions of 150 Patients with Cerebral Arteriovenous Aneurysms by R. R. STRANG.
The age, sex, and ABO blood group distributions of 150 patients with an intracerebral arteriovenous aneurysm have been analysed. These lesions are most frequent in males (57 per cent). A verified diagnosis is most commonly made between the ages of twenty and forty-nine years in males, and between thirty and thirty-nine years in females. The ABO blood distribution showed a
significant reduction of Group A (X2=9X86; p< 002).
Transferrin Variants in Greeks by B. ANGELOPOULOS, A. KALOS and E. DANOPOULOS. Transferrin variants were studied by the vertical method of starch gel electrophoresis in 2050
Greek adults: 2041 were of the phenotype CC, six ofthe phenotype CD1, and three of the phenotype CB2. In the Greek population, the frequency of gene C is 0-9978, of gene D, it is 0-0015, and of gene B2 it is 0 0007. 292

Experimental Red Cell Chimerism in the Heterozygote (W'w) of the W-Series Mutants in the House Mouse by MARY J. SELLER.
Foetal liver cells from either of two haematologically normal strains of mice (A and CBA) were injected at birth into slightly anaemic animals of the genotype Wvw. When adult, these animals had a peripheral blood picture which was typical of the normal donor strain. The electrophoretic pattern of the haemoglobins of both the treated series of Wvw animals was of the diffuse, 2-banded type, of the CBA and A donor strains, instead of the usual single pattern of the W-series. It is implied that donor haematopoietic tissue has implanted and is functioning normally in the anaemic animals.
Presumptive Y/D Translocation in Mixed Gonadal Dysgenesis by D ANIEL D. FEDERMAN, FRANK M.
DAVIDOFF and EILEEN OUELLETTE.
A twenty-three-year-old chromatin negative woman with mixed gonadal dysgenesis is reported. Cytogenetic study of six tissues showed a modal number of forty-five with karyotype mosaicism, some cells being XO and others interpreted as showing a Y/D translocation. Clinical investigations are fully reported.
Comparison of Mitotic Growth Rates of Human Capillary Whole Blood Cultured in a Variety of Media by NUTAN P. BISHUN.
Three microblood cultures were set up from each of fifty-five subjects, using differing cultural conditions, and mitotic indices determined. It was shown that the bloods cultured in AB serum and T.C.199 gave a significantly higher growth rate (measured by the mitotic index) than those cultured in AB serum, T.C.199, and C.E.E. (chick embryo extract) or T.C.199 alone.
A comprehensive review article on Human Polymorphism by J. PRICE.
June 1967, Vol. 4, No. 2. Hydronephrosis in Mouse, Rat, and Man by MARGARET E. WALLACE and s. G. SPICKETT.
Hereditary hydronephrosis is described in the mouse, the rat and man. In the mouse, the differing incidence in different strains is described and its genetic significance in aetiology discussed. The two types of hydronephrosis, with and without ureteric obstruction, are described, as are their causes and genetic significance. The sex difference of both the incidence and severity of the lesion and its relationship to the genetic strain is also discussed. In the rat strain studied, hydronephrosis is almost limited to the male, generally affecting the right kidney. The mode of inheritance is uncertain. The pattern of sex-limitation and symmetry in mouse is similar to that among cases of urogenital malformations in man which are associated with external ear deformity. This suggests pleiotropy of a single gene in both species, the gene in each species having somewhat similar action. The mechanism of hydronephrosis in man and in mouse is discussed. Comparisons indicate that experiments with mice may aid elucidation of cause and control in man.
Hypoplastic Left Heart Complex by EVA D. ALBERMAN, JEAN M. FEDRICK and W. H. SCHUTT. Birth weight, length of gestation, associated malformations and parental age were documented
for fifty cases of hypoplastic left heart complex. The children were either stillborn or died in the neonatal period. It is considered that this complex is a heterogeneous group with one subgroup, interruption of the aorta, contrasting sharply with the others in sex and parental age distribution. In this sample, a feature of the remaining cases, particularly those with aortic valve obstruction uncomplicated by other types of cardiac or extracardiac malformation, was a high mean parental age. The relevance of such a finding is briefly discussed.
High Incidence of Haemoglobin GAccra in a Rural District in Jamaica by P. F. MILNER The finding of Hb GAccra in 2-3 per cent of a rural population in Jamaica is reported. This
haemoglobin has only once been reported before, this in an African family. The present finding of a high incidence is attributed to inbreeding in a relatively static community.
Chromosomes of Human Endometrium by C. ELIZABETH BOWEY and A. I. SPRIGGS. The chromosome complements oftwenty-two specimens ofnon-malignant human endometrium
are described. A direct technique was used. The chromosome number was found to be forty-six. Where karyotyping was possible, a normal karyotype was found.

Serum Alkaline Phosphatase Typs in North American Indians and Negroes by J. C. ROBINSON, C.
LEVENE, B. S. BLUMBERG and J. E. PIERCE.
Serum alkaline phosphatase variations were examined by starch gel electrophoresis on three populations: Montagnais and Naskapi Indians, and Sapelo Island Negroes. The action of neuraminidase on the phosphatase bands is presented, and .the presence of a pregnancy band was demonstrated in ten of the persons investigated from the Montagnais and Naskapi. The frequency of phosphatase 2 (Pp 2) was 719 per cent in the Montagnais, 68-6 per cent in the Naskapi, and 63-3 per cent in the Sapelo Island Negroes. The association with ABO blood groups and ABH secretor phenotypes is described. The non-association with other blood groups and with the Gc serum groups is also noted.
Blood Groups and Leprosy by FRANCISCO M. SALZANO. Data concerning the incidence of blood groups and leprosy obtained in many countries have
been pooled and analysed. In this very large series, there is no indication of any differential susceptibility to leprosy, or its forms, amongst the various ABO and Rh phenotypes.
Leprosy and ABO Blood Groups by GURMOHAN SINGH and DIVAKAR OJHA. ABO blood groups were studied in 633 leprosy patients and compared with 2,583 controls.
No relationship between blood groups and susceptibility to the disease, or type of the disease, was found.
Combination of Spherocytosis and a Variant of Beta Thalassaemia ('Isolated Raised Hb A2') by
T. A. CUNNINGHAM and F. VELLA.
A case report is presented of a male Jordanian of Syrian origin in whom the combination of spherocytosis and a beta thalassaemia variant (isolated raised haemoglobin A2 level) occurred. This is the first description of this combination of hereditary intrinsic abnormalities of the erythrocyte. There was no evidence of interaction between the two genes. The genetic combination was asymptomatic and was discovered during routine pre-operative investigation.
Ovarian Dysgerminoma in Three Generations? by STEWAR T M. JACKSON. A Jamaican family with members of three generations developing ovarian tumours, two of
whom were known to have had dysgerminomas, is reported. The possibility of this being a random association is discussed.
A Familial Variant Chromosome in the 13-15 Group by PATRICIA M. LORD and PATRICIA COOKE. An easily distinguished variant chromosome in the thirteen to fifteen group is described in
tissues from a phenotypically normal father and daughter. Measurements of the abnormal chromosome and their use in positioning chromosomes within their group is discussed.
Ring Chromosome 18 in a Patient with Multiple Anomalies by CATHERINE G. PALMER, NUZHAT
FAREED and A. DONALD MERRITT.
A ten-year-old boy with multiple congenital abnormalities and a ring chromosome 18 is described. The findings of other patients with ring chromosome 18 are summarized and compared with the present patient and with the two syndromes manifested by deletions of the long or short arm of chromosome 18. The patient had characteristics of both syndromes, thus suggesting the loss of segments of both long and short arms.
Chromosome Mosaicism in a Mentally Retarded Mother and Her Daughter by CARMEN B. LOZ ZIO,
GUILLERMO R. JAUREGUI, JUAN C. SCORNAVACHI and MIGUEL A. GAMBIN.
Mosaicism 46/47 was observed in a mentally retarded girl seventeen years old, and in her mother, who was also mentally deficient. The girl presented with obesity, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. Increased serotonin levels were found in the blood, but decreased excretion of 5-OH indolacetic acid was demonstrated in the urine. The mother was also obese and exhibited low 5-OH indolacetic acid excretion. Two other sibs were mentally retarded but were not studied cytogenetically. The karyotypes of the mother, studied in blood culture, and the chromosomes of the daughter, obtained from one bone-marrow and two blood cultures, showed a normal cell line and one trisomic for a small acrocentric chromosome. The extra chromosome appeared to be, morphologically, one of group G (21-22). The cytogenetic findings and the phenotypic expression are dis-

cussed. It is concluded from this that the additional chromosome is unlikely to be either a chromosome 21 or 22 or a Y chromosome or a deleted X chromosome. The most probable explanation is that it is a centric fragment of another autosome.

A Patient with 45XO/48XYYY Mosaicism by DAVID COX and C. L. BERRY. A male pseudohermaphrodite with hypospadias, a uterus with blindly-ending Fallopian tubes,
and a single testis on the right side is described. He is of normal intelligence and his height and weight are at the sixth centile. Chromosome analysis revealed an XO/XYYY mosaic sex chromosome pattern.

Trisomy Di (13-15) Associated with XO/XY Mosaicism by N. E. FRANCE, P. G. H. EVISON, L. J.

BUTLER, G. J. A. I. SNODGRASS, L. CROME and C. G. KEITH.

A male child is described with congenital malformations which are commonly associated with

the trisomy D1 (13-15) syndrome. In addition, a sacral meningomyelocele and an Arnold-Chiari

malformation were present. The external genitalia were hypoplastic, there was a rudimentary

uterus, and the gonads were absent. Cytogenetic studies revealed seven chromosomes in group D

(13-15) representing probable trisomy 13. In addition, sex chromosome mosaicism of the type

XO/XY was demonstrated. The major anomalies, including ocular defects and intersexuality, are

discussed in relation to the chromosomal findings.

POPULATION STUDIES
July 1967, Vol. 21, No. 1. Fertility Differentials as Evidence of Incipient Fertility Decline in a Developing Country. The Case of Ghana by J. C. CALDWELL.
This paper is concerned mainly with the analysis of fertility on the basis of the 1960 Census data. The author finds a significant difference in the experience of the towns and the countryside, even after making allowance for the special difficulties of interpretation in this respect which are present in Ghana. Dr. Caldwell finds some small evidence of birth control, but attributes the urbanrural differential mainly to later marriage in the towns. Nevertheless, both causes of lower urban fertility are associated with better education, and other factors, which lead the author to suggest that the small decline so far is the precursor of a more general fall yet to come.
Frequency and Tining of Intercourse: Its Relation to the Probability of Conception
by P. A. LACHENBRUCH. A new mathematical model, evaluated on a computer. The main variables are a probability
distribution for the day of ovulation, length of fertile period and patterns of intercourse, including ways of using the rhythm method of control.
Reconstruction of Fertility Trends for the Female Population of the USSR by D. PETER MAZUR. Owing to lack of data this study is admittedly speculative, but it applies a generation approach
in an attempt to make a more realistic appraisal than can be provided by secular analysis. The author suggests that cohort fertility is higher in the USSR than in the USA, although secular variations have been more pronounced in Russia than in America.
Life and Death in the Sixteenth Century in the City of York by URSULA M. COWGILL. Analysis of the parish records shows that births had a marked seasonal distribution and that
both the sexes had the same mortality rates. Only about one-half of babies survived the first year of life.
A Probability Model Applicable to the Study of Inter-Live Birth Intervals and Random Segments of the Same by L. SRINIVASAN.
This presents the parameters of a simple model derived under a set of realistic assumptions. It is designed for use in testing the results of sample surveys into fertility. Birth intervals are considered in two forms: (i) time elapsing between one birth and another, and (ii) number of years and months between time of latest birth and time of survey.

THE EUGENICS REVIEW Fertility Differences in Andean Countries: A Reply to W. H. James by DAVID M. HEER.
Following earlier articles by James and Heer, the author agrees that James's explanation of fertility differences between areas of Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador is sound. James attributed the lower fertility of the Indian-speaking areas than that of the Spanish-speaking areas to altitude. Heer admits that this is a more valid explanation than some other factors that Heer had mentioned.
