GERMAN POPULATION MOVEMENTS
And Some Comparisons with Those of Other Countries By Dr. CHRISTOPH TIETZE

In sendinig this article, Dr. Tietze asked us to add, wherever possible, comparable English figures. This we have done, taking them from the current Statistical Review* of the Registrar-General. But the Christmas posts considerably delayed the arrival of
the article from Vienna, and there was, therefore, not time to add such figures as had to be sought elsewhere. Our additions are set in italic type.-ED.

IT is not such a long time since the TABLE I.-BIRTH RATES SINCE I900.

German birth rate was one of the highest in Europe. The workers and peasants of the Reich had large families, to the great distress of the politicians and military men of France. During the second half of the nineteenth century the average birth rate was nearly 37 [per i,ooo living: in England 33.4]. There was a slight 'peak ' in the
seventies with the figure of 40.9 in I876 [In England the peak of 36.4 was reached in 1876], due to the rise in industrialism in the newly-founded Empire; but natality
soon returned to the norm. In i9oo the
birth rate was still above 35 [in England 28.7] Then a decline began, which soon could be called a fall. At the outbreak of the War the figure was 27 [in England 23.I]. After the War this rate was never reached again, .and the fall continued more rapidly than before [as in England]. Today the birth rate of Germany has nearly caught up that of France, which is now a fairly stationary one. Table i compares the
development of both rates during the twentieth century, and Table 2 (overleaf)
gives the balance of births and deaths since
the beginning of registration. Comparing these figures, we have to bear
in mind that the French birth rate was raised materially by the incorporation of

Alsace-Lorraine, and that the German terntories ceded to Poland had a very high natality. But, on the other hand, we must not forget that the German population con-
tains an extraordinarily high proportion of women of child-bearing age. If, therefore,
we relate the number of births, not to the general population, but to the number of
women between I5 and 45 or between IS and
5o, we find that the French birth rate is about io per cent. higher than the German.
A very accurate method of comparing the natality of different countries and periods
has been introduced by R. R. Kuczynsli. His " gross reproduction rate " compen-
sates for differences in the sex and age constitution, and permits us to calculate the average number of girls born to each woman surviving the child-bearing period.
The number of children can be calculated

Mortality in Germany is very low to-day. In 1925 the expectation of life at birth was 56 years for bovs and 58 years, 8 months for girls [in England, boys 55.6, girls * Still-births excluded. t Present German territory.

59.6]* But that could not account for the death rate of I2 per i,ooo that has obtained during the last few years [in England ii.6 tO 12.3 per i,ooo]. The real cause for such a low rate-which would correspond to an average duration of life of more than eighty years-can only be found in an abnormal age constitution. There are few children and an excess of persons in middle life. This makes the natality appear deceptively high and the mortality deceptively low. Dr. Burgdorfer, from- the statistical office in Berlin, gives the following figures for the
year 1927: Germany England

The present increase of the population is
only a mechanical one, being due to the
abnormal age constitution. A dynamic increase does not exist any more. The balance of births and deaths has become negative in Germany, as is also shown by Kuczynski's " net reproduction rate." It is now below zero in all the great countries of Western Europe, but in France it is higher than in Germany or England.

The population of Germany will probably continue to increase until about I950, when the age composition will be abnormal in another way. There will be few middleaged persons and many old people. The
death rate must rise; and the population will

as a brake on the declining birth rate; but it causes death or lifelong sickness to thousands of women every year, and brings mental and moral distress upon a still greater number. In Russia, where abortions are legalized and performed under sanitary conditions in the State hospitals, their number shows no tendency to increase, but health conditions and mortality have been considerably improved.
The abortion problem cannot, of course, be solved by mere legalization. The interruption of pregnancy, the killing of the unborn foetus, has to be made an unnecessary procedure by systematic care for mothers and children-a difficult task under present social and economic conditions-and by contraception propaganda. Efforts to advance in both ways are being made in Germany; and one may hope that the number of abortions has already reached its
