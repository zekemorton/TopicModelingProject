GENETIC-HYGIENIC EXPERIENCES IN DENMARK IN RECENT YEARS*
By TAGE KEMP, M.D.
University Institute for Human Genetics, Copenhagen

E UGENICS had begun to develop before the rediscovery of Mendel's laws in the year I900.
In I883 Francis Galton first formulated the principles of eugenics. Galton was fully aware that at that time the possibilities of practising eugenic theories were small, since little was known then of hereditary conditions in man. He therefore started comprehensive family studies and was the first to undertake systematic twin investigations. As, however, the basic genetic laws were not yet known, he did not reach far by these studies, and eugenics consequently remained mainly speculative.
Galton himself wrote the following about eugenics:
Eugenics is the science which deals with all influences that improve the inborn qualities of a race; also those that develop them to the utmost advantage. What is meant by improvement? There is considerable difference between goodness in the several qualities and in that of the character as a whole. The character depends largely on the proportion between qualities whose balance may be much influenced by education. We must therefore leave morals as far as possible out of the discussion, not entangling ourselves with the almost hopeless difficulties they raise as to whether a character as a whole is good or bad. Moreover, the goodness or badness of character is not absolute, but relative to the current form of civilization.
Positive eugenics meets with almost insuperable difficulties. Superman cannot be artificially produced. Marriage and reproduction cannot be carried through by compulsion. Indirectly positive eugenic policies have been pursued, and perhaps not unsuccessfully, but we cannot with certainty characterize the ends gained this

way. as an advantage to humanity. Accord-
ingly no detailed account will be given of
positive eugenics either.
Negative eugenics arose nearly seventy years ago in connection with the great progress made in natural science by the end of the nineteenth century,: with a direct bearing on Darwin's theory of evolution and as a consequence of this.
However, by the time the concept of eugenics was formed the conditions for its practical employment were not yet present. Nearly fifty years elapsed before medical genetics, in connection with the introduction of modern biological genetics, had reached such a development that it could form a basis for eugenic measures being carried out.
The correct use of eugenics was not recognized for the first fifty years after its" introduction.
From the outset it was associated with an idea that particularly valuable families exist whose propagation ought to be encouraged. These ideas, marked by the English thought of " the fit contra the unfit " and of " the good human stocks" were rather obscure, though in the main harmless. In America, on the other hand, the first development of eugenics was associated with an idea of the existence of particularly harmful and dangerous families, who are very expensive to society; here, therefore, the aim of eugenics became that of sparing society this expense.
In Germany eugenics underwent a more disastrous development with its unrealistic ideas of superman and worthless racial elements, a development which ended in catastrophe.
To our knowledge eugenics has not yet obtained a footing in Eastern Europe,

Sterilization
In Europe sterilization laws have existed since I929. They were first introduced in the Canton of Waadt in Switzerland, and later in the same year in Denmark. Then followed Norway- -I934), Sweden (I935,
revised I94I), Finland (i935), and Iceland
(I938). In Germany (from I934) and Esthonia they have had sterilization laws which probably are no longer in force. In other countries, such as England, Holland, Hungary, Czecho-Slovakia, and Poland, sterilization laws have been considered, but not carried through.
In I95I sterilization laws are thus found in all the Scandinavian countries.

Induced Abortion
Nearly 2,300 years ago Plato mentioned the possibility of induced abortion for eugenic reasons. His proposal passed unnoticed, however. In I939 Denmark, Iceland and Sweden introduced laws permitting induced abortion on eugenic grounds. In I950 similar laws were introduced in Finland.
In Denmark about 5,000 legal induced abortions have been performed yearly for the last five to ten years, a large proportion of the operations have been carried out entirely or in part on eugenic grounds, at a rough estimate I,000-2,000 cases a year; of these foetuses perhaps about ioo would have been mental defectives.

TABLE 3 6I3 STERILIZED FEEBLE-MINDED PATIENTS, I950-1954

Table i shows as mentioned a number of legal sterilizations in Denmark during twenty-five years. During the first decade
the average number of sterilizations was about I50 a year because the legislation was new and was being tried out. In the next decade the average number was about
three times as high, and during the last five-year period the number has still been increasing. In Table 2 the number of sterili-
zations has been divided into two groups, one including feeble-minded exclusively and one counting all other diagno'ses. It might be noted that the number of feeble-minded sterilized per year has been somewhat lesser
during the last five-year period. But the number of other diagnoses has on the other hand increased. It is partly because the number of feeble-minded who merit sterilization has now reached a certain level where only patients from one age-group have to be sterilized, and partly because the definition of feeble-mindedness has changed during recent years and several mild cases have been moved from the category " feebleminded " to the category " other diseases."

Table 3 shows the age distribution of the sterilized feeble-minded during the last fiveyear period. As it is seen the greatest frequency appears in the age-group 20-24 for men as well as for women. The average age on the whole is a little smaller for women than for men.

Genetic-Hygienic Ascertainment
An important aid to the carrying through of genetic-hygienic measures is the establishment of a genetic-hygienic registration comprising as far as possible a complete register or card-index, continually brought up to date, of all the patients with severe hereditary diseases within the country and also their families.
A registration of this kind can be useful in many ways in connection with genetichygienic questions. If in a given case the question of genetic-hygienic measures is raised, the card-index will furnish information about the person or persons in question and their families. It will thus be easier to give advice in many cases.

GENETIC-HYGIENIC EXPERIENCES IN DENMARK

I5

In Denmark a genetic-hygienic register, a medico-genetic ascertainment, was established in I938 and is kept at the University Institute for Human Genetics in Copenhagen. This register is continually brought up to date covering so far as possible all the patients with severe hereditary diseases within the country.
A physician who is to make a genetic prognosis must, of course, procure information on the hereditary taint in the family. Not all physicians have realized this fact. For a proper genetic prognosis it is, however, absolutely necessary that the physician takes the, sometimes very great, trouble of procuring this information. The task of the physician in this connection is in the first instance to make a genetic prognosis for the offspring of a person or a married couple, in cases where information is available on diseases in one or both parents and in their families. It is not always possible to give a definite percentage figure for the chances that a child in whose family a certain hereditary disease occurs will inherit this
disease.
The physician is frequently asked about the advisability of having children by patients with some hereditary taint or other. These questions may often be difficult to answer. In Denmark the genetic-hygienic register at the University Institute for Human Genetics, Copenhagen, is often consulted by physicians, practising physicians, specialists or physicians connected with institutions or hospitals. Then the institute procures information on the family and answers the prognostic question as well as possible. The card-index may furnish information about the persons in question and their families; studies at the same time constitute a starting point for medico-genetic studies of the various diseases, which form the necessary basis for all genetic-hygienic activity.
During the period I939-I956 (Table 4) the Institute for Human Genetics received nearly II,403 inquiries concerning genetichygienic problems (including legal abortion, sterilization and genetic counselling).

The effect of this negative selection will depend on the way mental defectiveness is inherited. Some cases are now hereditary, some are typically dominant, others typical recessive and others again follow a more complicated inheritance. (See Tables 6, 7 and 8.)

Many varied circumstances, for instance the mutation frequency, have to be taken into consideration in judging the effect of sterilization, etc., on the transmission of hereditary diseases.
Furthermore there are the effects of assortative mating, isolates and other factors active in population genetics.
The effect of the various degrees of negative selection-ioo per cent, 50 per cent, I0 per cent, etc.-against dominant and recessive character-carriers, can be seen from the respective curves (vide T. Kemp: Genetics and Disease, I95I, Edinburgh and London, pages II3-I20).
In this connection new knowledge about the possibility of diagnosing the heterozygotes by recessive diseases may be of importance in the future and the same holds true with regard to linkage between marker-genes and hereditary diseases.
The evaluation of the effect of eugenic measures must take place on the basis of comprehensive and thorough medico-genetical investigations and genetic-hygienic ascertainment.
Conclusions
To judge from theoretical calculations, the negative selection, which can be effected by moderate genetic-hygienic measures, may probably cause a considerable fall in the incidence of the hereditary diseases in the population. This incidence depends, however, on so many different factors that the stated calculations are of limited value.
A definite opinion on the genetic-hygienic possibilities can only be formed on the basis of empirical material. Procuring of such material requires an epidemiological control of the serious hereditary diseases in the

I8 rHE EUGENICS REVIEW

various populations, carried through for several generations. We can thereby ascertain whether the hereditary diseases decrease or increase in frequency, and whether the genetic-hygienic measures are employed to a suitable extent and on the diseases where
such are needed.
During the past fifty years or so the study of heredity, and in particular human genetics, has undergone a development which has added largely to our knowledge of this subject. If this development continues the time draws near when man to an increasing extent can control his own biological evolution and at the same time command his environments and conditions of life.
Genetic hygiene, in the form it has assumed in Denmark during the past few decades, must be regarded as a precursor, or perhaps rather as a first stage of this development.

Genetic hygiene is here based on the principle of voluntariness, and the population has learned to understand its purpose. Democratic social conditions prevent misuse and secure that due consideration is paid
to personal liberty. The high standard of the public health
service and social care at the same time constitute a basis for genetic-hygienic measures and are necessary for their effective
application. Medical genetics in connection with the
associated advice and registration create the necessary scientific foundation for carrying out measures aimed at preventing
hereditary diseases. The increasing occurrence of artificially
induced mutations during coming years will make an epidemiological control of the hereditary diseases in the populations still
more important.
