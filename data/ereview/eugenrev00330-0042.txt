STUDIES IN HEREDITARY ABILITY.
BY MR. W. T. J. GUN.
[NoTE. In the accompanying charts all persons, the dates of whose
births and deaths are given, appear in the Dictionary of National Biography, referred to in the article as D.N.B. A fewv so marked are still living, but will undoubtedly find a place in future issues of D.N.B.].
It is proposed in this article, which is confined to families of British origin, to deal more particularly with descents through female lines, which, in comparison with direct male descents, are apt to be overlooked. A certain number of tables in this connection were drawn up by the late Sir Francis Galton in his "Hereditary Genius," but in very few instances did he trace out all possible connections of note. The writer has compiled a large number of charts, wbich it is hoped may supplement Galton's researches, some of these charts are appended hereto, a selection having been made from those connections which were little, if at all, touched on by Sir Francis. Mention in D.N.B. has been taken as a rough test of ability, but it is fully recognised that some individuals so mentioned owed their position miore to extrinsic circumstances than to intrinsic qualities and must be admitted to tables of ability with extreme caution.
From the various charts compiled the writer has endeavoured to ascertain whether ability is on the whole more likely to descend through the father or through the mother; the test from D.N.B. would certainly seem to indicate paternal predominance, but having regard to the advantages accruing to the male line, famlily influence arid tradition, the very name itself, it seems probable that such predominance, if it really exists at all, is very slight.
Taking English history as a whole, there seems little doubt that among distinct family connections, the greatest number of noteworthy names occur among the descendants of Sir William Sidney, father of thie well-known Sir Henry, and grandfather of the still better known Sir Philip; and among the descendants of Sir George Villiers, the father of James the Firs-Ps favourite, Buckingham.
Each of these two connections, the Sidney and the Villiers, contains well over one hundred names mentioned separately in D.N.B. The Sidney connection has been to a certain extent dealt with by Galton, "Hereditary Genius," p. 83, but be altogether overlooked the Villiers connection, the most noteworthy names in which will be found in Chart 1, descendants of Sir George Villiers by his first wife, Audrey Sanders, and in Chart 2 descendants of the same by his second wife, Mary Beaumont. The most famous individuals noted are the first Duke of Marlborough, the Duke of Berwick, Lord Chatham and his son William Pitt, Charles James Fox, the brothers Sir Charles and Sir William Napier, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, Henry Fielding and Lord Castlereagh. In later times four Prime Ministers belonged also to this connection, Lord John Russell, Lord Aberdeen, Lord Derby and Lord Salisbury.
From Chart 1 it will be observed that although the greatest names

do not occur till the 18th century, there was much ability in the 17th, though this ability was not of a very distinguished kind, being chiefly in fact the power of attracting monarchs! In addition to Buckingham himself, Barbara Villiers Duchess of Cleveland, Arabella Churchill, and Elizabeth Villiers Countess of Orkney, were mistresses of suecessive kings, Charles II, James II, and William III. This hereditary power of charming was very evident later in Marlborough, and to a certain extent also in Chatham, who it will be noted was doubly descended from Sir George Villiers. Pride and haughtiness, so strongly exhibited in the notorious Barbara Villiers were very characteristc of the Pitts, and also of Castlereagh, but reached their acme in Lady Hester Stanhope, coupled with a marked eccentricity, noticeable also in the selfish voluptuary, the third Marquis of Hertford, the original of Thackeray's Lord Steyne, and to an extreme extent in the Ilervey family, whose individualities were so marked that Lady Mary
Montagu said of them " the world consists of men, women and 1l.erveys." This eccentricity, together with much ability, descended from the Herveys to the Stanleys of Alderley, coming down to very
recent times. Ability, after lying dormant for some time, re-appeared in the
male line of the Villiers family in the well-known Foreign Secretary
of last century, the 4th Earl of Clarendon, and in several of his imnmediate relatives. It is interesting to note that this particular family descended also from Edward Hyde, the great Lord Clarendon of that family, and in the direct female line from the latter's great
enemy, Oliver Crornwell. This is almost a unique case of a family of distinction in the 19th century, with so many ancestcrs of note in the 17th, and so little apparent ability in the intervening period.
Powers of command coupled with powers of charm were perhaps the most salient features of the Villiers connection, but the ability displayed was obviously very varied, and becomes still more marked when we include the descendants of the second family, set out in Chart 2, when we can add to Lord Hervey the memxioir writer, the greater writer of the same style, Lady Mary, the novelist Henry
Fielding, and the historian, Sir William Napier, a galaxy of firstclass literary talent, while powers of charm reached their acme in Charles Fox.
In the second family, however, there is a greater lack of continuity of ability than in the first, and Lady Mary and Fielding)ossibly owe their powers more to other descents. Still more is this. possible in the case of the descendants of the 2nd Duke of Richmond, of whom Fox and the Napiers are the most prominent, as these belong also to another connection, the Waller, which is included in Chart 2. From two first cousins, Sir Hardress and Sir William Waller, both famous in the Civil Wars, sprang three lines of note. From Sir William, the Harcourt, subsequently Vernon-Harcourt line, from Sir Hardress the Petty-Fitzmaurices and the Richmond subconnection, and it will be seen that ability in each line persisted for several generations, particularly perhaps in the H1arcourts.
It is interesting to note that the very eugenic marriage of the 2nd Duke and Duchess of Richmond was arranged by the parents:

on each side when the parties were very young, to satisfy a gambling
debt. Lord March, as he then was, went abroad for some years, detesting the idea of the wife who had been forced upon him.
Returning, and going to the theatre, he was much attracted by a beautiful girl in a box, and enquired her name. He was informed that she was "the reigning toast, Lady March." He fell in love with his wife on the spot and they remained devoted for the rest of their lives. Her father, Lord Cadogan, was a distinguished general under Marlborough, and a line of military note can thus be traced from Waller through Cadogan to Napier.

After the third generation from the 2nd Duke and Duchess of

Richmond, the family ability certainly tended to lessen, but re-

appeared of late years in the persons of Mr. George Wyndham, of the

distingushed scientists the General Bruce, the leader

late and present Lords Rayleigh, and of
of the second Mount Everest expedition.

It is certainly a curious fact that Col. Howard-Bury, the leader of the

first expedition, should also belong to the Waller connection; the

relationship is, of course, far too distant to be nificance, except as illustrating the advantages

of of

any biological sig-
descent from good

stock.

In the Villiers and Waller connections we can only trace the

descent of ability in a rather general way, and more eugenic interest

attaches to the origin of the Spencer connection as set out in Chart

8, where the effect of a series of quite remarkably eugenic marriages

can be clearly seen. It will be noted that in six successive generations

of the male daughters of

line of the Spencer family, marriages took distinguished fathers. These fathers were as

34t EUGENICS REVIEW. Spencer and the 1st Earl Spencer, did little or nothing in themselves, but quite obvously passed on latent talent, for the descendants of the
1st harl Spencer can show an altogether exceptional family record. It must be admitted at once that no absolutely first-rate man was produced, but individuals of the second rank have been quite exceptionally numerous. In statesmanship three Earls Spencer, the 2nd Earl (Granville, who is said to have spoken French better than any other Englishman of his day, the 8th Duke of Devonshire, better known as Lord Hartington. In scholarship, the 4th Lord Lyttelton, who was senior classic, and Bishop Gore ; in athletics, in particular the present Lord Desborough and the late Mr. Alfred Lyttelton, as well as nearly all the other Lytteltons, perfect examples of "mens sana in corpore sano," several Ponsonbys and Mr. Spencer Gore, who won the first lawn tennis championship ever held.
Nor must the women of the connection be forgotten, the brilliant Duchess of Devonshire and her equally brilliant granddaughter, the Duchess of Sutherland, the eccentric, but in many ways able, Lady Caroline Lamb, and the aunt and niece, Henrietta, Countess of Bessborough and Sarah Lady Lyttelton, whose recently published letters show great literary gifts.
The Spencer connection demonstrates in the fullest degree the value of a good stock; the finest flower of English aristocracy, their
remarkable versatility is most clearly due to the very versatile ancestors from whom they all derive.
It will be observed that the Spencers belonged both to the
Villiers and to the Sidney connections, to the former through the Duke of Marlborough, to the latter through the Earl of Leicester. The ability of the Sidney connection persisted in many different directions, and Chart 4 traces a line from Edmund Dudley to the present Lord Grey of Falloden, passing through seven distinct families, which in almost every generation shows one or more men of historic note. It must be allowed that in the case particularly of the Pelhams, actual ability is perhaps not very evident, but even these showed energy, and during a period of over four centuries, this line at least never became unimportant or commonplace.
Some connections of note in the 15th and ]6th centuries have been selected for Charts 5, 6 and 7.
Chart 5 shows the descent from the Wyatts of the Vanes and the Twysdens. Of the Wyatts the elder Sir Thomas was the most distinguished, a poet of great gifts, a scholar and a diplomatist, one of
the earliest examples of the notable all-round nmen of the 16th
century, so many of whom had relatives of distinction. The younger Sil Thomas is known in history for his romantic and ill-fated rising on behalf of Lady Jane Grey; Sir Francis, his much less-known grandson, was an early and on the whole successful governor of Virginia. Clearly, however, the ability of the first Sir Thomas descended most on the Vanes, father and son, though it took a very different form. The Twysdens were much less notable than the Vanes, but they were a very versatile family, Sir Roger, an historical Eiitiquary of note; Sir Thomas, a judge; John, a phvsician. These Twysdens were connected on the mother's side with the Finches,

that remarkable legal family referred to by Galton, "Hereditary
Genius," p. 84. James Ussher, the learned Archbishop of Armagh, perhaps the
greatest scholar of his time, is the central figure of Chart 6. It will
be seen that both his maternal grandfather, James Staneyhurst, recorder of Dublin, and his maternal grandson, James Tyrell, a
minor historical writer, achieved some note. This is one of the very few instances where a maternal grandfather, and again his maternal
grandfather, appears in D.N.B.; another instance will be found in
thc Pratt connection, hereafter referred to.
The descents exemplified by the St. Leger connection, Chart 7,
are of considerable interest, as though the individuials mentioned are
not on the whole celebrated, very varied abilities appeared. Arch-
bishop Warham was a great statesman and prelate, the St. Legers
were chiefly famed in arms, the ea'rlier Digges, Leonard and Thomas,
who had none of the St. Leger blood, were mathematicians. Of the later Digges who were descended from the St. Legers, Leonard was a poet and translator, Sir Dudlev a diplomiat and jiidge, the second Dudley a political writer. Literary talent was beginning to appear and is to be found again in the last Anthony Hammond and his son James. The Hammonds had, however, connections of distinction also on the paternal side, the scholar Thomas Stanley, and, more distantly, the poet Richard Lovelace, together with a direct descent from Edwin Sandys, Archbishop of York tenmp. Elizabeth, whose sons were notable colonial pioneers. On the whlole, therefore, it is perhaps remarkable that the Hammonds did not achieve more,
and it is to be observed that in the case of all these three connections, Wyatt, Ussher, St. Leger, ability seems ultimately to have become
extinct, no doubt through discontinuance of eugenic marriages.
So far the lines traced have been those of a common descent, but it is, of course, equally if not perhaps more interesting, to trace as far as possible the ancestry of well-known individuals in various
directions.
Chart 8 indicates some of the forebears of the famous Lord Chesterfield, best known by his letters, but no mean statesman, and perhaps the most typically polished man of the world of all time. There were many other notable Stanhopes in the male line, but these are rather distantly related to the letter writer, who owed his ability chiefly to the successive eugenic marriages of his great grandfather, his grandfather and his father. The first named, Henry Lord Stanhope, married the heiress of the Wotton family, herself a lady of strong character who played no small part in the civil wars. The Wottons were one of the most distinguished of the all-round families of Elizabethan times, particularly Sir Nicholas, a really great diplomatist, and Sir Henry, poet, ambassador and provost of Eton. The grandfather, the 2nd Farl of Chesterfield, married into the Dormer family, his wife's grandfather, the 1st Earl of Carnarvon, was a very gallant Cavalier, described by Clarendon "as of a very keen courage, an excellent discerner and presser of advantage over the enemy," and through this family a double descent can be traced from
the Sidneys, through the Herberts and the Montagus respectively.

86 EUGENICS REVIEW.
Even more remarkable, perhaps, was the descent derived by the great Lord Chesterfield from his mother, a daughter of that George Savile, Marquis of Halifax, so brilliantly portrayed by Macaulay as the ' Trimmer.' Chesterfield certainly derived many characteristics from this grandfather, who forestalled the grandson by writing "Letters of Advice to a Daughter," a work of interest, though not comparable to the later 'Letters.' Halifax's wife was a Pierrepont, her father was known as ' Wise William.' He was a great grandfather alike of Lord Chesterfield and Lady Mary Montagu, ,who were thus second cousins. Halifax himself had distinguished descent, his maternal great uncle was the famous Lord Strafford, of a character singular different to that of hiis great nephew, the one a typical extremist, the other a typical centre party man. On his mother's side Halfax derived from the Coventrys, a legal family of note.
It will be seen that Lord Chesterfield's ancestry was distinguished in almost every direction, and a careful analysis of the qualities of his ancestors shews clearly what were the makings of this brilliant man of the world. It is, however, interesting to note that his illegitimate son, for whom he cared so much, proved quite worthless and inherited none of the distinction of his paternal ancestors. In him the presumably indifferent maternal line must have been most unfortunately predominant. Lord Chesterfield's own father, too, with a great heredity
behind him, did nothing of any note, like the 1st Earl Spencer, his
role was merely that of a transmitter of great qualities. Lord John Russell furnishes the next example of notable ancestry.
Chart 9. As in the Spencer, so in the Russell family, successive marriages
in the male line of eugenic value occurred, though the fathers were on the whole of much less distinction. The first marriage to be noted, that of the daughter of the infamous Robert Carr, Earl of Somerset, and his even more infamous wife, can only have brought in a certain energy and push, but so far as can be traced no evil moral effect
persisted. William Lord Russell's admirable wife Rachel, came of
two distinguished stocks, the Wriothesleys and the Ruvignys, while the marriage of the 2nd Duke of Bedford with the granddaughter of Sir Josiah Child, the great East Indian magnate, is interesting as bringing in that commercial strain which helped to strengthen so many of the English governing families, even in their most aristocratic days. The 4th Duke's wife, herself a woman of strong character, was niece of Lady Mary Montagu. Their son, Lord Tavistock, married into the Keppels, a family of naval and military note, and through their mother belonging to the Villiers connection. Lord John Russell's own mother was a Byng, great granddaughter of a successful admiral and great niece of another admiral the unfortunate John Byng, who was far from sharing the success of his father. Her mother was a Boyle, a family which at an earlier date played many varied parts. It is interesting that Lord John, an aristocrat of aristocrats, derived also on the Byng side comnercial descent, from the rather obscure family of Daniel, who may well have been of Jewish origin.

STUDIES IN HEREDITARY ABILITY.

The later Russells in general have, like the Spencers, shewn much versatility; for example, the first Lord Ampthill an eminent diplomatist and his son a great oarsman, the present Duke of Bedford well known as a naturalist, Mr. George Russell a charming writer, and Mr. Bertrand Russell, mathematician and Socialist.
On the whole the Russell ability has been rather less than the Spencer, or at least less numerously diffused, just as the descent is on the whole not so distinguished.
A third example of brilliant heredity is furnished by Lord Haldane.
Both his grandfathers, John Haldane and Richard Burdon, were men of some mark. Strength of character seems chiefly to have distinguished the former, who left the navy to become a Congregational leader, intellect the latter, who did not, however, follow up a brilliant scholastic career, but his son, Sir John Burdon-Sanderson, achieved great note as a scientist. Lord Haldane's most famous relatives, however, are various great grand uncles :-Sir Ralph Abercromby, the general ; Viscount Duncan, the admiral, and the two great lawyers,
Lord Eldon and Lord Stowell. Nor is a commercial descent lacking in this case also, Sir John Sanderson, Richard Burdon's father-in-law,
having been a successful banker. In Lord Haldane's very varied career, almost all the activities of his relatives may at one time or another be traced.
He is not, it may be remarked, the only member of the present Government who clearly derives ability from his ancestors. Lord Parmoor is great nephew of Sir William Laurence, a very distinguished surgeon of his day; Mr. Trevelyan is, as is well known, great nephew of Lord Macaulay, in addition to his nearer relatives of note-; Mr.
Buxton, great grandson of the abolitionist, Sir Fowell Buxton, is also
great grand nephew of Mrs. Elizabeth Fry, and ultimately descended from Robert Barclay, the Apologist of the Quakers, though this last descent is, of course, too remote to have any biological significance. Colonel Wedgwood, descended from the great potter, and a cousin of the Darwins, is maternal grandson of an eminent engineer, James Meadowes Rendal. Lord Chelmsford is the son of a general and grandson of a Lord Chancellor. Mr. Ponsonby belongs to the Spencer connection.
There can be little doubt that similar ability existed among the ancestors of other members of the Government, though it was not sufficient to raise them to a considerable position in the world from the humbler walks of life in which they were born.
The last two Charts, 11 and 12, indicate the lines of descent from which the ability of the late Lord Salisbury and the ability of Lord Randolph Churchill were in all probability derived.
Nothing shews more clearly the undue emphasis laid on purely male line descents, owing to the similarity of name, than the often quoted descent of the Cecils from Lord Burleigh, and of the Churchills from the first Duke of Marlborough. The descent from Burleigh is certainly too remote -to be of biological import and that from Marlborough has probably little more value in this respect.
The connection indicated in Chart 11 between the Wellesley and

88 EUGENICS REVIEW.
Cecil families is possibly the origin of the ability of both. In her life of her father, Lady Gwendolin Cecil is decidedly of opinion that his qualities were derived from his paternal grandmother, the daughter of Lord Downshire, whose cousin, the Duke of Wellington's mother, was also a woman of strong character. Their mutual ancestor, Sir John Trevor, was an able, though very unscrupulous, Speaker in the reign of William III, and cousin of the notorious Jeffreys. The later members of this connection were certainly morally far superior to the earlier !
In the case of Lord Randolph, his ability can almost certainly be traced, as in Chart 12, through the Stewarts to the Pratts, including among his direct ancestors a Chief Justice, a Lord Chancellor, and in the 3rd Lord Londonderry an eminent diplomatist and general, while the Hardinges, distinguished in many fields, are doubly related.
While the connections in these charts shew, however, the probable line of descent of ability, in the one case of Lord Salisbury and the Balfours, in the other case of Lord Randolph, the present Cecils and Mr. Winston Churchill owe perhaps as much to the lines of their mothers. There was much brilliance among Lady Salisbury's family, the Aldersons, while Lady Randolph's father was a very acute American business man. Here again we see the mixed aristocratic and commercial descent, of such undoubted eugenic value, and it may be remarked that in another line both Cecils and Balfours possess such a descent, the late Lord Salisbury's mother springing from a strictly commercial family, the Gascoignes, one member of whom was Lord Mayor of London.
It will be noted that these studies have been entirely confined to aristocratic families and connections, but it is in these alone that it is possible to trace many different lines of ascent and descent, or, at any rate, to discover anything of the characteristics of the individuals in these lines. The best descents are, however, never entirely aristocratic, the ' mixed ' marriages have in fact been of enormous eugenic value in this country.
A few very great names have been mentioned, but only a few, and the descent of actual genius, though not quite incalculable, is certainly very difficult to trace.
But in the case of great ability, as compared with genius, the effects of sound heredity are much more obvious, particularly perhaps in the power of leadership and in the power of charm.

through females. The first table includes maternal grandfathers and grandsons, the second maternal uncles and nephews. Where there is more than one grandson of note, or more than one uncle or nephew of note, the individual of the greater distinction is alone included.
