EUGENICS REVIEW
THE RELATION OF EUGENICS TO OTHER SCIENCES.
By HARRY H. LAUGHLIN, D. Sc., Eugenics Record Office, Cold S.pring Hwarbour, Long Island, New York..
EUGENICS is a newly-organised science made into an effective and harmonious unit for studying and directing race-fortunes, by co-ordinating and utilising the facts and forces of heredity, individual and social conduct, vocational and educational fitting, anthropology, law, psychology, psychiatry, institutional control, migration, mate-selection, differential fecundity and survival, biography, genealogy, and history. Within the last decade the work of this new science has so advanced that its futuTe is now secure.
Eugenics has two lines of endeavour; first, the negative-the cacogenic, the dysgenic, or the restrictive-which seeks to cut off the descent-lines of those individuals who are so meagrely or defectively endowed by nature that their offspring are bound to be anti-social, or at least unable to care for themselves, and who consequently entail a drag upon the more effective members of society. Darwin states that the greatest step in man's evolution came when he ceased to be guided by instinct and took to his intellect the task of determining his own conduct. The conscious striving for racebetterment on the part of the socially inadequate is impossible; eugenical appeal to them is fruitless. Therefore, society must control their reproduction. The building up of a great family-history archive for the whole body of the socially inadequate of a nation is the first great pressing duty of this aspect of eugenical work, for only by applying such knowledge can organised society, through its laws and institutions, act intelligently in exercising this much-needed control. Hence the necessity of close association between the investigators in eugenics and institutions-both public and private, custodial and field- for all classes of the socially inadequate, namely: (i) The
feeble-minded; (2) the insane; (3) the criminalistic (including the delinquent and wayward); (4) the epileptic; (5) the inebriate (including drug-
habitu6s); (6) the diseased (including the tuberculous, the syphilitic, the leprous, and others with chronic infectious and legally segregable diseases);
(7) the blind (including those with seriously impaired sight); (8) the deaf (including those with seriously impaired hearing); (9) the deformed (includ-
ing the crippled); and (io) the dependent (including orphans, ne'er-do-wells, homeless, tramps, and paupers), in so far as their inadequacies and handicaps have an heritable basis.. Charity and social service organisations of all types must be led to co-operate with the custodial institutions and eugenical research enterprises in the task of building and keeping up to date a national pedigree-archive of the socially unadapted strains within

our population. Finally, the law, by limiting marriage and by providing for the segregation or asexualisation of those individuals proven by sicientific study to be potential parents within the eugenical ban, must give practical effect to the nation's ideals of good human stock.
In America, one of the principal services of the Eugenics Record Office has been in training field-workers in the principles and practice of gathering at first hand the pedigrees of socially inadequate folk. These pedigrees, or family-history studies, as they are called, differ from the ordinary genealogy in that the latter is largely a record of names, dates, and connections, while the family-history study is a biological enterprise. The natural traits secured by first-hand measurement, and as reflected in the reaction of the individual to his environment, are analysed and recorded. The prime purpose of such studies from the eugenical point of view is to secure data which will enable the student of eugenics to evaluate the hereditary potentialities of the individual members of the family described. From the institutional point of view the histories are exceedingly valuable in that they throw light upon the diagnosis and prognosis of the individual custodial case. They also secure many data valuable for parole an,d aft-er-care officers to have in hand. In fact, the conpbining of eugenical field-study with after-care and parole work has worked out very successfully in many places. The Eugenics Record Office has encouraged practical field-studies by training a field-worker and lending such person to an institution desirous of making the experiment as to the value of eugenical field-studies. After a year of work on this joint basis, the field-workers of this office are withdrawn and sent as missionaries, as it were, to other institutions while the institutions which have had the introductory experience, as a rule, instal the business of gathering biological pedigree-material as a part of their regular institutional duties. This work bids fair to become universal in progressive institutions, and is very encouraging to the eugenicist.
The second phase of eugenics is the positive-the constructive, aristogenic, or eugenics-propeT phase-which has for its means the securing of
high fertility and fittest matings among the more talented families. It seeks thereby not only the breeding of leaders in specific lines of human endeavour, and the raising of the general level of intelligence, health, and
energy, but also the conservation and further specialisation of races and
family-strains. The working out of the positive aspect of eugenics, both in supplying data for pure scientific study, and in its application to life, is,
and will doubtless continue, largely a matter of eugenical education of the families concerned. The intelligent classes can and must take their own
evolution in hand.
Doubtless one reason why the prohibition movement has made such
rapid culminating progress in America in the last few years is because a generation ago laws were enacted requiring that the effect of alcohol
upon the human system be taught in the public schools. The children who had these lessons are now the men of affairs. If the eugenical ideal becomes established in the educational system of the country, we may expect that many thousands of our better families will, within two- decades, establish family-archives on a biological or true pedigree-basis. We may
expect, further, that the eugenical factor in the form of a knowledge of heredity will unconsciously, as well as consciously, guide mate-selection

THE RELATION OF EUGENICS TO OTHER SCIENCES. 5 5
to a very considerable degree. Furthermore, an enhanced sense of the responsibilities of parenthood will be one of the results of the knowledge of the manner of the transmission of human mental, physical, and moral qualities.
In eugenics the association between its purely scientific phase and its practical application is particularly close. For the investigator, eugenics presents in the field of pure science the usual beauty of mathematical form and theory, but apart from this its practical application as an agency for human betterment is the compelling thing. The breeding of the human animal is a slow and expensive process, but every marriage is an eugenical experiment, exactly as if made solely for the purpose of securing data. But in order to secure these data the closest co-operation must be had between the scientific investigator and the family whose welfare is so closely bound up in the facts desired by the student. Such co-operation betwveen the student and the social unit primarily concerned with, his studies is growing in a very satisfactory manner.
Eugenics, by a demonstration of the validity and usefulness of its newly-discovered principles and by its selection and organisation of existing knowledge, has become a branch of science which now functions as a unit, and has therefore its own principles, problems, character, and aspirations. Since every science has a definite set of articulations within the existing body of organised knowledge, it is fitting now for this new body of knowledge to take stock of its possibilities in serving and of being served by the various realms of human thought and action. The student of eugenics thus seeking finds the following elements in his science:

By no means an exhaustive treatment, but an examination of some of the salient features of each of these fields of eugenical activity follows:
i. Genetics.-Genetics plays such an important part in eugenics that the latter science is sometimes called the genetics of man. Eugenics is, of course, much broader than that, but the expression serves to emphasise the genetic factor. The determination of the facts of human heredity must be assiduously sought at all times. All of the secrets of this problem will, perhaps, never be known, but just now human genetics is a healthy infant, and therefore promising of great growth. Granted that the chromosome-theory of heredity holds good and that there are I2 (haploid number) chromosomes in man, there is one task in this potential field that deserves special attention, because its consummation is at present both needed and possible to achieve. Briefly, it is to map out roughly the human germplasm, that is, to chart the linear geography of the I2 chromosomes in much the same manner as the Morgan group of investigators have charted the four chromosomes of Drosophila. If the parallelism holds good, we should expect 12 linkage-groups of unit-traits in man. This particular

EUGENICS REVIEW.
problem might profitably be attacked in this manner: Prepare recordcards as follows: Prepare a tabulating-machine card for each individual, punched' accordiing to a code describing the family-connections and the physical, mental, and temperamental qualities of the individual, with perhaps 250 descriptive items for each individual. These cards should be made out especially for the F1 -generation, in pedigrees involving diverse
characters in the P -generation. A great many cards-say 5o,ooo-should
be prepared. Then they should be sorted for correlations. If it were found that there were 12 natural groups of traits, quite logically we could
conclude that each of these 12 trait-groups grew out of one of the
12 chromosomes, so far as the somatic aspects of the traits listed are determined by chromatin. But which specific trait-group and which specific chromosome we would not yet know. "Crossing-over" and the use of cards for individuals descended from two parents, both of whom are not heterozygous for the trait recorded, would complicate, but would not destroy the possibility of a solution. We could, however, speak of a given gene as lying in chromosome a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, or 1. The value of such knowledge in predicting genetic behaviour of a number of traits bound up in a given personality is obvious. The problem of just how a characteristic or trait described on the individual analysis-card would affect the correlation study, if such trait were a somatic complex of two
genes lying in separate chromosomes, must be clarified. Further analysis
of special cases would be expected to demonstrate the correlation between a given trait-group and a given chromosome, and to locate the gene in the chromosome.
But this is only a single problem. The collecting of pedigrees of specific qualities, covering the whole range of human structure, physiology and psychology must continue with a view to separating the factors of heredity and environment, to anailysing oomplex somatic aspects into unit traits, and thus to add definite facts to the body of known rules governing human heredity. In the race for knowledge, human genetics must run at least abreast with plant and animal heredity-studies. As the better human families establish their much-urged pedigree-archives, eugenics must, to do its share, be able to analyse them to a degree of refinement equal to the nicety of distinction made by the compilers in their studies. It must be able to say, "In reference to this specific trait, a child of this particular mating will, by a chance of a to b, possess this trait to such and such a degree, and as a parent his potentiality to pass it on will be thus and so."
Analysis and summary of facts concerning the biological forces at work for and against race betterment call for an increasing attention on the part of eugenics. Such studies supply the mass-data so useful in judging the tendencies, the rates of action, and the end-product of the forces which the eugenicist spends so much of his time in analysing.
2. Genealogy.-Genealogies and biographies have existed since civilisation began. At present the genealogist strives to work out the familynetwork, giving the names, dates, and connections. He is often content to stop there. The task of eugenics is to prevail upon all of these workers to strive to provide a description of the natural, physical, mental, and temperamental qualities of each member listed in the net-work. When

THE RELATION OF EUGENICS TO OTHER SCIENCES. 59
this is done, the genealogist supplies a record of practical pedigree-value, one which can be used in tracing the descent and re-combination of natural qualities within the family-tree.
3. Biography.-The history of mankind is equivalent to the biographies
of all of its human units. The different weights that different men have supplied in making history is so vast that we often shorten the statement by saying that "the history of the race is the biographies of its great men." The eugenicist has the task of convincing the writer of biographies that one of his principal duties in the description of the life of his subject is to Tesolve the factors of nature and nurture-to evaluate the effect of specific hereditary traits in making the human machine that turned out the specific product which he is describing as a life's contribution to history.
4. Anthropology and Ethnology.-To anthropology eugenics contributes a better instrument than the general science of man has heretofowe wmelded in analysing the manner of the segregation, transmission, and recombination of hereditary or racial traits, which traits comprise the materi-als with which the aanthropologist works, and the character of which traits constitutes the most fundamental basis of racial fortune. From the older science of man! eugenics draws records of gigantic eugenical experiments, involving new complexes, racial origins, developments, fusions,
selection, type-establishing, racial culmination, decay, and extinction,, in
each case guided by the environment, needs, and prowess of the peoples concerned. With the arrival of eugenics, the guidance. becomes self-controlled, and the far-sighted tribe or nation may now, if it will, control its own evolution and destiny much more surely than heretofore.
Deterining the forces governing the formation of races, tracing their vicissitudes and describing their bodies and conduct, constitute the tasks of the ethnologist and the anthropologist. More closely than any other field enumerated in this list, these sciences are allied to pure eugenical research. The ethnologist and the anthropologist study traits. They furnish materials for eugenical study. In this study of hybrid races eugenics, by its knowledge of heredity, aids ethnology in attacking many of its problems of racial origins. In turn, the eugenicist finds the study of anthropology and ethnology occupying a continuously greater proportion of his interests. Eugenics is cocerned with the improvement, diversifying and fixing of natural trait-complexes in families. It must in last analysis deal with (a) the social, economic, and biological forces that control mate-selection and fecundity, (b) the determination of the hereditary make-up of an individual, and (c) the rules which determine the nature of the offspring of given matings.
5. History and Archaology.-The; historian, whose business is to lump and synthesise and classify biographies to the extent that all names except
the most famous are lost sight of, must learn that the differences ing the human machlines he is dealing with have made the thing which he caJlls history read as it does. The student of history, reading his text-books, if he has a proper foundation in eugenical training, will learn to interpret the facts of his science in accordance with principles of truth more elementary than those he has currently used. Not only is the interpretation of written history subject to this treatment, but especially are the facts of prehistory, as the archaeologist brings them forth, capable of the clearest

60 EUGENICS REVIEW.
understanding only when we keep continually in mind What type of man did this or that ?-What were his hereditary qualities ?-What were his talents, his likes, his dislikes, and his weaknesses?
History finds in eugenics an improved scheme of interpretation. In short, the eugenical formula for this work is: A nation's conduct, and therefore its history, is the resultant of inborn traits of its own people, as they react to and are acted upon, from generation to generation, by the environment in which they live.
6. Law and Politics.-While the relation between law and politics, on the one hand, and eugenics on the other, is largely the service which
eugenics expects from legal procedure, still in turn a service will be rendered to the legal and political systems of the country by a eugenical ideal well established. In the field of criminal law, for instance, the analysis of personality which eugenical pedigree-studies present, will give the law a new viewpoint for governing its treatment of criminals, especially so far as placing blame and responsibility and in attempting social salvage are concerned. In the political field eugenics may be expected to develop a higher idea for the patriotic outlook of the nation. As a rule, a nation feels a general sentimental solicitude for the unborn generations, but when a people learn that they can so attack the problems of human reproduction that the future generations, so far as their innate traits aTe concerned, will be improvements over the present, a higher and finer sentiment will animate our political philosophy.
An ideal once established in a nation affects activities along many lines. The Eugenics Record Office often receives letters from persons who ask for the outline for a "model eugenic law." We must understand that the eugenical ideal cannot be wrought by a single so-called "eugenical statute," but that it will affect legislation in many fields. Indeed, it will be hard to conceive of any important national or state legislation as having been duly considered unless, no matter what the particular subject may be, its eugenical bearing be duly weighed. For instance, a law which relates to taxes and renders treatment differential between parenthood and sterility
has its eugenical bearing. By the birth- and death-registration laws data on differential fecundity and survival are provided. In laws governing marriage and divorce the eugenical principle is more directly concerned. In laws having for their purpose permanent commitment of the socially inadequate to custodial institutions, or their sexual sterilisation, if at large, are perhaps the most intimately eugenical subjects for legislation. It is thus probable that ultimately we may expect in all states, not a "eugenic law," whatever this may mean, but a eugenical code, comparable in its far-reaching activities, for example, to the body of sanitary laws.
7. Economics.-T-he extensi-on of commerce to the whole world makes world-wide eugenics necessary, and, fortunately, possible. The increase
of efficiency in the production of wealth enables the world to hold many more people. Modern medicine saves many more to maturity. Ultimately
the world will probably tend to become over-populated. Eugenical ideas will enter into our national habits, to the end that our laws and religions will demand and secure fit matings and more children from the most effective types, and will establish a differential against the right and
ability of the socially less valuable to bear children, until those strains

THE RELATION OF EUGENICS TO OTHER SCIENCES. 6I
most incompetent and suffering under the greatest natural handicap will be forbidden to breed at all. The restriction, of populwation on an economic basis, unguided by eugenics, spell,s racial decay., but if directed by biological prinIciples, even though the pressuxe to action be economic, restriction is a means of race-betterment.
For a country like America, which will doubtless again become attractive ito immigrants from all lands-alth-ough the prophets are at war, some predicting immigrants by millions and some picturing us
begging foT them after definitive peace-our immediate sanitary, political, and economic welfare must be guarded, but also the eugenical dictum, "Admit no immigrant who is a potential parent, whose kind we are unwilling to have grow into a large portion of our future population," should permeate every immigration statute and ruling. Practically, there is no bigger task for national eugenics than to educate the people up to demanding this. Present economic forces should be willing and anxious to co.operate with eugencs in determining a nation's immigration, policy.
In normal. times the production of wealth is proportional to the natural resources of the land and the available man-power. The unit of the latter is largely a matter of national traits with which eugenics is so largely concerned. Law, government, education, commerce, and ot;her forces interlock in, determining a niation's prosperity, but t¢he most fundamental factor is the quality -of the blood of the people.
In the matter of cost of social handicap, both directly to the state in charities and institutions, and indirectly in personal ineffectiveness among the people at large, the economist reckons jointly with the eugenicist.
8. Statistics.-Thus far the work of the United States Bure.au od the Census has been confined largely to the enumeration of individuals, and the tabulation of wealth and its distribution. However, some special studies have been made upon institutional population and upon the blind and the deaf, as well as upon the insane, but this analytical work has not gone far enough. One thing which is a pressing duty of eugenicists is to insist that future censuses, both national and state, make serious efforts to,evaluate the social adequacy of the individuals whom they count, and to make records of the family relationships. This involves social, and oftentimes medical and anthropological diagnosis and classifications, but the economic, social, and eugenical value of such work will many times repay the cost involved in training a body of expert diagnosticians and of maintaining them permanently on the staff of the Bureau of the Census.
Biometrical analyses of eugenical data are certain to yield more facts of both theoretical and practical value than the usual unanalytical tabulations and summaries which characterise so many of our demographic studies. As rapidly as they are developed, biometrical methods should be applied to studies in human heredity and human conditions.
9. Sociology.-There is a tendency on the part of sociologists to ascribe practically all of the factors of human destiny to matters of environment. On the other extreme we cannot, of course, ascribe everything to heredity. The great problem now, as always, is to make a true analysis of human reactions, ascribing to environment its true forces, and to hereditary qualities which react to environment their due weight. No headway can be made in claiming undue weight, either by biology or eugenics, for heredity, or by sociology or euthenics for environment.

62 EUGENICS REVIEW.
The whole group of our national mores must eventually take cognisance of the facts of heredity in determining human possibilities. People generally will demand that society be organised and managed so that the fullest opportunities for fit matings be realised, and that natural talent be given fuller play.
The organisation of eugenic associations and clubs is to be encouraged. The application to eugenical purposes of some of the efforts of existing general community-betterment organisations is a force which should be made use of by those concerned in the promotion of the general welfare. There are many clubs and organisations in all parts, of the country that are anxious to do something altruistic. Many of these are looking toward eugenics, indeed, some of them have become active collaborators with the Eugenics Record Office in prevailing upon their individual members to-direct their family-history studies along eugetnical lines; others are influencing the social activities of the community in the treatment of the socially inadequate. This is a fruitful field for further efforts on the part of eugenics. Especially promising appears to be co-operation with patriotic societies, such as the Daughters of the American Revolution, Daughters of the Confederacy, Colonial Dames, and Sons of Confederate Veterans. These organisations are interested in the blood of the nation.
Io. Medicine and Surgery.-The relationship between eugenics and the medical sciences has been so close that many persons are indiined to look upon eugenics as a branch of these sciences. Certainly, in so far as the cacogenic aspect of eugenics is concerned, its rrelationship to psychiatry is very intintate indeed. The early diagnosis of innate physical and physiological handicaps must be made by the medical sciences. In turn, the rules of the inheritance of these handicapping qualities which medical sciences may have diagnosed can, without doubt, be much 'beter formul,ated and specific predictions made in refeTrence to them by trained eugen,icists than by physicians. We have, therefore, -here a field for co-operation irather than for monpoly.
All of the work in the medical sciences has a eugenical bearing, in that medicine has for its end, health, sanitation, and hygiene, which in turn affect the differential survival of the race, which in turn determines who shall reach the reproductive period, and consequently the whole work of medicine must be rated as affecting very directly the eugenical status and the outlook of the people.
Practical surgeons must be called upon to perform eugenical sterilisation, when it is legally ordered. The matter of disseminating knowledge concer-ning 'birth-control is one in wich the physician is held responsible.
II. Psyckology.-Just as medi'cine is so, closely associated with eugenics in the field of health, sanitation, surgery, and physiological qualities, so from the mental and temperamental fields, psychology supplies the principles, data and practice used by eugenicists. Here again individual diagnosis is the woTk of the psychologist, but the analysis of pedigrees and the study of the descent and re-combination of specific mental, emotional, and volitional qualities is a task for the eugenicist. Not the entire, but perhaps the principal constructive work of the science of eugenics is found in the practical pedigree-application of qualities
studied by the psychologist.

THE RELATION OF EUGENICS TO OTHER SCIENCES. 63
12. Education.-If in the future eugenics is to play a prominent rale in improving and conserving our better American families, it will doubtless be found that ouT public school system will serve as the principal agent of consummation. The text-books on physiology, natural history, biography, history, and geography will be expected gradually to assume an eugenical attitude; they will set forth facts concerning the nature and control of the inborn potentialities of the individual, and will describe the forces that govern the fortunes of these possibilities, so that, as a matter of course, every educated youth will be taught the proper evaluation of natural heritable qualities in human affairs.
Just now there are many school courses and social-service institutions springing up, which have for their purpose the analysis of the individual, with a view to pointing out to him the most profitable line of endeavourvocational guidance, it is called. This is a common meeting-ground for eugenics, psychology, and the vocational school. The natural organisation of the individual that fits him for profitable training for the particular task is a matter of inheritance. The specific pedigree-facts and the known rules of inheritance serve as the basis of judgment in each particular case. When these facts and rules are considered, along with juvenile promise, the foundation for the science of educational selection and vocational guidance will have been well laid, and will be found to have drawn heavily upon eugenical materials. The recent work of Davenport1 on the
pedigree-analysis and juvenile promise of naval officers presents material
proof of this contention. With the socially valuable families, the task of eugenics is one of
education, self-study, and self-direction. These families are to be shown that, by establishing permanent family pedigree-archives, they can predict, within limits measured principally by the extent and refinement of their records, the natural endowments of the children of specific marriages, and that the personal capacities and limitations of its membeTs may more profitably be determined in early youth. Organised society assumes the whole task of correcting cacogenesis, but with aristogenesis eugennics acts in the role of instructor, archivist, advisor and r-esearch student.
I3. Religion.-What oould be more moral and consequently more
proper for moral instruction than the interpretation of human conduct as
modified by the two great factors of heredity and environment? With a practical working knowledge of these two elemental factors in human conduct such as modern field-studies supply, could not the moral leaders of a country lay plans for calling forth in a muich more effective manner a highly moral conduct on the part of the people? But there is another
very practical religious phase. While the basis of marriage standads,
so fax as the actual performing of the ceremony is concerned, must be legally determined, still, as soon as the church develops an eugenical creed, the legislatures of the more advanced states will not be long in following with laws requiring that before the paricular ceremony ibe performed the candidates for manriage present evidence of the eugenical, i.e., the biological, fitness of their particular mating. Until religion and eugenics unite their efforts, the latter will not make much headway in its practical application.

64 EUGENICS REVIEW.
To summarise, the eugenicist, finding that his science has secured for
itself a place in the field of thotght and action, seeks a closer association anid more united sexvice with each related irealm of human endeavour. Whenever -a branch of learaning is concerned with human Tepxoduction, social organisation, variation in individual structure or conduct, or racial fortune, the new facts that eugenics h-as organi,sed, and the new prnnciples that it has set forth may bye effectively drawn upon by the particular student of these distinct problems. Similarly, the eugenicist draws upon all of these other integrated departments of knowledge for many of his materials.
