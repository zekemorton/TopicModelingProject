This table has some interesting aspects. The heaviest fall has occurred in the births registered in the second quarter of the year and next in those registered during the third quarter. The rise in the ratio for the last quarter of I94I should be noted, as also should the regular course of the ratios up to
1939. Being composed of ratios and not of
absolute rates, the table does not bring out an apparent trend towards a levelling of the seasonal distribution of births. This however is shown below in a table giving the actual quarterly birth rates since I935.

increase in marriages during the first year of the war. Thus marriages were much heavier
than usual in the first and fourth quarters of I940 and f94I. These facts may wel supply the answer, but they still do not upset our point of less planning for births to occur
during particular months of the year. The Registrar-General tells us that *" The
intervals between marriage and the first
birth, in I938, show that about 40 per cent of women who married before 20 years of age must have been pregnant before marriage; the proportion was about 30 per cent for those who married at 20, about 20 per cent for those who married at 2I, and declined
with advancing age at marriage to 8 per cent
at 30-34 and 5 per cent at 35-39. . . . Twothirds of all irregular conceptions not terminated by abortion were regularized by
marriage."t

temporarily favourable factors (more mar-
riageable women, a higher number of married
couples, and probably a lower average age at
marriage), what is the effect ? The answer is
a birth rate as low as I3'2 per I,OOO popula-
tion or I3 per cent below that for I938 when the adjusted net reproduction rate was 684. So close are we to the turning point that, if the favourable elements had not been
present, or if the number of births in I94i had
been reduced by less than IO per cent, the total population of England and Wales would,
for the first time in our history, have declined.

In the absence of more detailed official statistics we canftot attempt more elaborate calculation§-but broadly speaking, we suggest that there are in the situation we have described no grounds for optimism. In a demographic position favourable to a higher birth rate we find, underneath the surface, a serious and continuous fall in reproduction. Moreover, the loss in unborn casualties to the end of I94I exceeds by IOO per cent the number of civilians killed by enemy action from the air.
