numbers is now failing by at least 25 per cent
to effect replacement. Another forty years of the same trend will mean that there will be only an elderly York to survey. But this task will have to be left to others. Seebohm Rowntree, by his social studies and by the

valuable material he has given us, deserves well of all reviewers, and in a book of over
500 pages it is perhaps a little unfair to grumble if everything has not been said that every reviewer could wish for.

RACIAL MIXTURE IN GREAT BRITAIN: SOME ANTHROPOLOGICAL CHARACTER-
ISTICS OF THE ANGLO-NEGROID CROSS

A Preliminary Report

W1TTITH the exception of a large
~ number of family studies secured
VYby Miss R. M. Fleming,* little anthropological attention has so far been given to the question of racial crossing in this country, although the presence of some fairly extensive hybrid communities in most of our sea-port cities affords an excellent opportunity for anthropometric investigation, particularly in respect to the AngloNegroid cross.t The present paper, comprising-a brief statistical analysis of the measurements of some ninety Anglo-Negroid or " Coloured " children, together with a smaller " White " sample of forty drawn from the same environment, represents what it is hoped may be merely a prelude to a wider and statistically more adequate survey of the
subject, especially as far as the adult element
is concerned. The present data, including those of a small number of adults Nith one Fi adult exception, were gained entirely from a community in Cardiff, where all the subjects were born. In the course of the

enquiry the opportunity was taken of examining a further sample of some eighty subjects mainly of Anglo-Arab and AngloMediterranean parentage. These, however, have been omitted from the present dis-
cussion for considerations of space. The Anglo-Negroid adult sample is as yet too small for statistical treatment, and has similarly been omitted, although a few
particulars as to its characters are given below.*
Briefly stated, the aspects of racial crossing it is intended to cover comprise such questions as the segregation of both quantitative and qualitative physical characters in the hybrid population, the comparative variability of the respective groups, and comparative differences in growth and sex differences. In the light of these considerations it was decided to. employ as wide an assortment of characters as was practicable, and having regard to the specific racial stocks involved, i.e. Negroid and Caucasoid

(White), to give special attention to those features which show clear differentiation between the parent stocks.. In terms of the present facilities these may be listed as skin, hair and eye colour, lip thickness, nasal width and height and the corresponding nasal index, and the ratio of nasal depth to width. In addition, a fairly large number of characters possessing genetical rather than racial significance were chosen, and these included such features as head length, head breadth, facial length, etc., etc., from which the relevant cephalic, facial, fronto-jugal and other indices were obtained. Finally, two modifiable characters in the shape of stature and sitting height were included.
For the sake of brevity, these characters are summarized below and listed under convenient symbols:
L-Maximum length of head (i). B-Maximum breadth of head (i). Bt--Minimum forehead width (i). Q-Transverse arc measured over the
head (3).
GH-Total facial height taken from nasion to gnathion (i).
G1H-Upper facial height taken from nasion to prosthion (2).
J-Maximum interzygomatic breadth
(I).
W-Gonial breadth. The diameter between the extreme outer points of the angles of the lower jaw (I).
NH-Nasal height. Nasion to. subnasale
(2).
NB-Nasal breadth. The greatest diameter taken between the wings of the nose (2).
Cr.-T. Taken from tip of nose (pronasale) to the crease (2).
ND-Depth of nose, taken from pronasale
to subnasale (2).
EO-Maximum diameter between the outer margins of the orbital openings
(I).
10-Maum diameter between the intemal corners of the eye (I).
LC-Thickness of lips (centre) i.e. labrale
superior to labrale inferior (2).
LL-Thickness of lips (left side) (2).

EL-Ear length or physiognomic height of ear (i).
EW-Ear width or physiognomic width of ear (i).
S-Total height standing (taken in stockings) (3).
SH-Height sitting (3).
Wt.-Weight (4). SE-Colour of exposed skin. SU-Colour of unexposed skin. HC-Colour of hair.
EC-Colour of iris of the eye.

measurements and observations will be found in

In the observation of skin colour the von Luschan

scale was used, the exposed skin being noted on the

It will be noted from the various Tables that the subjects have been divided into groups of " Coloured " and " White " males and females. The White are designated on the basis of both parents being of pure Caucasoid stock and natives of this country, and the Coloured on the basis of one or both parents carrying any amount of Negroid genes.* The Coloured have been further subdivided into the three broad categories of NNW, Fi, and NWW ?.t The NNW category is regarded as comprising subjects who on balance owe more to Negroid than White ancestry, and conversely, the NWW ? as subjects who owe more to White than Negroid parentage. For example, subjects were designated NNW with a West Indian
father and a Coloured mother, and NWW? with a West Indian father and a White
mother. These classifications are therefore

"In other words the individual was placed in a given genealogical class according to the information he was able or willing to give. It is -not claimed that the classes represent hard and fast lines; that, for example, the class 'about the same amount of Negro and White ancestry' is exactly one-half Negro and one-half White.

The former point is therefore dealt with in the attached Tables I and III, from which it may be noted that the average ages of the groups concerned work out as Coloured males 9 5S years, Coloured females 8 * 9 years, White males 9*9 years, and White females 9 * I years.

t As far as can be gathered, the proportion of female
parents originating in parts of the British Isles other than South Wales or Wales itself is far greater than the indigenous Welsh element. This finding is in accordance with the report of the Cardiff School Medical Officer after
an en'juiry on this subject made throughout the schools
of the town in 1925. In this case out of 705 instances, approximately only 22 per cent of the parents claimed to be of purely Welsh origin. Annual Report for I926 of the School Medical Officer, City of Cardiff Education Committee. .31927. Pp. 9-10.

the period between the lowest and the highest age-group is extensive in terms of growth there is a certain though not complete degree of uniformity in the respective agespreads. Nevertheless, these facts obviously mitigate against the possibilities of purely conventional treatment, and, as already suggested, demand that the present results must be regarded mainly as a basis for further material. In consequence, the statistical analysis which follows is not intended to provide more than an indication of a number of formulations or perhaps tendencies which may or may not be substantiated by further exploration. For example, although Means of direct measurements are provided for all the characters concerned, they offer for the most part a comparison of traits merely in
terms of the present samples. A slightly higher degree of validity may of course be accorded to the indices, more particularly the

cephalic index, since expressed in proportionate terms growth constitutes a less variable
factor. For comparative purposes therefore, constants have been limited to the various head, face, nasal, etc., ratios, and with the possible exception of the cephalic index it will be noted that they display a somewhat high degree of variability, which, as might be expected, is most pronounced where fleshy rather than bony parts of the skull are concerned. See Table II. On the actual
showing of standard deviations and standard
errors there is apparently little difference to be observed as far as the relevant indices are concerned between the respective samples of White and Coloured. The only character which shows any appreciable difference in
this respect is the cephalic index in the case of the male comparisons, where the White sigm.a is significantly smaller, and in'the case of the fronto-jugal index of the females,

Significant Traits
Means of direct measurements and observations selected for their significance on racial grounds are shown on Table III, and to amplify their implication further the various male sub-divisions are depicted graphically on the attached figures. Along with these are included the more modifiable, and hence less racially valid features of stature and weight, whose presence here may be justified on the grounds of the environmental identity of the background of both samples. Speaking generally, this closer analysis of nasal, lip, skin colour, etc., bears out what in terms of genetical theory might be expected. The only noteworthy exception to the rule of ascending nasal ratio with

bilities of error in the selection of the former may be invoked. On the other hand this same apparent discrepancy does not recur to any significant extent in the other traits to which the same type of comparison has been applied. [See Figs. I-4.]
The " Means " shown for Hair, Eye and Skin colour require comment in so far as any attempt to afford quantitativity to mainly qualitative characters obviously calls for caution.t In this case, both the initial estimation and the comparison have been

value with increased pigmentation. Some justification may, however, be claimed for
this procedure in as much as the variables of the Coloured sample show a continuous and
highly restricted distribution. On the other hand in the case of the White only the Skin

throughout both groups is shown on Table IIIA, the frequencies being expressed in percentage terms. From this it will be gathered that the respective modal shades of Hair are light brown for the Whites and dark brown for the Coloured, the White females showing a slightly wider range. In the case of eye pigmentation the modal shade in the case of the Coloured is very clearly full brown; the Whites on the other hand show a fairly even spread all the way from blue to full brown, the females being slightly darker-eyed than the males.
Both Stature/Age and Weight/Age ratios have similarly been computed on the basis of group Means, and here, discounting some potential inconsistencies owing to the respective age-distributions, the Coloured sample for either sex, as will be gathered from the relevant constants, shows signs of increased development over the White. Further interesting points, allowing for the possibilities of statistical inadequacy, is the indication of "hybrid vigour " displayed by the Fi sample, and the increased development of the females of both groups over the males.

See attached Figures 5 and 6. Finally, the cephalic index is remarkably consistent throughout, with a slight tendency towards decrease with the addition of Negroid
ancestry.*
The remaining Means are shown on Table IV, and their main interest is the general increase in size displayed by the Coloured over the White sample. Only in the cases of the sitting height, the ear, a variable trait, and the upper facial height of the males do the White Means equal or excel those of the Coloured.

In the course of the examination observa-
tions were made also on a number of other more general features, including the condition of the teeth. It was decided to grade this according to three categories: namely, I-excellent condition, i.e. no signs of disease
and absence of extractions; II-one or two teeth extracted or showing some signs of disease; III-a definitely larger number of
extractions or decayed and diseased teeth. The results of this inspection are shown on
Table V, both sexes taken together. Here, the point of interest is the high percentage of the NNW group graded in I. The Coloured sample as a whole shows up slightly better than the White. Dental anomalies were in-
frequent, and consisted of only three cases of marked over-crowding of the palate, the

As a final consideration the question of comparative growth is of importance, and, as quite numerous data on the subject of weight and stature in children in this country are available, is amenable to wide treatment. Having regard, however, to the difficulties of effecting reasonable comparison on racial lines outside the immediate environment, it was decided to restrict further consideration to as similar a milieu as possible. Accordingly a study made by G. P. Cathcart and A. M. T. Murray in I928 on 245 children drawn from a wide selection of Cardiff working-class families* was utilized, and in order to re-

children incorporated in the data of A. Greenwood, and with the more limited body of figures supplied by the Cardiff School Medical Officer." Ibid., pp. 23-28.

adjust differences in age-distribution, etc., as far as possible, the relevant ratios of the " Cardiff children " were worked out similarly
as group Means on the basis of the distribu-
tions of the Coloured and White samples of the present enquiry. The results are shown on Table VI, the " Cardiff " sample displaying its highest ratio on the basis of the White sample. Once again, it will be observed that the Coloured show up more strongly than
those of "indigenous " stock, particularly in the Height ratio, where apparently the difference is accounted for mainly by the increased size of the Coloured females.

As already suggested, having in mind the mitigating effect of the factors involved, our results must be regarded in the light of possible tendencies rather than as conclusions as far as the populations these samples represent, and the problem of racial mixture

itself is concerned. Perhaps the most significant feature is therefore the point just noted; namely, the signs. of increased
development shown by the Coloured section,
a point which receives further endorsement through the higher ratios of the CathcartMurray sample when based on the White figures. Similarly, if the Means of the direct measurements, length and breadth of head, facial height, etc., etc., are any indication it would appear as if the mixture of the two racial stocks and the addition of further Negroid genes has increased the size of most of the physical characters compared in the resultant population. In as much as racially speaking the Negroid Means for these characters are invariably smaller than the " British " or Caucasoid Means in general,* this point is of further interest, and here
again the possibilities of heterosist cannot be

ignored despite the varying extent of the genetic factors involved. As far as segregation is concerned, expressed of course in group terms, the influence of additional Negroid ancestry appears generally speaking to produce results well in accordance with orthodox genetical principles.
On the subject of the variability of the respective groups little can as yet be said, and this question along with our general suggestions may be left for the present to the test of more complete material, which, it is hoped, will presently be forthcoming.
In connection with the above I should like first of all to thank the Royal Society for their assistance towards this investigation in the shape of a Government Grant. My sincere thanks are due also to a number of people in Cardiff and elsewhere whom I may be excused from mentioning by name, but who have given me very material aid in arranging for this work. More particularly, I must thank Mr. W. J. Williams, Director of Education, and Dr. Phillips, Deputy Medical Superintendent in Cardiff, the Rev. Stanley Watson, Mr. B. H. Morgan, Headmaster of South Church Street School and his Staff, and also my wife for their assistance in this connection, and last but not least the subjects themselves, whose admirable patience throughout mad-e possible the taking of a large number of delicate measurements and observations.
