Introduction U NLIKE those of more advanced
countries, India's official vital statistics are not yet comnplete and reliable enough to allow of a comprehensive study of infant mortality in all its aspects during the
last half-century. Throughout this period, the
area of registration, in the sense of regular, albeit incomplete, returns, covers only twothirds of the geographical area and threefifths of the census population. The exigencies of public administration, the pattern of social progress, the working of provincial autonomy (in India public health is a
provincial subject) and the evolution of political freedom for the country as a whole have all conspired to make neither the area nor the population covered a constant factor
for the registration of vital statistics during the period under review.
From the turn of the present century, the rough area of registration begins with what has come to be known as British India (or rather the old provinces) excluding the Princely States. For some years, some incomplete vital statistics are available for a few of the larger and relatively progressive Native States such as Mysore, Travancore and Baroda, though such statistics are not always comparable with those of British India either in content or format. (The statistics of British India are relatively more reliable than those of Princely India.) The area covered by these statistics continued to be more or less the same until I947 with the exception of the creation in I936 of the two new provinces, Orissa and Sind, from the existing British area. Thus, there was
* A paper read at a Members' Meeting of the Eugenizics
Society on October 20th, I954. The paper is composed of excerpts from a forthcoming book. The author is indebted to the Nuffield Foundation for a Fellowship which has enabled him to work on the subject in the London School of Economics since December 1953.

some continuity for British India and the
total figures were not affected till August I947 when political power, accompanied by the partition of the country, was completely transferred to Indian hands. By
1948 the area of registration included all
the states of the Indian Union, excluding of course those provinces and states which
became Pakistan. The assumption that the area of registration from I948 embraces the complete residual Indian Union is only theoretical, for in practice, the returns from the old Native States (the modern B States) are still largely incomplete and irregular. With the gradual progress of the administrative integration of these States into the political structure of the country (by merger with an adjoining province, or a union of several small states as a new state, or continued independent existence as a reconstituted state of the Union) the statistical returns become a little more representative of the total area and population of present-
day India. But as this occurred towards the end of the period of the present inquiry, the benefit of this apparent improvement is not reflected in this essay.
For the fifty years under review there are
no returns for the present Indian Union as a whole, though adjustments can be made for the old provinces of British India (excluding the Native States) now in the Indian Union. It must be remembered therefore that in any discussion of Indian vital statistics there
are inevitable problems of under-registration, inaccurate returns and want of relevant details, so that no attempt is made here to correct or adjust the figures of infant mortality for the present Indian Union area
and population. This paper is therefore not
so much an essay on infant mortality in India as on -the problems confronted in
making such a survey.

must be based on unquestionable facts. But in the absence of factual data the public health policy of the Government is no better than'the proverbial blind man searching in a dark room for a black cat which was not there.
Sources
Two kinds of statistical data are available for surveying the trend of infant mortality in India during the last fifty years: official records and unofficial studies. Both, by virtue of their content, are of limited value.
The official sources are the series of Reports on Sanitation and Public Health issued by the authorities of the Government of India. The first series are the Annual
Reports of the Sanitary Measures Taken in India. These are principally concerned with the protection and promotion of the health of British and Indian troops, jails, ports and the civilian population. These reports simply mention total births, deaths and infant deaths for the area under registration. The only other detail that some of these Sanitary Reports give is the infant mortality rate by sex, i.e. the number of male and female infant
deaths per i,ooo male and I,000 female live births. The authors of these Reports (printed in England by the order of the House of Commons) express considerable diffidence as to the accuracy of the figures but a modern student of the subject is grateful for them, such as they are, for although defective, they cannot be too wide of the mark.
This series of Reports on $anitary
Measures in India begins for the year
i864-65, as the Annual Report of the Sanitary
Commissioner with the Government of India. As new concepts of the role of a government in promoting the public health of a country began to emerge, the Government of India appointed in I920 a Public Health Commissioner in the place of the Sanitary Commissioner and from that year the publication became the Annual Report of the Public Health Commissioner with the Government of India for the year concerned. With the

advent of freedom in I947 it was decided to integrate and centralize the medical and public health activities of the Government of India (a recommendation of the Bhore Commission on India's health problems in I943). The designation of the authority was changed to that of the Director-General of Health Services and the volume became
the Annual Report of the Director-General
of Health Services with an accompanying volume of statistical appendices.
There are also the comprehensive reports of India's decennial Censuses, the Census Reports of India which began in I872 and have been issued in a more or less uniform manner every ten years (except I94I) down
to I95I.
On the same lines, we have the Provincial Reports on Public Health and Population Census. These are the Annual Report of the
Director of Public Health and the decennial
Report of the Census for the various provinces and states. In addition, there are the
Annual Reports of the Executive Health
Officer for certain major cities such as Bombay, Calcutta, Madras etc. These are
the official and unverifiable sources of primary demographic data for India.
As distinct from these Government reports, a few studies by individual social scientists,
government experts and medical personnel are available. These are in the nature of
private ad hoc studies. With reference to
mortality in general and infant mortality in particular, their scope and objectives are
very limited as they deal with random samples of population such as a village, a famine-affected area, patients of a particular
hospital or selected villages and towns in a province. They refer to only limited periods of time within the five decades under review. Though these studies cover only select or random samples of population, they are of some value, for such facts as they do establish may prove to be either corrective or corrobo-
rative of official figures. A comparison between these two sets of official and unofficial figures, where possible, proves instructive, if the limitations of such a comparison are not overlooked.

2i6 THE EUGENICS REVIEW

Indian Vital Statistics
If the registration of vital occurrences is defective is it one of under-registration or the reverse ? What is the magnitude of error ? How far are these vital rates correct ?
These are difficult questions to answer. Every student of Indian vital statistics
knows that they are defective, scanty, scrappy and do not normally permit comparison. Evey Commission and Committee that has inquired into various aspects of Indian economy has emphasized this depressing lacuna and has pleaded for a reorganization of the system of vital registration.
Official reports are usually shelved as soon as they are published, for the publication of a report on any question in India is usually an excuse to postpone action indefinitely;
the authorities often seem to feel that the publication of a report itself is a solution to the question ! " Have we not published a governmental Report on this question ? What more do you want ? " seems to be the general attitude.
But the defect is usually taken to be one
of under-registration and it is further supposed that there is a greater under-registration of births than of deaths. (There is no registration of marriages at all save for a small number of civil marriages.) Though this assumption appears to be reasonable, it is Inot always the case. For instance, in his Annual Report for I924 the Public Health Commissioner with the Government of India observes, " The persistent high mortality of infants may be ascribed in part to defective registration, not only of births but of infant deaths, through the inclusion of stillbirths, since a distinction between the two is not always made by the illiterate chowkidar and police mahawar, and partly to the tendency of the more illiterate of the population to underestimate the age of the
deceased infants." If this were true, and
probably it is so in certain parts of the country, the defect becomes one of overregistration, instead of the generally supposed under-registration. This contention is supported by the observation of the Director of Public Health for Central Provinces in
his Annual Report for I934. He points out

that " A study of death registers maintained in urban areas leads one to conclude that more deaths are entered under one year of age than is actually the case. Infonnation given as to the age of the children, when reporting their deaths, is usually vague, with the result that many deaths over one year of age are returned as under one year. This is clearly shown by the discrepancy usually met with between the vaccination birth registers (which are reliable as the date of death of the child is entered against the birth entry) and the general death registers. The, former invariably show a much smaller number of deaths of infants under one than recorded in the general death registers."
Measurement of Infant Mortality The infant mortality rate is the number
of deaths of infants under the age of twelve months per i,ooo live births during the same year. It is assumed that all births and deaths are registered. Thus the infant mortality rate is an age specific rate inasmuch as it relates to deaths at o-i years of age. When it is thus expressed as a rate per i,ooo of the population at risk-namely of infants under the age of one year, this is assumed as approximately the same as the number of live births occuring during the year. This conventional way of expressing the infant mortality rate would, however, be correct if all the infants who died in a particular year were also born in the same year. In fact, however, infants who died before
completing their first year of age in I95I,
for instance, are the babies born in I950 who died in I95i before completing their first year, and those born in I95I who died before the end of that year. The conventional rate will be approximately correct if the number of births in the year before was more or less the same as that in the current year. But if births in the previous year are considerably higher or lower, the conventional infant mortality rate is apt to be misleading and will remain at best a crude one. Therefore, a more reliable rate is one which is calculated as the number of deaths under one year within a cohort of

uterine mortality (death of the infant during Infant Mortality Rates in Selected Countries, I951 labour). This not only gives an idea of the

amount of mortality after conception and before birth but also the extent of life that could have been saved if conception had taken place under ideal conditions. If these two are equated with abortion, there is the further component of stillbirths. Though these are not strictly a part of infant mortality, they are closely allied to it. Then there are perinatal mortality (infant mortality under one week), neo-natal mortality (death of the infant during the first four weeks), mortality after the fourth week and under one year, and the overall infant mortality as deaths of infants under one year. Here again, unless a country can accurately
r.ecord and carefully watch the progress of
every pregnancy, which India, like most other countries, certainly does not do, no serious analysis of this type can be undertaken.

This apparently arbitrary division proves
rather instructive when the infant mortality
rates for several countries belonging to these
four stages, between I90I-5 and' i947-52. are examined. Table i sets forth the available
data for selected countries. Fifty years ago, England and Wales, Holland and Switzerland, which were in the " very high" stage, have progressed to the " low " stage, involv-
ing a considerable reduction in the rate of
infant mortality in the last half-century. But countries such as Australia and New Zealand, Sweden and Norway, which began fifty years ago with relatively low rates, have not registered comparable rates of progress, for possibly the factors that contribute directly to a reduction of infant mortality were brought under control some decades ago. Scotland, Canada, France and Germany, which began this century with high rates

of infant mortality, have shown no spectacu-

It is also noteworthy that the countries with the lowest infant mortality rates are the advanced Western European ones and those
with European patterns and levels of living such as the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. These are the countries which have more or less low or stabilized
birth rates and where babies cannot be had at bargain prices. The practice of contraception has led to smaller families with the consequence that a greater premium is put on the life of a baby. It is true that when
more infants are born more infants will die (Holland with a high birth rate and a low infant mortality rate is a notable exception) though it is possible that more infants will survive.

(a) It is possible that comparability of these annual rates may be adversely affected by different degrees of reliability of the population figures used in the calculation of these mortality rates. Secondly, there is the question of the validity of comparing the three parts of the time series-the period before 192I relating to a scattered and growing area, the period 192I-46 relating to the former provinces of British India, and the period since I947 relating to the registration area of the Indian Republic, that is British provinces minus Pakistan and plus Native States.
(b) Until 1946 the registration area comprised the British provinces in undivided India excluding the Native States.
(c) Excluding East Bengal for which area figures are not available. (d) Partition of the country into India and Pakistan. (e) For I948 and subsequent years the figures are for the States
(provinces) of the Indian Union as reconstituted after partition. Registration throughout is officially stated to be incomplete. This is also true of the present States of the Indian Union.

Course of Infant Mortality
The above tables show India's unenviable
position among the Asian countries and in
the world. Tables 2, 3 and 4 give the course
of infant mortality from I9OI to the latest
available year and such details of the components of infant mortality as are available.
Table 2 deserves serious examination. It
gives the official infant mortality for the
provinces of British India, and in recent years for the area of the Republic of India, in annual rates and in quinquennial averages.
Two preliminary questions may be raised about these figures: One is about their reliability and correctness; the second is whether they reveal any trend.
How far are these figures correct? It is well known that the registration of both births and deaths is incomplete and defective, but it is believed that the registration of births is less reliable that that of deaths. As to the reliability of the recorded age, there are the following three possibilities: Some
births are not registered; some infant deaths are.not registered; wnen deaths are registered the recorded age of the deceased infant may be inaccurate.
This situation can be dealt with in many ways: The figures may be adjusted on the

basis of the various decennial Census figures, a procedure which presupposes their absolute
reliability, whereas it is known that they are not exact and there is always the problem of under-enumeration. Secondly, the magni-
tude of under-registration can be estimated, on the basis of a sample study and the
margin of error be taken as uniformly applicable to the entire area. Such simple
studies should have been made for every year and for every region to check the annual
vital statistics rates and every ten years
to check the decennial Census figures, but
such corrections as these are not available. According to the Population Data Enquiry
Committee Report, the magnitude of underregistration is estimated to be about 50 per
cent but this is nothing more than a reasoned conjecture when considering so long a period as half a century. In general, and theoretic-
ally, birth registration is less complete than death registration for obvious reasons. This is particularly true in countries where burial is the rule and a permit for burial is issued
only after registration of death, but not so in India, where the practice of quick cremation for an overwhelming majority of the population is widespread. When deaths are registered one is not sure of the exact age of the deceased. One might expect this error to be very minor in the case of infants for a lapse of memory on the part of parents or the recorders could not arise in such a short time, but in practice the error is significant. A study of urban mortality statistics reveals that the information which is given about the age of the child when reporting the death is usually vague, with the result that many deaths over one year of age are returned as under one year, thus swelling the infant mortality rate. In view of these considerations, the official figures
are examined here as such without any attempt at correction. If we do not set much store by the actual figures and are guided by only the trends revealed, we need not be misled by the obvious inaccuracies
referred to above. Both Table 2 and the graph show that:
a, the infant mortality rates throughout the period have been abnormally high in relation

I908-9 and I9I8) when the rates have been inordinately high and, c, a declining trend is noticeable since the I930s.
(a) During the last fifty years the Indian mortality rates range from ii6 per I,000 live births in I95I to 267 in I9I8; the fluctuations have thus an enormous range. A comparison of the Indian rates with those of Japan and Ceylon in Asia, England and Wales, Sweden and Holland in Europe, the U.S.A., Australia and New Zealand even during the earlier years of this century shows the difficult start India has had in the matter. She clearly began with a great handicap, for her public health and hygiene measures were (and are for that matter) in no way comparable to those existing in these countries with the possible exception of Japan. The causes for this excessive mortality must be sought in the social, economic, cultural, feligious and health background in India.

The diseases to which these infants apparently
succumb are discussed below in the light of
the available official information.
(b) Secondly, there are three-peak years,
I900, I908 and I9I8, when the infant
mortality rates (and mortality rates at all
ages) have been very high. Apart from what
may be termed " ordinary causes " from the Indian point of view, the high rate in I900
was due to famine in the country as a whole,
with defective nutrition leading to epidemics and heavy loss of life. The year I908 was
also a bad one, due to a severe malaria
epidemic over the whole of northern India.
While malaria is not always lethal in the
case of an otherwise " healthy " and normal
adult, it often proves fatal to an infant. The
highest peak in infant mortality, in I9I8,
was caused by the world-wide influenza
epidemic of that year which in India claimed
some I2 to I5 million people of all ages. (c) Despite these peaks and variations a
declining trend is noticeable since the I930S. The infant mortality rate has been on the decline since I935 except for a slight rise in I944 due to the severe famine in Bengal in I943-44 which took an estimated toll of
about 3 million people of all ages. The infant mortality rate has been exactly halved in the course of half a century, from 232 in I900 to ii6 in 195I. The rate in England and Wales was reduced from I54 in I900 to 30 in I95I. What took England and Wales twenty years to accomplish between I900 and I920, took India fifty years to achieve. In the United States of America, which is perhaps more comparable to India in area and a heterogenous population, the infant mortality rate was reduced by half in about thirty years from 99-9 in I9I5 to 39-4 in I944; and it was I22 in I900 compared to 29 in I950. While the rate of decline in India during the period in question has not been impressive in comparison with that in certain other countries, the decline has begun and if the present plans for health improvement, as a part of the First FiveYear Plan for raising the standard of living are carried out, further reductions are bound
to take place. Tables 3 and 4 reveal that in India neo-

natal mortality for the twenty years I920I939 ranges between 32 and 49 per cent of total infant mortality. In fact, except for one year, the mean ratio has been around 47 per cent. That is, nearly 50 per cent of infant mortality took place in the first month. In Western countries, the marked decline in mortality in recent decades has taken place in the post-neo-natal period covering the second to the twelfth month, while the first month has shown only slight improvement. This is also true of India except that we do not have figures for the last ten years to demonstrate clearly at what age the real decline in infant mortality set in.
On the other hand, the declining trend in infant mortality evidenced in the official figures'may not be real. Since I942 there has been a national quasi-chronic food shortage, acute regional shortages of food which though not always as intense as the Bengal Famine of 1943, are often near the famine level, a lack of housing made worse by the influx of refugees as a result of partition, and a considerable rise in the cost of living. As a result of these conditions, morbidity and mortality in the vulnerable groups of the country's population must if anything be on the increase. Here again
there is no indisputable evidence. Is then the
decline in infant mortality rates noted in
Table 2 real -or imaginary? An answer to
this question is important, for if the decline is real, then the implications of such a decline, as already pointed out, need to be explored. If, however, the decline is illusory, the inferential attitude of complacency on the part of the authorities should be given up and
vigorous efforts made to effect such a decline. Furthermore the fact that the recorded
rate of infant mortality has not risen in
spite of improved registration should not be lost sight of. The decline is marked in
some provinces and it is striking in the
composite state of Madras where the Director of Public Health, in his Annual Report for
1948, points out that the decline is real: " The steady decline in infantile mortality in
recent years in spite of the difficult food

situation is due to improvement in environmental hygiene, expansion of maternal and child welfare services, health education and raising the age of marriage."
In the face of the only available evidence, it must be assumed that some decline in infant mortality as revealed in the official figures, must be taken to be nearer the truth. Three recent inquiries have yielded figures which though high when compared with those of Western countries, are low in comparison to earlier Indian figures.
Some Recent Surveys There have been a few general socio-
economic or health surveys of select samples of Indian population in recent years but none are really ad hoc surveys dealing specifically with infant health, morbidity and mortality. The one ad hoc survey devoted to this subject in Madras in the Poonamalle area under the direction of Dr. H. M. Rajamanickam, Deputy Directress of Public Health, has just been completed but the report of the results of the infant mortality survey has not yet reached the present writer. However, three
recent surveys which have yielded infant
mortality rates are summarized below to give an idea of the wide range of the rates in different areas of India.
Singhur The All-India Institute of Public Health
and Hygiene in Calcutta conducted in I943 a general health survey of Singhur-a nearby rural area involving some 300 families and 307 live births. The Survey yielded an infant mortality rate of about I37. The Report points out, " The sex specific infant mortality being I96 and 85 for males and females respectively, the former are again at a considerable disadvantage. The special reasons for higher rates amongst the former may also help to indicate lines along which endeavours could be made to reduce waste in early life. From the analysis of the causes of death so far carried out, it would appear that a multiplicity of causes are in operation but there are some indications of difficult labour as being one of the possible causes of infant mortality amongst the males."

low mortality record, given relative high levels of income and education and better housing.
The Causes of Infant Mortality What are the causes of such infant mor-
tality as India has experienced during this period ? If Indian vital statistics in the sense of mere registration of births and deaths are inadequate and inaccurate, the registered causes of mortality are even more so. A majority of deaths, including those of infants, occur outside hospitals and clinics and by and large unattended by doctors. While 70 per cent of the total population live in villages which have no hospitals, about 8o per cent of the qualified medical personnel live in urban India. As death certificates, showing cause of death, are not issued by medical authorities for the area of registration as a whole, it is difficult to establish precisely the medical causes for the high infant mortality in India.
Though exact figures are not available it is known that a great majority of deliveries take place outside hospitals and maternity homes; births taking place in the home are not necessarily attended even by trained midwives. While actual figures are not available to establish percentages an informed guess would put the number of home deliveries unattended by medical personnel at about 70 per cent of total births. Even small sample inquiries into the causes of infant deaths have been impossible on account of difficulties in performing postmortem examinations.
The Public Health Commissioner with the Government of India in his Annual Report for I93I points out: " In India, statistics of causes of infantile mortality are not recorded but it is generally known that premature births, convulsions, fevers,, malnutrition, respiratory diseases and bowel complaints are main causative factors in the death rate under one year." In his Annual Report for I934 he states: " The poor nutrition of the mother, over-crowding, a high birth rate and a high maternal mortality rate, frequent prematurity and the prevalence of respiratory diseases, convulsions, malaria and syphilis,

combined with widespread ignorance of infant management-all contribute to the
great loss of infant life in India. The birth
rate, as also the infantile death rate, is high among the poorer classes, owing to the
inaccessibility to them of efficient medical
service." Thus, for the former provinces which constituted the general registration
area till I947 we have no statistics beyond
intelligent guesses based on general practitioners' knowledge of the people and their health problems in and outside their homes.
However, it has been established that causes of infant deaths can be grouped roughly into two main classes, namely those
responsible for death within one month of
birth (neo-natal mortality) and those responsible for mortality between the second and the twelfth months. Deaths in the first
group are primarily due to prenatal and
natal influences. The second group covers
those who have succumbed in the main to
causes arising from postnatal influences such as the various epidemic diseases, diseases of the respiratory system, faulty feeding and other environmental factors.-
In view of the difficulties of the Indian situation, the causes for the first group are probably more easily ascertained than for the second group. For the first group they are: ill-advised pregnancies in the sense that they are not advised at all in view of the health of the potential mother; frequent and ill-spaced pregnancies; absence of antenatal care; malnutrition and low vitality of the expectant mother to begin with, and malnutrition during her pregnancy; insanitary surroundings; absence of trained midwives and health visitors; the damaging and meddlesome midwifery of the Dai, the ignorant, indigenous midwife; and last, maternal mortality itself as a cause of infant mortality. This last factor is often ignored but in an underdeveloped country like India where the incidence of maternal
mortality itself is abnormal, its Velation to
infant survival must not be lost sight of. Perhaps the dominating factor affecting the health and welfare of the baby, in fact, in most cases, the very survival of the baby, is the mother. Her health, attitude, ability

SOME OBSERVATIONS ON INFANT MORTALITY IN INDIA

225

and understanding are directly concerned with the welfare of the baby. It is obvious
that the death of the mother during labour or before the baby reaches its first birthday has a profound effect on its survival and
welfare even in advanced societies, but in
India, the chances of adequate care for an orphaned baby are remote. Foster mother-
hood, even when it exists in the family home,
can seldom take the place of the dead mother with all her care, attention and
instinctive affection. The causes of mortality in the second
group are more difficult to establish in the absence of statistics. However, statistics of a
limited nature are available for some major
cities where infant death returns by causes have been more or less obligatory. About nine cities have statistics for some of the
years within the half-century under discussion and there are some random sample
studies of infant mortality. Of the former, the statistics of causes of
death provided by the Bombay City Executive Health Officer for a number of years
appear to be reliable in that they represent continuity of observation. A composite list from such statistics for a period of twentyfive years, I925-50, is given below in the order of their importance. The order is based on the percentage of deaths of infants due to these various causes, which are rather vague and would not satisfy the needs of modem social medicine, but it must be remembered that even in a city like Bombay infant deaths are not necessarily certified by a qualified pediatrician; the list, how-

ever, does give an indication of the infantile ailments that prove fatal in India. They are: infantile debility, malformation and
premature birth; respiratory diseases; convulsions; diarrhcea and enteritis; small-pox; dysentery; measles; fevers, particularly malaria.
To these must be added poor mothercraft
and the woeful lack of a general education
of the expectant mother. Reproduction and motherhood are held to be natural processes
but when they are beset by so much morbidity and mortality there appears to be something almost unnatural about them.
If infant mortality is conceded to be the most sensitive index of a nation's social welfare, public sanitation and hygiene, India's claim to any real development of these services is small indeed. What has been achieved elsewhere in controlling and conquering these fatal ailments must be possible in India. " Health " as Rene Sand pointed out long ago, " is purchasable. Each country, within certain limits, decides its own death rates." A community can achieve conspicuous success in infant welfare primarily through the education of its mothers; educated and enlightened mothers may be expected to educate the rulers who appear to be so impervious to the needs of the most helpless section of the community, as well as to the recognition of the potential value of our infants as future citizens of the country. Such an education presupposes an awareness, but such an awareness is only beginning to dawn in the minds of the people and the Government of India.
