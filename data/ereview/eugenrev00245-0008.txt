STAGES IN POPULATION GROWTH*
By C. P. BLACKER

T HE science of demography has been
described as the statistical study of
populations in terms of births, deaths, marriages and migration. Demography is a mainly quantitative study: considerations of quality which call for value-judgments belong rather to the province of eugenics. But demography genetics and eugenics are linked, and some writers think that demography should comprise qualitative as well as quantitative studies.
In a broad view of the world, a view extending beyond Western Europe and the " advanced" countries which now have low fertilities, q(ualitative or eugenic considerations yield precedence to quantitative. Indeed, preoccupations about quality do not naturally arise until the purely numerical question takes on a certain aspect.

though imperfectly known to-day and still less known in the past, has, in the last five generations, enormously increased. Indeed, it has almost certainly doubled in I50 years. Table I shows the population by continents between i8oo and I939*:

A Demographic Cycle: Five Phases
A demographic cycle has been described through which passes a country which is being industrialized and urbanized. An attempt will be made to describe this cycle and to sketch the differential growth of the peoples of the world. We are here confronted with a menacing long-term threat to future peace. Indeed, the world can scarcely be safeguarded from war until a solution is reached of the demographic dilemma which chiefly confronts the continent of Asia.
The problem which now preoccupies Bnrtish demographers, the problem which a Royal Commission has been appointed to consider, is one of diminishing fertility. We are apt to lose sight of the fact that the predicament which confronts the world as a whole is not one of falling, but of rising numbers. The population of the world,
* From a forthcoming book, A Survey of Eugenics. It is contended elsewhere in the book that eugenic or qualitative problems do not commonly arise until a certain stage (the late expanding stage) of population growth is reached. The quantitative question therefore forms the background of the qualitative. The latter arises naturally in its own time.

To the best of our knowledge, the popula-
tion of the world grew from some 9I9
millions in i8oo to some 2,o8o millions in
I939, a percentage increase of I27. Throughi-
out this period the continent of Asia coiitained more people than the whole of the
rest of the world put together. The peoples of North and Central America grew faster
than those of any other major region: they
show an eleven-fold growth-largely the result of what Woodrow Wilson called " The
Swarming of the English." This prodigious increase in the number of
human beings is the direct result of influencis
which have emanated from the " Western;" hemisphere. Let us consider more closely what has happened. Five stages, or phases, are discernible in the demographic cycle which may be denoted by the following terms: high stationary, early expanding, late expanding, low stationary, and diminishing.

resulted in a significant growth of population. The age-old Malthusian dilemma still
confronts China. Other countries perhaps to be counted in the high stationary phase (accurate figures are not available) are Afghanistan, Persia, Arabia and Ethiopia. So also are many of the native peoples of Africa, Indonesia and South America.

* Period covered is I922-5. The figures, taken from the Statistical Year Book of the League of Nations, Geneva, I945, are provisional or approximate for all the countries except Palestine. Registration of births and deaths presents difficulties, different for each category. The deaths of children are especially liable to escape notice, and the rates probably underestimate the realities, especially in the earlier periods shown in the table. Noteworthy are the consistently high birth-rates and the much lower death-rates which may show a decline over the period covered, as in the Arab population of Palestine and in Formosa and Mexico.

dependencies in Asia and Africa. They can be counted on the credit side of the balance
in the " account " of the Colonial powers.
Thus have increased the populations, for
example, of India, Burma and Malaya under
British rule, of Indonesia under Dutch rule, of the Philippines under American rule, of Indo-China under French rule, of Formosa, Korea and Manchukuo under Japanese rule.
All these countries are now rapidly increasing
in numbers, some very rapidly. The island of Formosa, so named by early Spanish navigators because of the magnificence of its scenery, passed into the hands of the Japanese after the Sino-Japanese War of I895: about 94 per cent of its population is Chinese, and it provides a striking example of how a population can grow in the early expanding phase. Numbers have increased from just over three million in I905 (this number is an estimate) to 5,872,ooo in I940.
Thus the population has nearly doubled in thirty-five years; and about two-thirds of the increase has occurred in the last fifteen years since the data became fairly reliable.

A very high birth-rate for the native Chinese
of about 45 per I,000 can be compared with
a death-rate of about 2I. The enormous rate
of natural increase thus resulting would produce a doubling of the population ini
about twenty-nine years. The example is
interesting because it relates, in Warren
Thompson's words, to " the only Chinese
population of more than a few thousand for
which even moderately reliable data are,
available." A country from every standpoint more
important than Formosa is India, about
whose population our knowledge, compared to that of China, is abundant and detailed. The first census of India was taken in I872, when an enumeration was made of some 203 million persons. The conduct of a census, even in a developed and urbanized country like Great Britain, presents formidable difficulties. The first four censuses taken in this country-in i8oi, i8ii, I82I and I83Iwere admitted to be defective by JohnRickman, who was made responsible for their analysis. The conditions of a vast, densely

STAGES IN POPULATION GROWTH

- 91

populated, politically heterogeneous country like India in I872, with a mainly agricultural and illiterate population, with poor means of communication throughout areas of wide geographical diversity, were illsuited to accurate enumeration. Allowance for unavoidable defects in the census of I892 raise the figure of 203 to 256 millions. The census population in 194I numbered just under 389 millions. The seven intervening decades have produced remarkable variations in decennial increase, ranging from under three millions in three decades
(I872-8I; I89I-I9oI; I9II-2I) to over 50 millions in the most recent decade (I93I4I). Such fluctuations, caused mainly by famines and epidemics, mark India's transition from the high stationary phase to the early expanding phase of the demographic cycle.
An authoritative Health Survey and Development Committee, under the chairmanship of Sir Joseph Bhore and consisting of nineteen Indian and seven British persons, all equipped with high medical, scientific or administrative qualifications, produced, early in I946, the four volumes of their report.* The views of this committee can be taken as the most recent and the most authoritatite statement of the present condition of India's health and of that country's future needs. I will quote three paragraphs which could scarcely be more succinct:
Mortality
304. During the last two decades there has been a steady fall in the mortality rate of the country. A further fall is bound to occur if the large-scale programmes for improving the health of the community advocated by the different post-war planning committees are effectively put into operation. There is every reason to believe that there will be a saving of at least three million lives every year in British India, which will bring its rate of mortality down to the level of what has already been accomplished in a number of other countries. In the decennium between 193I and I94I, the average yearly addition to the population of India as a whole was five millions. An annual saving of three millions in British India as the result of improved health conditions will raise India's rate of growth to 8 millions a year, without taking

into consideration any fall in mortality that may be brought about in the Indian States through similar health measures. Under such conditions, the very large tncrease of 83 millions, which took place in the twenty-year period between 1921 and I94I, is likely to be reached within half that time. (My italics.) A purposeful control of mortality, without a corresponding fall in the fertility rate of the community; can thus have far-reaching consequences.
Fertility
305. All available information seems to suggest that the fall in the fertility rate in India during the past sixty years has been negligible compared with the fall in mortality. In this connection certain estimates of the rate of fertility and mortality for the country are quoted from an interesting study of India's population problem by Kingsley Davis, under the title of " Demographic Fact and Policy in India," published in the Milbank Memorial Quartrly
(July I944).

306. It seems fairly clear that, at least in the

immediate future, there is little reason to believe

that there would be a marked fall in the fer-

tility rate of the country.

According to the above table, India's

efforts to emerge between the years i88i and

I92I from the high stationary to the early

expanding phase of the demographic cycle

were spasmodic and uncertain. In the decade

I9II-2i, birth and death rates, both very

high, were closely similar. But in the decade

I92I-3I the death-rates plunged sharply

down, thus unmistakeably signalizing India's

entry into the early expanding phase of the

cycle. The committee say that they think

that India's population may grow by over

8o millions in every ten years. Her position

is thus conspicuously different from that of

China where, as previously remarked, the

high stationary phase of the cycle still seems

to prevail.

Something has been said about the diffi-

culties of conducting a census in India.

Similar difficulties attend vital registration,

tion is that, over large areas of the country, registration of births and deaths is not compulsory. Further, as has been pointed out in the Memorandum on Indian vital statistics, " even
in those limited areas where vital registration is compulsory, the provisions of the Acts are rarely enforced so that, generally speaking, vital statistics are deplorably defective." Another cause is that the village chowkidar, who is responsible for reporting these events in respect of the rural population, and the police, who are responsible for registration, are so overburdened with other work that their tendency is to regard their duties
in connection with vital statistics as of relatively smaller importance.

Responsibility, writes Lorimer, for the registration of vital statistics had been transferred at the time of the revolution from ecclesiastical to
civil authorities. This transfer encountered some
resistance among conservative groups. More-
over the organization of a new registration system within the framework of a revolutionary society, in a nation recovering from war, civil disturb-
ance and famine, and with half of the population illiterate, was a stupendous undertaking. However, great energy was devoted to this task, which was recognised as an essential requirement of the planned organization of Soviet society. The new registration system was
operating over a wide area by 1924.

94 THE EUGENICS REVIEW

Japan broke decisively with the traditional economy of the past and began to adopt the industrial economy of the West. Prior to that time, Japanese industry was almost entirely a simple hand industry concerned with the needs of a local population. . . . Their needs were largely determined by custom and were stabilised at a level just sufficient to maintain life in the mass of the population. The Japanese were then living much as the mass of the Chinese do to-day, with an extremely narrow margin between production and starvation-a margin which was not always maintained.
The leaders of the country then embarked
on the programme of industrialization which culminated in the attack on Pearl Harbour. The steps in this change are very clearly described by Thompson, who stresses the accompanying development of town life:
Whereas I9 9 per cent of the Japanese people lived in communities of 30,000 or more in 1920, 28 * 5 per cent lived in such communities in I930, and 38 -4 per cent in 1940. The same trend is shown by the declining proportion of the occupied population engaged in agriculture. This group declined from 52-4 per cent in I920 to 43 * 7 per cent in 1936.... Probably not over 40 per cent of the occupied population of Japan is now engaged in agriculture.
This movement from the countryside
towards the towns has an important effect on the birth-rate. It was remarked above
that abortion and infanticide were prevalent in Japan in the century before i868. Abor-
tions do not count as births; but infants killed after birth should so count, though
there are obvious reasons why their births
should escape registration. Though the practice of infanticide may well have masked the realities, birth-rates in Japan before that country's industrialization were probably as high as those of other countries in the high stationary or early expanding phase. Thus in the rural areas, Thompson points out, birth-rates are still high. " In I933 the five northern prefectures on the main island had
an average birth-rate of 39 7 per I,ooo and an average death-rate of ig * 6, leaving a natural increase of 2o i, which is far above that for Japan as a whole." Indeed, it is part of Thompson's thesis that declines of death and birth rates which characterize the whole demographic cycle are almost automatic accompaniments of the processes of industrialization and urbanization.

Table IV, showing birth and death rates for Japan, can be compared with Table III which gives similar rates for the U.S.S.R.

The above figures, taken in conjunction
with the fact above-mentioned that in I933 the birth-rates in a rural part of Japan were
as high as 39 7, suggest that by I9iI Japan
was already far advanced in the late expand-
ing phase of the demographic cycle. She had
left well behind her the high birth-rates of
40 and over per I,OOO which typify the
" earlier" phase. The nine countries shown in Table V
exemplify movements occurring in the late expanding phase (see p. 95).
The first four countries are from Eastern or South-Eastern Europe; Italy and Spain are South European countries; the Argentine and Chile are South American countries and
it will be seen that the Argentine has, in the last decade, reduced her death-rate to a low
level. All these countries show the following
features: In every year, birth-rates are higher,
sometimes much higher, than death-rates;
birth-rates, which rarely exceed 40 per I,OOO (though allowance for under-registration should be made in the countries asterisked), show a sometimes irregular decline throughout the period. Death-rates show a steadier decline with fewer and less striking intermissions.
The Jewish population of Palestine shows a trend worth comparing with that shown in Table II for the Arabs in that country. The birth-rate of the Arab element is very high, exceeding 50 per i,ooo in I943; the deathrate of the Jewish elements was, in the same

year, very low (under 8 per I,ooo), partly because of the large number of young immigrants. The two elements are in different phases of the demographic cycle. The present and future implications of this difference are obvious.
Low Stationary Phase 4. The fourth or low stationary phase of
the demographic cycle is marked by low birth and death rates. But there arises here a difficulty which can be overlooked if birth and death rates alone are considered. The difficulty relates to what is likely to happen in the future. When birth-rates are consistently and conspicuously higher than death-rates, we can assert not only that the population is increasing but that it will probably go on increasing. But towards the

end of the late expanding period, a moment arrives when what is at the time happening is an unsafe guide to what is likely to go on happening. An excess of births over deaths in a given year implies that in that year (emigration excluded) the population has increased; but such an excess does not necessarily imply that the increase is likely to continue in the future. The crude birth and death rates give, like a snapshot, a momentary picture of events in a given year.; but they have little predictive value.
The most useful index is here the net reproduction rate: this has been so well and so often explained that it need not be described here beyond saying that it epitomises and condenses in a simple figure the reproductive activities of all childbearing women in a

96 THE EUGENICS REVIEW

country. When the index stands at unity the reproductive element in the female population will be exactly replaced (if current trends continue and we ignore migration) in the next generation. When the index falls below unity, the same element is failing to repro-
duce itself. It can happen, indeed it nearly always happens when a country is passing
from the late expanding into the low stationary phase of the cycle, that when low birth-rates exceed still lower death-rates, the net reproduction rate is standing at or below unity. When, therefore, we consider which countries are to be placed in the low stationary category, we dowell tobe guided by the net reproduction rate and to ignore small disparities between low birth and death rates.
Here a parenthetic question arises. Why
not, then, the reader may ask, use the net
reproduction rate in describing the three preceding phases? There are two answers: In the first place, the net rate does not enable
us at a glance to assign a country to its appropriate place in the cycle. A country in
the high stationary phase would have a net reproduction rate of about unity; but its gross reproduction rate, which does not take
account of mortality, would be much higher. Indeed, the disparity between the gross and net reproduction rates is a measure of the mortality by which the female moiety of the
population is reduced throughout its repro-
ductive life. In the second place, the gross and net reproduction rates call for more detailed information about a population than do crude birth and death rates. The latter require a knowledge of the country's total population in a given year (for the rates are calculated per th6usand of the total population) and of the numbers of births and deaths occurring in that year. But the gross reproduction rate requires further a classification of the female population by age-groups, and a record of the age of the mother at each birth; the net reproduction rate, which takes into account the deaths likely to occur between one generation and the next, still further requires a knowledge of deaths by sex and year of age at death. This information is not available of all countries; indeed, the less advanced a country in the demog-

raphic cycle, the fewer and the less rehable its essential records. But if as much progress is made in demographic methods in the next hundred years as was made in the last hundred, it will shortly be possible to assess the vital trends of the countries of the world far more precisely than is possible to-day.
Fertility has fluctuated throughout the world in surprising ways in the last ten years.. Rises have occurred in many countries during the second world war which have not borne
out expectations based on events during the first. The rates of several countries stood below unity before the war but have risen above unity since its outbreak. It is too soon to say how permanent are these reversals of past trends. Included among the following seventeen countries are some whose net rates
have sunk below and risen above unity in the last ten years. These rates (some not strictly
accurate) are fluctuating about unity and justify us in placing the countries concerned in the low stationary group:

Czechoslovakia), the U.S.A., Australia and New Zealand. None is in Asia, Africa or South America. France is the only country whose net reproduction rate has,
since the turn of the century, consistently fluctuated below unity (Table IX).

Declining Phase 5. The fifth or declining phase of the
demographic cycle is one which it is the object of all the countries mentioned in the preceding paragraph to avoid. The phase is easy to recognise and define, for it is marked by an actual excess of deaths over births and, unless compensated by immigration, by a fall
in numbers. The depopulation of certain islands, such
as Tasmania, where none of the original
native inhabitants survive, or of Tropical Oceania where they have been much reduced; or the disappearance of native races from areas of a continent, as the North American
Indians have disappeared from many of their original hunting grounds, are to be counted rather as a reaction to the spread over the globe of the white man than as an autonomous phase in a demographic cycle. In recent times, France is the only country which has experienced an actual excess of deaths over births for more than a momentary period; and there are signs that, perhaps as a result of very energetic measures taken since the end of the second world war, this trend is now being reversed.

It will be seen from Table VIII that during the decade I9II-20 deaths exceeded births by
wide margins; yet in the following fifteen years (I921-35, Table VII) births again pre-
dominated. But from I936 onwards, unfavourable trends reasserted themselves.
Since the end of the second world war,
however, the new French Government has pursued a very vigorous population policy
with what are claimed as satisfactory results.
Since the turn of the century, the effects of low birth-rates were heavily offset by the encouragement of immigration. Precise figures cannot be given because of France's long land-frontiers; but there was on
balance an inward movement from I872, which reached its maximum in the decade
I92I-3I when no less than I,953,000 immigrants were computed to have entered the

and that of this last t.otal I,092 millions (the

continent's population minus that of Japan

and the U.S.S.R. and almost exactly half the

population of the world) are in Asia.

We may now glance at the past and the

probable future contribution of Asia to

world population. Figure I, based upon

Table I, shows graphically how, from i8oo

to I939, Asia's contribution to the total of

world population steadily diminished. The

rest of the world was steadily catching up

on Asia during the period that the white

peoples were " swarming." Throughout these

I39 years, the population of North and

Central America increased from an estimated

figure of I5 millions to one of I84 millions-

demographic disequilibrium of the to-day is surely its biggest long-term

problem. For the standards of living pre-

vailing among ,the high stationary and the

early expanding peoples of Asia are far below

those of the remaining peoples. Yet we are

to-day assuming a collective responsibility to

raise these standards. The days have, we

hope, gone for ever when glutted food-pro-
ducing countries destroyed their redundant surpluses while hundreds of millions of the
peoples of Asia were living at subsistence level, too poor to buy. But what of the
future? The World Food and Agriculture
Organisation (F.A.O.) has been formed and a new morality is being preached. Sir John Boyd Orr has said that " any Government
which will not accept in principle the policy of aiding the starving world should not be considered a Government and should not be allowed to continue." But have we realized
the implications of this revolutionary statement ? The United Kingdom is far from being self-sufficient in foodstuffs. We depend, and are likely to continue depending for some
time to come, on imports. Purchasing powers and ours are not what they were-will not,
if the new code is adopted, be the sole determinants of the movement of food stocks about the world. If priorities are strictly decided, not by purchasing powers but by needs, the marginal state of the populations of Asia is likely to keep our wives, and perhaps our
daughters, standing in queues for many years to come.
Moreover, new policies, if successful, will have an obvious first result. The total popu-

lation of Asia will increase as those of India and Formosa have increased. To acquire the necessary purchasing power, these countries will industrialize themselves as Japan has done, and will follow her footsteps in the demographic cycle. They will pass from the early into the late expanding phase, and birth-rates will begin to fall. But what will be the size of the population of Asia by the time she has reached the low stationary levels of the Western world ? And how long will this transition take? No one can to-day answer these momentous questions. But it is an encouraging sign that demographically enlightened people in Asiatic countries are appreciating the need for active measures to reduce fertility.
Thus, to quote again from the report of the authoritative Health Survey and Development Committee of India, published in I946:
313. All of us are agreed that, when childbearing is likely to result in injury to mother or infant, there is every justification for the practice of contraception. In such cases it should be the

responsibility of Governments to provide instruction regarding contraception in maternity and child welfare centres, dispensaries, hospitals, and any other public institutions which administer medical aid to women. We also consider that the supply of contraceptive requisites should be made, free of cost, by the State to necessitous women when the practice is advocated for reasons of health. There is also unanimity among us in respect of State action in two other directions, namely, (i) control over the manufacture and sale of contraceptives as in the case of food and drugs, and (2) assistance from public funds towards research for the production of a safe and effective contraceptive. (Vol. IV.)
The Committee continues to discuss how
far facilities for contraception should be pro-
vided on economic grounds (i.e. not solely on
grounds of health) ; but in this matter it
was divided. Among methods of reducing
fertility, it discusses the need of improving
the standards of living and of raising the age
of marriage of girls. But as a first consequence of these enlightened recommenda-
tions, it thinks that " the rate of growth of

STAGES IN POPULATION GROWTH

ioi

the population may show an acceleration as
compared with the past." The fact remains that the Committee,
in the new health services for India which it has mapped out, wishes to see included measures for reducing fertility. Surely we have here grounds for encouragement. If the very high fertility rates of Asia are reduced only as a quasi-automatic byproduct of industrial development, then
changes must be slow. Wars in this century are waged by machines which only industrialized countries can produce. The industrialization of Asia and the swarming of her populations may together incline men's thoughts to war. Can Asia's demographic transition be effected peacefully ? If further major wars in the West can be averted, this will surely be the problem which will most preoccupy our children's generation.
The recommendations of the Health Survey and Development Commission of India introduce a beam of hope into an otherwise forbidding picture. No country in the world has yet made it an article of national policy deliberately to reduce fertility. Who can foretell the results? If a Health Service were set up which made it the duty of those responsible for Maternity and Child Welfare to give to every woman delivered of a child information on how to space or prevent further pregnancies, there might result an accelerated passage through the late expanding to the low stationary phase of the

demographic cycle. The dire consequences of a prolonged transition might be averted.
There is surely another direction in which Asiatic countries might be helped, namely the development of women's movements. A feature of communities in the low stationary phase of the demographic cycle is the enfranchisement of their women who play an increasingly active part in their countries' cultural life. If the women of India, China and the Mohammedan countries were to rise to their opportunities, drawing inspiration from the achievements of their sisters in the West, the rest of the world would rejoice.
The countries of Asia are rapidly emerging from their colonial or semi-colonial status and are becoming autonomous powers. Their problems will be for them and not for us to solve. But sympathy and encouragement, perhaps also practical guidance, should not come amiss if tactfully offered.
For the East's problems are now those of the West also. In a world wherein peace is indivisible, the calamity which, on the threshold of a uranium age, threatens an ever more thickly populated world with a scarcely imaginable holocaust, will engulf East and West together. All will be its victims.
I am indebted to the following for helpful criticisms of an early draft: Dr. D. V. Glass, Mr. Geoffrey Eley, Mr. Roy Glenday, Mr. B. S. Bramwell and Dr. Maurice Newfield.
