THE EUGENICS REVIEW

the relatively large family size of the two matings
may have a purely psychological or socialbiological and not a genetic determination.
In the study which the author has carried
out he thought it worth while to prepare similar tables to those of Angel for an obese population
and a control population. The obese population were selected on the
basis of the obesity of one of the offspring (see below) and the propositus is left out of the offspring figures in the table. The control population was a population of factory women (see below). Again the propositus was omitted from the table.
The consistency of the Fat/thin ratio in Fat x Fat mating in this British data and the earlier work in the literature is striking. The sex-ratios and family size do not show consistency and are different from Angel's data. This suggests that variable social factors underlie these
differences. Steinberg"1 in a recent review describes such
approaches as the above as anecdotal. He takes this position because he sees quite correctly that obesity is not an all or none clinical condition. He presents a definition of obesity as an excessive accumulation of fat-beyond 10-20 per cent of the normal range for a particular age, height and sex. In presenting this definition Steinberg is emphasizing that obesity involves a continuous variable. In his definition this is *represented byfatness which varies continuously throughout the population. There are other definitions which regard the obese as those who

are over 20 per cent overweight. Here again a continuous variable is spoken of. Genetically such conditions are believed to be due to a series
of genes with additive or multiplicative effect or both, and are believed to vary with certain environmental factors. The phenotype that one studies is a product ofa varyingmultifactorial genetic situation developing in varyingenvironments.
In animal and plant populations such genetic situations can be studied by experimental breeding. The influence of genetic factors in milk yield can be studied by complex breeding and
interbreeding within herds. In human populations such techniques are not available. There-
fore special devices have to be sought in place of experimental breeding.
A number ofpossible solutions to this problem were mentioned by Steinberg and they include:
1. Twin Studies: Identical (Monozygous)
twins can be compared with Dizygous twins and with ordinary siblings. Moreover, if a sample of identical twins reared apart can be studied then some idea of the environmental component can be obtained.
2. Family Correlations: If the continuous variable can be corrected for height, age and sex then correlation coefficients could be computed between relatives so that family correlations would show genetic resemblances between the relatives. These would hold on the assumption of random mating, although it is worth pointing out at the beginning that psychological factors respecting body build almost certainly affect the choice of mate.

PROBLEMS IN THE GENETICS OF HUMAN OBESITY

3. Enviromnental Studies: Apart from the use
of twin studies for examining environmental factors there is still the problem of the magnitude of environmental influences on the correlations between relatives. This could be studied by the use of parent-child correlations in a parentadoptee population. Here any such correlation must be due either to bias in the selection of the child by the adopting parents (which in Britain is negligible because of our adoption system) or to environmental factors such as family eating patterns. I have used this method as will be seen later. Steinberg is attempting to investigate this by studying a group called the Hutterites-an Anabaptist sect which lives in a fairly stable environment sharing the same food, clothes and living a communal life. So far he has not reported any findings from this study.
The Phenotype Given a metric of some sort which can be used as synonymous with obesity an attempt can be made to see how much of the variation in this metric can be associated with genetic factors. In so far as the metric must be something which is correctable for height, weight and age, many of the more natural measurements associated with obesity cannot at the moment be used because of a lack of correcting factor. For example, several suggestions have been made in the literature for indices of adiposity. Total body fat could be used, or some anthropometric measure of body fat. Unfortunately at the moment there are no comprehensive tables of standards for such indices available. This is why Steinberg's suggested definition is not
helpful at,,he present time. On the other hand in-
surance companies find it worth making those people who are overweight pay an increased premium for their obesity. It was therefore decided to take overweight as the phenotypic characteristic. When the question is asked "overweight with respect to what" ? Two answers might be given. Firstly, on the basis of table of life expectancy the insurance companies have evolved the concept of "ideal weight". This concept is related both to life expectancy and the amount of profit which such companies make in
handling particular mortality risks. It is also worth noting that ideal weights for heights and

ages over thirty years are very much lower than the average weight at that height and age. A person of average weight at forty-five years of age would be more than 20 per cent overweight with reference to ideal weight at that age. It was decided to use average weight based on the table for the British population drawn up by Kemsley12 when considering adults and the tables of Sutcliffe and Canham"3 for children. A given individual would be evaluated against these tables and a value-the percentage overweight could be assigned to him or her. It should be noticed that this percentage can be positive or negative, and in the latter case the person would in fact be underweight. However, for mathematical simplicity he would be treated as having negative overweight.
The Initial Population Two populations of working class women living in a south London suburb were studied. The first population consist of 130 consecutive obese patients attending a clinic for obesity at their local hospital. These were compared with 250 women volunteers working at factories in the neighbourhood. It was felt that such a control population would be a sample of women from the population of which the obese group were drawn. It included women of all types of body build. The factory doctor was asked to obtain volunteers for research into what was in the diet which affects health. This form of invitation was used in the hope that the sample would not be unduly biased with respect to weight. The volunteers represented about half the available population at each factory.
When each -propositus was seen, whether they were from the obese or control populations it was explained to them that the author was interested in the way in which their eating habits ran through their family and an attempt was made to obtain their permission for all their first degree relatives to be contacted and visited. About fifty of the control population refused this permission. Further information was lost through some of the relatives refusing to cooperate when they were contacted, but this applied only to 23 per cent of the relatives of either group.

The ten major adoption societies in this country were contacted but only one, Dr. Barnado's, would co-operate. This Society sent a form to ail parents who had adopted children who would be from 8-13 years old. Three hundred forms were sent out, and 142 were returned to me from parents who remained anonymous so far as I was concerned. Forty-two forms were returned as unknown at the address sent.
The parent/offspring correlation coefficient were calculated and can be compared with those obtained for the factory population.

owing to the shortage of fathers who made themselves available for interview, and it was decided to seek a larger sample elsewhere. A
sample of children aged 10-18 from boys' and girls' schools in a London borough, Watford, was taken. The children were given a form on
which they had to fill in their own height, age and weight and those of their first degree relatives. This was presented to them through the schools with an injunction as to necessary accur-
acy and the research spirit behind the investigation. This yielded a large population whose family correlations were calculated.

This pattern of significant correfations sug-
gests that one of the factors is sex-linked. If this is the case, as Mather and Jinks'7 have shown the
relation r5/, > rb/b > rs/ should hold, assuming
that the effects of the autosomal genes and nonheritable agencies are the same for both sexes.

This does not confirm the hypothesis of sexlinkage. It was felt that perhaps because many in this population were children undergoing

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

their adolescent growth spurt this might upset the comparison of their weight with that of adults. Therefore the correlations were calculated for two sub-group groups.
(a) leaving out those children who were under 15 years of age. (b) leaving out those children aged from 10-18 years.

It is interesting that on the restricted sample the mother/son correlation becomes not significantly different from zero. In fact, however, the value is only just not significant so that a sample as large as the total sample might have a significant correlation. It is worth pointing out that in these children the father/son correlation is not

significant and is low, so that the original positive correlation based on a very small sample is
possibly fortuitous. This leads us to abandon the hypothesis of sex limitation.
The lack of support, however, for the sexlinkage hypothesis resulting from the sibling
correlations requires that a closer examination of the concept of overweight be made. Overweight can be due to a number of factors associated with body build. From the point of view of obesity a clinician means that overweight must be due to an excess of fat. Whereas overweight may be due to an excess of muscle or bone. In somatotype terminology, the clinician is interested in obesity as in endomorphy, whereas overweight may be the result of a high degree of mesomorphy.
The original sample of factory women and their families had been measured for their somatotype by Parnell's method. An attempt was also made to get some picture of the somatotype of the schoolchildren and their families by giving them a choice of types of body build as a description and asking them to use such descriptions to classify the build of their relatives and them-

The figures can be seen in a diagram in Figure 5. The populations have been shown separately for one has actually been measured, the schoolchildren are inferred. The latter is open to serious bias including psychological bias which has vitiated other work done on similar lines.
There are differences in these diagrams which need more accurate and larger samples for their clarification, but two things stand out:
(1) in neither case does the father contribute ectomorphy to the son. (2) the sex cross correlations, i.e. mother/son and father/daughter are basically different. The mother contributes at least her endomorphy to the son, whereas the father is contributing mesomorphy to the daughter.
From this it can be seen that the cross correlations which we saw for overweight must have a different basis. They must be based on the mesomorphy relationship for the father/daughter correlation, and on the endomorphy relationship for the mother/son correlation. It looks as
