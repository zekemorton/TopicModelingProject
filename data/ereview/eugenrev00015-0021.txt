THE EUGENICS REVIEW

To distinguish between these alternatives, further information about the social circumstances and the reproductive histories of the families would be needed, much of which is already documented in the vital registrations, census enumerations and elsewhere. There is no certainty, of course, that genetic factors play any substantial role in the causation of these particular conditions, but the examples serve nevertheless to illustrate

the ways in which biases can arise. Similar interactions appear to be quite common (Table 4).-
Of less obvious origins are the increased risks of strabismus, or "squint", and of certain "other" congenital malformations of the nervous system and sense organs among children of higher birth orders (Table 1) which might, if birth orders were not taken into consideration in the analysis, appear as maternal age effects

of kinds that would mimic the consequences of mutations accumulating in the female germ cells. Genetic causes of another sort might conceivably be involved, since maternal/foetal incompatibilities could very well be operating to increase the likelihood of sensitization of mothers of higher parities, thereby increasing the risks to offspring of higher birth orders. Such effects would not, of course, indicate any influence of parental ageing as such.
Of the increased risks shown to be associated primarily with advancing age of mother, that of mongolian idiocy is known already to be mutational in origin, while that of cerebral palsy could perhaps be attributed to the changes in intra-uterine environment that occur in older mothers. Evidence to rule out such an effect of the prenatal environment is not wholly unobtainable, but would require another generation of pedigree information to permit comparison of the risks in the current generation of children for different ages of the maternal grandmother
where the mother's age is not a variable. No one has seriously attempted to carry out such multi-generation comparisons on any substantial scale as relating to particular diseases or groups of diseases, although data have been obtained on correlations of the grandmaternal age with the sex ratio, of a kind indicating possible differences in prenatal mortality due to lethal mutation in the sex chromosomes.2 Extensions of the approach to include mortality and morbidity of children, specific by disease or broad category of disease, would require application of pedigree information of a kind

that is already contained in the accumulated vital records of most countries, but on a scale
that would heretofore have seemed impracticable
in the extreme.
Observed correlations of risks with advancing age of the father at the time of the birth, in-
dependent of the mother's age, cannot, of course, be attributed in the above manner to a
changing intra-uterine environment, but other difficulties of interpretation present themselves.
One such correlation, involving the risk of congenital malformation, and more particularly
the group of such conditions known in the International Classification as other congenital malformations of the nervous system and sense
organs, might perhaps be genuinely indicative of increased mutant frequencies in gametes
from ageing fathers (Table 1). However, a similarly increased risk of diseases of the respiratory system (mainly deaths from pneumonia and bronchitis) which has been observed among offspring from older fathers seems quite unlikely to be mutational in origin (Tables 1 and 5). A relatively simple explanation is in this instance apparent from examination of the
data; most of the deaths from respiratory diseases among British Columbia children occur
in North American Indians, and Indian fathers tend to be older than is usual for the rest of the population. The correlation disappears when the data are broken down by Indian versus non-Indian parentage.
Findings of this sort emphasize the importance of distinguishing those correlations with paternal or with maternal age that are secondary in nature, and that depend on differences in the

ER-I

115

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

parental age distribution for population subgroups within which the risks may be higher
or lower than for the population as a whole. The principal limiting factor in the identification of such non-mutational effects is not the amount of recorded knowledge of social characteristics, which is really quite extensive. Rather, it is the mechanical difficulty of bringing together such recorded information, as relating to particular individuals, and of doing so on a large enough scale to permit multiple breakdown of the data without spreading them too thinly between the resulting pigeon-holes or matrix cells.
To complicate matters still further, the extent of the difference between the age of the father

and that of the mother, is itself correlated with the risk of infant death (Table 6), an effect which is presumably likewise associated with population heterogeneities involving simultaneously the ages of the parents and the risks to the children.
This relatively long list of the difficulties that
besets attempts to derive information about the importance of mutation from studies of parental age correlations may at first sight seem discouraging in the extreme. And yet, it is doubtful if there are any better approaches, and we are still in the happy position of having potentially available to us a vastly greater body of recorded personal information, of strictly relevant kinds, than anyone has so far attempted to analyze.

Consideration of some of the possible causes of such an association serves to illustrate the complexities that are introduced into selection studies whenever environmental factors may be involved. From the standpoint of the mother,

the loss of a child from postnatal asphyxia is probably not so very different from having a
stillborn child, or from the death of a child shortly after birth from erythroblastosis or haemorrhagic disease. It seems unlikely, there-
fore, that the effects on her reproductive
behaviour will be strikingly different in the case of postnatal asphyxia. The true reason for the association with an elevated fertility might therefore be that his latter condition tends to
occur preferentially in an unusually fertile subgroup of the population.
This view is supported in the case of postnatal asphyxia by evidence from the parental age and birth order studies discussed earlier. The
risk was shown to be substantially elevated

among children of very young mothers when contributions from birth order effects were excluded, and also among children of higher

t Previous data (Newcombe 11) cases are limited to birth orders 1 to 4 inclusive.

immediate task is the fuller utilization of the information that is already potentially available, on a scale appropriate to permit multiple breakdowns of the data.
As a minor refinement in the present study, the effective fertilities of the mothers in terms of the numbers of offspring surviving to the end of the period under consideration have been derived for the four conditions, erythroblastosis, haemorrhagic disease, postnatal asphyxia and mongolism (Table 11). When this is done, a slight reduction of fertility is observed in the case of the first two conditions, and a slight increase in the case of the other two.
Further attempts to interpret the observed effects would be unprofitable at this stage when we have only just started to describe them. The study so far has considered only five conditions, only 500 to 600 affected infants, and the reproductive performances of the mothers over a period of only four years maximum. The methods are applicable equally to conditions of other kinds and to much larger numbers of families followed over much longer time spans.
Disease Conditions for which Studies of Mutation and Selection are Profitable
The empirical data yielded by studies of mutation and selection are, of course, most simply interpreted where the traits under investigation are readily recognizable, are determined by single gene differences and are always expressed when the causal gene is present. For this reason, such studies have in the past tended to make use of a few quite rare genetic traits that come

reasonably close to meeting the ideal specifications. Achondroplastic dwarfism and Huntington's chorea are examples in point. While appropriate for establishing genetic principles, this sort of approach concentrates, as it were, on a small and unrepresentative part of the total genetic variability affecting man's well-being.
At the other end of the spectrum, attempts to estimate the likely total magnitudes of the consequences of mutation and of selection have sometimes been based on gross mortality data, not subdivided at all by disease cause.2, 5
In between the two extremes there is a wide range of possible lines of study awaiting exploration, information on which is abundantly available even if a little tricky to get at. While routine records such as those of deaths and of hospital discharges are correctly regarded as inefficient sources of ascertainments of cases of the rarer genetic diseases, they do contain diagnoses of other sorts of conditions that are appropriate for studies either of mutation or of selection. Verylarge numbers of blood groupings, for example, are recorded annually in hospitals and as a part of the running of blood banks and transfusion services. Cases of important diseases that are partially genetic in origin and inherited in an irregular fashion are likewise reasonably well documented, although not necessarily in any single set of files; diabetes, idiopathic epilepsy and certain of the congenital malformations being notable examples. A number of the metrical, or quantitative, traits of man, of kinds that are suitable for studies of selection pressures, are likewise widely recorded; examples include birth weight which is stated on virtually all birth registrations, intelligence which is
121

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

measured routinely in many school systems, and arterial pressure which is commonly taken in the
course of medical examinations. The possible applications of linkages with
family pedigree information, such as may be obtained from the vital registrations, varies somewhat with the nature of the trait under study. In the case of the blood groups an important aim is the detection of correlations with fertility, mortality and morbidity, which will help to account for the continued prevalence of a diversity of gene alleles. In the case of birth weight variations there is a rather special unsolved problem, in that the modal value differs unexpectedly from the selective optimum as judged from the abilities of the infants to survive the first year of life.3 There are also special problems associated with the study of selection as relating to intelligence and school performance, in that most investigations have in the past been concerned mainly with a single generation of test scores. The refinements that might derive from use on a substantial scale of two or more generations of scores within the same pedigrees, to help disentangle a transmissible component in mental ability from the

more obviously environmental components for the purposes of selection studies, has hardly been explored at all even in theoretical discussions of the degree of precision that might eventually be possible.
For the diseases that display irregular inherit-
ance another sort of problem arises, that bears on the manner in which tests for selective pressures may be designed, and that can in part be investigated by the use of pedigree information. Because of the nature of these
conditions, many of the carriers of the causal genes may not be affected, and still others may have diseases that do not especially resemble the usual expressions of the genes. A few aetiological associations between outwardly diverse traits of an hereditary or partially hereditary sort have already been established, as in the case of spina bifida and anencephalus, and where these exist it is desirable to study the effects of selection on all of the known expressions of the underlying causal factors.
That such aetiological groupings may perhaps be more common than has been recognized in the past is suggested by a recent study of the risks of death and disease among the brothers

suggested, the influences that determine our genetic future.
Summary
Studies of mutation and selection, as influencing the genetically simple traits of man, have been popular in the past but they tell little about the overall magnitudes of the effects of these two forces throughout the genome as a whole. Similar studies would be desirable, relating to the collectively more important characteristics of man that are less simply inherited, and that are determined by combinations of environmental and hereditary factors. But such work is beset with difficulties arising out of the numerous environmental inhomogeneities characteristic of human populations. To be interpretable, data from these more difficult sorts of investigations must be broken down by a multiplicity of social variables; and correspondingly larger amounts of data are needed to make possible the required multivariate approach.
An abundance of relevant information about people is in fact recorded, which we have only begun to tap, describing not only their biological characteristics and family relationships, but their social circumstances as well. Application of this body of knowledge depends largely upon bringing together, or "linking", the separately recorded facts about the same individuals and families. Such "record linkages" will have many uses if the process of linking can be made cheap enough and rapid enough. In the long run, understanding of the magnitudes of the effects of recurrent mutations, and of various selective forces, on the quality of the human gene pool may depend upon the use of such methodological developments to take maximum advantage of information we already possess.
