A NOTE ON THE INTELLECTUAL DIFFERENCES OF THE SEXES
By B. S. BRAMWELL, M.A., F.R.S.E.

IS there a discernible difference in the
mental make-up of the two sexes? It
occurred to me some time ago that the Cambridge Tripos lists would repay study. This paper is an abbreviation of the full results of my inquiry.
Since i88o or thereabouts the numbers of women competing for honours have grown to considerable figures. Have the numbers in any particular subject tended to increase more than in others? And do women fare relatively better or worse than men and this in very varying studies ? Any conclusions, however, must be tempered by the fact that female education is still largely dominated at the top by the male, and certainly the examination papers in the various triposes are mostly set by men, for men and corrected by men.
The period I investigated first was from i88o to I9IO. I divided it into three periods. I9II to I920 was broken by the war and, at the time of my examination, the later decades had not been completed.
Let us look at the Mathematical Tripos, taking first mere quantity. The technique I have followed is to put down the numbers of men and women, total them and then express each as a percentage of the whole.

The number of men taking the tripos has fallen in each decade. The number of women
increased considerably in the second decade.
Women formed 8 per cent of the candidates in the first decade, i6 per cent in the second and 20 per cent in the third.
The classes taken by the candidates are set out in the following tables.

At this stage it is possible to draw some tentative conclusions. Both the fall in the number of men and the increase in the number of women appear to have been among the more indifferent candidates.
Perhaps this will be clearer from the percentage figures for women alone. If women were equal to men in aptitude for mathematics and in mathematical training, one should find that the percentage in each class was the same as the percentage in the total.

As a " first vintage " we may say that, for some reason or reasons unknown, women are
perhaps not so well adapted to pursue mathematics as men.

The subject does not seem to have offered much attraction to either sex. So the figures are small. They do not suggest any very marked difference between the two sexes.
The Economics Tripos covers only six
years: the total figures are only 6i. For what they are worth they do not suggest much difference between the two sexes.
The women's percentages are:

Looking at mere numbers, the women have increased most numerically in the Medieval and Modem Languages Tripos. This seems wise on their part, for our figures certainly suggest that they do better in this subject than the men. In the History Tripos their numbers in the third decade were more than three times those in the first decade and here again they have done well. In the Natural Science Tripos their increase has been proportionate to that of the men. In the Mathematical Tripos and the Classical Tripos, there has been an increase but of a lesser magnitude. These are the subjects in which they seem to have done worst. In the Moral Science Tripos, their numbers like those of the men are nearly stationary. So on the whole their selection of subjects seems wise.
When one comes to quality it is not so easy to dogmatize. In Mathematics and Classics the men have undoubtedly a greater percentage of firsts and a smaller percentage of thirds. In History and Medieval and Modem Languages the position is reversed. In Science men have a greater proportion of firsts but have if anything done rather worse than the women at the other end of the scale. The same seems true of Moral Science to a lesser degree but the total figures involved are very small.
We can get some further data as regards the relative position of men and women in the first class of the Mathematical and

Classical Tripos. Until the final year of our period candidates in the Mathematical Tripos were placed in order of merit. Thirty-
one women were so placed amongst the Wranglers the number of whom was generally between 25 and 35; the mean therefore was not very different from thirty-one.

7 women ranked in the first ten 6 ,, ,, , , second ten I7 , , , , third ten and i woman of ,, ,, fourth ten
Other things being equal, the expectation would be an even distribution of io throughout.
In the Classical Tripos the First Class is divided into three divisions. During the period I2I men and 5 women were placed in I. i. From the relative numbers taking the Tripos one would have expected to find I5 women so placed.
We might try and give an average figure for all candidates and compare that figure for men and women candidates. Supposing we allow 3 marks for a first, 2 for a second and i for a third, total them and divide by the number of candidates. How far this would make a comparison of much value, I cannot say, but for what it is worth, here are the figures.

So much for the Cambridge figures for the period i88o to I9I0. We must not stretch conclusions too far from the results. Exami-
nations have a proved correlation to after-
success in life, but of what magnitude? When all is said and done I think we may be justified in expecting to find some sex
difference in aptitude, say for the study of Mathematics and of Modem Languages.
Our conclusions may be tested by considering other periods and other places.
I examined the Oxford Historical Register I900-I920 and extracted the figures for this period (I90I-I920) from the honours lists. There are four classes at Oxford as against

three at Cambridge. The totals for the 20 years are as follows:

Some deductions may be drawn from these lists. Taking the percentage of the total as
a standard, in no list did the women make their percentage in the first class; in every list they slightly exceeded it in the second class; in the fourth class they only exceeded
their percentage in one case out of six.
I made out a table as before, to demon-
strate in a rough and ready way, the average class taken by men and women. As there are four classes, I allocated 4 points for a first,
3 for a second, 2 for a third and I for a fourth class.
The results are as follows:

As to choice of subjects, very few women took Mathematics, possibly wisely as not one
of the 2I women candidates got a first class, whereas roughly 40 per cent of the men
achieved this distinction. On the other hand, more women took Modern History than any other subject and in this subject they did
very well. Except in one instance (Lit. Hum.)
these results are quite in accord with those of Cambridge, two-thirds of which referred
to an earlier date.

Finally I examined the Cambridge lists for
the period I93I to I939. Numbers of candidates had greatly increased. I have omitted the Moral Science Tripos, as the number of candidates during the period was only 52 (4I men and ii women). I included the
Economics Tripos where the numbers are now considerable.

Comparing this with the previous table which refers to a much earlier period there

is very little difference. The Oxford table

too differs only markedly in the position of

the Classics, but here we are not really

comparing similar things. When we come to consider Nature and

Nurture we must be guarded. The results

observed seem to persist irrespective of time and place. In the case of Mathematics the

differences in favour of the male are too striking to be explained entirely by Nurture. Why should we suppose he has been better

taught over a period of 6o years when we

do not have a similar discrepancy in other subjects? In these we nearly always find

women are below their quota in the First Class and also the Third Class. Languages seem to be *an exception. It looks as if

women here did better than men. Other-

wise, women seem to cluster more closely round their mean. It may be that there

is more inducement for the best men to

go " all out " for a high place though this

is rather doubtful. I think it is probable that women are more conscientious than men, many of whom are distracted from their work by the inducements of sport and games,
success in which for men contemplating teaching as a profession may even have a commercial value. I am inclined to think that the men tend to show what are generally considered to be Nordic characteristics and the women those considered Mediterranean.
The ultimate career of the women gradu-
ates would make an interesting study. From the lists of graduate members of Girton and Newnham in the latest Cambridge Calendar, one gathers that one third of them have married. As these lists include many who have just recently graduated, it is probable that the marriages are far from complete. So probably more than 40 per cent marry. If it be true, as is said, that 50 per cent of girl babies born eventually marry, then over 6o per cent. of girls reaching the age of 20 will marry, which is undoubtedly a much higher marriage rate. What size of families have women graduates? I think we should mostly anticipate small; but without knowing such a guess might be hazardous. Casting my mind over cases well known to me, the first four which occurred to me averaged families of five!
