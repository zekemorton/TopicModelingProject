Population Control in Japan: Lessons for India*

THE SHARP DECLINE in Japan's crude birth rate of 344 in 1947 to 17-2 in 1957 is unique in the demographic history of the world. Why and how did the Japanese birth rate fall so steadily in such a short period? What lessons, if any, has the Japanese experience of population control to offer to India?
Japan is the only nation in Asia that has achieved both a demographic transition and a substantial measure of economic development. During the last quarter of the nineteenth century she had birth rates "not much below" 40 per 1,000 population19 as compared with an estimated birth rate above 45 per 1,000 for India for the same period.1 The practice of family limitation by infanticide in Japan was reported

Factors affecting Fertility
The fall in Japanese fertility may be attributed to the following factors:
First, socio-economic factors such as industrialization, urbanization, employment ofwomen in non-agricultural occupations, increasing literacy, development of transport and communications systems and the absence of glaring cultural differences in the Japanese population were all influential in inducing a decline in Japanese fertility. Though some of these factors are now present in India they have not yet helped towards a fertility decline, as I have pointed out elsewhere.16
Second, the psychological impact of the defeat of Japan in the Second World War, the loss of an empire and the desire to regain the pre-war standard of living, and even to raise it, provided further incentives to Japanese couples to limit their families.
Third, since there was already an established tradition of family limitation, the Japanese were not reluctant to make use of any available technique to help them to limit their families.
Fourth, the Japanese Government, which had always viewed family limitation with disfavour, assumed a permissive attitude in such matters in 1948.
We may discuss these matters in more detail.

to have been the reason for this disparity between the two countries. During the period 1921-61 the difference in birth rates between India and Japan widened, as is shown in Figure 1. The slight increase in birth rates in Japan in the period 1941-51 was due to the pro-natalist policy of the Japanese Government during the Second World War period.

Socio-economic Factors
As in most of the western nations, the most important factor leading to a fertility decline in Japan was economic development and the associated industrialization. In other words, fertility decline did not happen in a static

most other countries in their pre-industrial stage. Literature available on the family limitation practices ofthe Japanesefrom the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries suggests that infanticide (mabiki, originally meaning "thinning seedlings") and abortion were commonly practised.18 So much so, that in the seventeenth century, the Government of Japan used priests, preachers and teachers to discourage the people from committing infanticide. With the same purpose, devout Buddhist peasants were encouraged to settle down in areas where infanticide was widespread. As to contraceptives, abortion and infanticide "there was no sharp differentiation among the three as biological procedures or ethical concepts",19 and hence it was immaterial which method was used for limiting families.
This tradition of family limitation was totally lacking in India where familistic and other values put a premium on large families.
The Government and Population Control
There was also in Japan a tradition of governmental interference in matters of population growth, either to discourage certain techniques of family limitation or to encourage the growth of population. This was quite unknown in India before 1952. The measures adopted in the seventeenth century by the Japanese Government to prevent infanticide have already been mentioned. In 1927, in view of the increasing population, the Government of Japan created a Department of Overseas Affairs to promote emigration from Japan and a Commissioner was appointed to study the problems of population and food supply. In the early 1940s "all measures conducive to the limitation of the size of the family were placed under strict official denunciation".18
During the American occupation, the problem of population growth in Japan received widespread publicity because of certain actions of the Government. For instance, since it was believed by the occupation authorities that permission given to Mrs. Margaret Sanger to visit the country might be interpreted by the Japanese as an attempt to interfere in their population policy, the Supreme Commander of Allied

Powers (SCAP), General Douglas MacArthur,
refused permission for her to visit Japan in
1949. It was at this time that SCAP's Natural
Resources Section prepared and published a
report containing an analysis of the natural
resources of Japan. The report stated that "the
population problem was part of the resources
problem, and that the problem created by
reduced death rates could hardly be solved
humanely except through reduced birth rates".19 The publication of this statement was protested
against by some Catholic organizations in Tokyo. As a result MacArthur assured the Japanese
that "decisions thereon [matters of population
control] rest entirely with the Japanese them-
selves .... Birth control with its social, economic and theological sides, is in final analysis, for individual judgement and decision".19 After this assurance, copies of the Report on Natural Resources were recalled and the "offending" passages were expunged. These actions made the issue a lively topic of discussion even in the remote corners of Japan. Thus the people became increasingly informed and aware of the nature of the population problem their country faced.
Though for several reasons population control had become a controversial issue in India in the 1940s and the 1950s, since the literacy rates were low and facilities for communication inadequate, the participants in the discussion were few.
In May 1948, the Eugenic Protection Law permitted induced abortions in Japan in the case of "a mother whose health may be affected seriously by delivery, from the physical or economic viewpoint" ;6 a qualitative excuse thus being given to a decision which dealt with a primarily quantitative problem. Thus in matters of birth control the Japanese Government came to assume a permissive role; and that was sufficient for the married couples of Japan who were highly motivated to limit their families. The lack of sophistication in the method of birth control known-abortion-provided little obstacle to the determination of the Japanese to curtail fertility. The effect on their birth rate was immediate and drastic.
Hitherto, the illegal nature of surgical abortion as a method of family limitation was the barrage

19

THE EUGENICS REVIEW

that prevented many people from matching the desired number of children with the actual number. When all of a sudden this barrage was
swept away, the birth rate came tumbling down at a rate quite unprecedented in the demographic history of any nation.
The next step was to set up, in 1949, a Population Problems Council in the Japanese Cabinet which recommended the dissemination of family planning information. The recommendation was not acceptable to the Government of Japan and the Council was dissolved within the year. Nevertheless, the birth rate continued to fall and remained at 25 3 in 1951 as compared to 34-4 in 1947, primarily due to the increased

First, although from an ethical point of view, Japanese culture does not differentiate between the use of infanticide, abortion and contraception for preventing births, in the process of Westernization, certain elements of Western thought, such as a greater concern for the born than for the unborn, penetrated into Japanese culture and, as a result, abortion appeared to be less immoral than the old practice of infanticide.
Second, since Japanese couples took full advantage of the extensive system of social insurance, the cost of an induced abortion was less in many cases than the cost of using even the cheapest of contraceptives: for example, the

popularity of contraception as seen from Table 2 and Figure 2.
The strong motivation of Japanese couples to limit their families is indicated in two ways by
the table and the figure. (a) The closeness of the percentages for con-
traceptive knowledge and practice reveals that
most of the Japanese couples who knew of contraception did attempt it.
(b) The increasing rate of induced abortions, along with an increasing percentage of couples practising family limitation, suggests that in spite of contraceptive failures-which must have been common-the Japanese couples did not give up their decision to limit their families.
During the period 1957-59, for every birth prevented by contraception, 2 5 births (based on reported rates of abortion) were prevented by abortion. It might also be remembered that by 1957-59, 63 per cent of the couples had practised, or were practising contraception.6

Because of the aforementioned factors, when the Eugenic Protection Law of 1948 also allowed abortion on socio-economic grounds, abortion was used on a large scale. In 1952, 68-4 per cent of all Japanese wives had not experienced an abortion; but by 1961 their percentage fell to 35.6.15
Contraceptives were, however, also used because information on birth control was readily available and contraceptives of reliable quality were easily procurable and were within the means of average Japanese couples. However, an increase in artificial termination of pregnancy was taking place pari passu with increased

Lessons for India
Now, it might be asked whether the Japanese experience of population control has any lessons for India. The Japanese experience offers at least two suggestions in the preparation of blueprints for fertility control in India.
First, there is the lesson drawn from the demographic experiences of several Western countries that once the people develop a strong motivation for limiting the number of their children, irrespective of, or notwithstanding, the governmental attitude, and irrespective of the means to be used, families will be limited. This is reaffirmed by -the Japanese experience, and reminds us that one of the principal problems facing the Government of India in their efforts to make population control successful is the creation of a strong motivation for Indian couples to limit their families. Though some of the social,
economic and psychological factors which were so influential in Japan are making their appearance in India, they are not yet strong enough to influence the trend ot fertility in the downward
direction. The Government of India must there-
fore create or strengthen this motivation by providing economic incentives for those who limit their families and disincentives for those
