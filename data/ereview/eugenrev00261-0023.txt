ESTIMATES OF FUTURE POPULATIONS OF VARIOUS COUNTRIES*
By D. V. GLASS

T HE object of this brief collection of
statistics and notes is to provide some basis for discussion of possible, trends of population in the next forty years. The data cover sets of twenty-eight estimates, mainly published after I930, showing a wide range of hypotheses and methods of calculation. None of the estimates, however, takes into account the possible effects of war. The commentaries give a resume of methodology and hypotheses, and the reader may thus judge the relative merits of the various estimates. The appended tables summarize the results, in terms of total populations, as far as the year I980. Many of the estimates were continued far beyond that

point, but estimates are ephemeral (save for theoretical discussion) and the population data for subsequent years have not been given. The annotations indicate, however,
the ultimate points of time to which the computations were originally taken. Where
estimates are based on more than one set of hypotheses, the alternative results are given. The range between the " most pessimistic " and the " most optimistic " results is in some way a measure of the margin -of indeterminateness involved in such calculations and an indication of the danger of regarding estimates as if they were prophecies. In the tables, the estimated future populations are accompanied by statistics of actual populations for the years for which- they are available.
* This material was originally prepared as an
Appendix to Population Policies and Movements (Oxford University Press, 1940), but was omitted for lack of space. No substantial changes have been made in the presentation, save to exclude the data on the United States and on Japan. It is hoped, however, to deal with these countries later, and also to publish a discussion of estimates and estimation in general.

tality as the population of England and
Wales in I935. 3. Estimate III extrapolates recent trends
in fertility and mortality, assuming that
fertility ceases to fall by I960 and mortality
by I970. In extrapolating mortality, the generation method was taken into account,
leading to ultimate expectations of life at
birth of 67.67 years for males and 70.I5 years for females for I970 and subsequent
years. In extrapolating specific fertility rates (estimated), the diagonal fall by age
shown in many countries was taken into account, the fall being thus assumed to be greater with each successive older age group.
The ultimate assumed gross reproduction rate is o. 6oo for I970 and subsequent years.
Mortality is assumed to fall until I970, S0 the net reproduction rate, which is 0. 559 in
I960-5, is 0.563 in I965-70 and o.566 from
I970 outwards. Migration is excluded. Computation is by five-year age groups, using survival ratios constructed from the life table populations. Births are computed by applying the assumed specific fertility rates to the average numbers of women in each of
the seven five-year age groups of the repro-
ductive period in each quinquennium. The resultant population data are by five-year age groups for five-year time intervals (midyear figures), calculated originally beyond the year 2ooo in all cases for reasons of theoretical interest.

the quinquennial method, in the same way as for the estimates noted in No. 2. Few data as to absolute populations are given, but some extra tables were later published in Charles, E., " The Effect of Present Trends in Fertility and Mortality upon the Future Population of Great Britain and upon its Age Composition" (in Political Arithmetic, edited by Lancelot Hogben, F.R.S., London, I938). In both the estimates the populations
were computed up to 2035. [7] Leybourne, G. G. " An estimate of the future population of Great Britain," Sociological Review, I934, pp. I30-8. The population of Scotland was estimated
separately from that of England and Wales, but the same methods and assumptions were
made in both cases. Legitimate and illegi-
timate general fertility rates were extrapolated by fitting straight lines to the data from I924-3I, but assuming that they would stabilize at the levels reached in I944. The married female population aged I5 to 44

years was estimated by fitting a straight line to the proportions which married women
formed of all women in the same age group in the years I924-3I, but assuming that stability was maintained at the level reached by I944. Mortality is apparently at the
I924-32 level. Computation appears to have been by single years of age from o to 4 years, for a single age group above 8o years, and by a quinquennial method for the intermediate years of age. The results are given in broad age groups, separately for males and females and for the two countries, by five-year time intervals from I93I to I956, and by ten-year time intervals from I956 to I976.

Births at pivotal years-I94I, I95I, I96I and I97I-were estimated by an extrapolation of the Registrar General's fertility rates
for I92I and I93I-the trend was assumed to be a fall every five years in geometric progression, in the ratio which the I93I rates bore to rates estimated for I926, the rates for Scotland according to age being proportionate to those for England and Wales. Illegitimate and legitimate births were dealt with separately but by the same method. Births for the pivotal years stated were computed by applying the estimated legitimate and illegitimate fertility rates to the subsequent populations of married and unmarried women. The married populations were ob-

tained by applying the I93I percentages of married women by age groups to the estimated future population, and then deriving the numbers of married men according to age on the basis of the I93I position. The I93I age distribution of wives was then applied to these men and a second estimate of married women obtained. The average of these two estimates was used. The births in the interpivotal years were obtained by interpolation. Mortality (in the form of survival factors) was estimated by fitting curves to the data of the English Life Tables, Nos. 6-io, with slight modifications based on the Scottish differences in I93I. Infant mortality was dealt with separately. The assumed expectations of life in I97I were 62 . 0 years for males and 66.o years for females, and the final net reproduction rate was 0.42. Migration was excluded. Computation (except for the ages o to 9 years) was by a quinquennial method. The results are given in five-year age groups, separately for males and females, and by ten-year intervals of time, from I93I to I97I.

Estimates are constructed on three sets of assumptions.
i. Assumes fertility will continue at its "present level," that mortality " will continue to fall," that there will be net inward migration until I94I-5I and no migration afterwards. This is the " standard " estimate.
2. Assumes the ultimate fertility reached in I97I will be io per cent higher and the ultimate mortality io per cent-lower than that postulated in the first estimate.
3. Assumes the ultimatelfertility reached will be I0 per cent lower and the ultimate mortality io per cent higher than in the first estimate.
For the first estimate the results are given by broad age groups at ten-year time intervals from I94I to 197I, sex being distin-

other estimates, only the total populations can be obtained (by means of deviations from
the first estimate).

Ist estimate.-Assumes the continuance of the specific fertility and mortality rates of I935-7. Migration is excluded.
2nd estimate.-Assumes the same fertility and mortality as in first estimate, but also postulates that net emigration in i936-46 will be about 8o per cent of that in i926-36, with the ratio falling to about 6o per cent in
I946-56, and 40 per cent thereafter.
3rd estimate.-Assumes that fertility would decline from the I935-7 rates up to i966 along the lines of the past thirty yearsi.e. no decline in the age group I5-I9 years, 2 per cent in the group 20-4, 5 per cent in each of the next three age groups, and 8 per cent in the age groups 40-4 and 45-9 years. For mortality it is assumed that the quinquennial survival ratios increase in each tenyear period of time up to I966 by the extent of the increase in the ratios between I926 and I936. The migration assumption is the same as for second estimate.
Computation was by five-year age groups, but the results are given only for broad age groupings, distinguishing the sexes. The results are given for every tenth year up to and including 2036.

years (apparently obtained by applying the
specific fertility rates of I925-7, but reducing
them so that the number of births computed for I93I equalled the average of the actual
births in I929-30).
2nd estimate.-Mortality as above. Fertility held constant at the rates obtaining in the Seine departement in I925-7 (but these fertility rates were not applied until I93I, for the populations at the beginning of I929, I930 and I93I, are the same as in the first
estinate). The populations of the first estimate are
given by five-year age groups (though appar-
ently calculated by single years of age) for January Ist of each year from I929 to I980. The results of the second estimate are given
for the same points of time, but only in broad age groups. In both estimates males and familes are distinguished. Migration is excluded from both estimates.
[I7] Sauvy, A. " Perspectives statistiques
sur la population, l'enseignement et le chomage," Journal de la Societe de Statistique de Paris, I937, pp. 227-4I. Ist estimate.-Fertility held constant at approximately the level of I935. (Estimated by reducing the specific fertility rates of
I930-4 so as to produce the births recorded in I935.) Mortality held constant at the
I935 level. 2nd estimate.-Fertility: assumes a con-
stant rate of decline in the specific fertility
rates equal to that observed in the period
I930-5. Mortality: constant rate of decline equal to the fall shown in the specific age rates in the previous ten years.
Births appear to have been calculated for each year, and the rest of the population by five-year age groups. Migration has not been taken into account in either estimate. The
results are given by five-year age groups, for January Ist, at the beginning of each fiveyear period from I935 to I985. The sexes are not distinguished in the published results.

2nd estimate.-Legitimate fertility remains constant at the level obtaining in
I924-5.
3rd estimate.-Legitimate fertility falls (with equal falls in each five-year age group from 20 to 44 years) by 25 per cent between I924-5 and I954-5, the fall describing a parabola of the third order. After I955 fertility remains constant.
In all three estimates mortality is held constant at the level of I92I-3; and the annual number of illegitimate live births is also held constant, apparently at the I923 level. Migration is not taken into account.

In calculating the number of potentially fertile married women, the ratio of women
aged 20-39 years to men aged 22-4I years
appears to have been taken into account, but there is no explicit statement of the method of estimation. The estimates are given by five-year age groups, for males and females separately, at five-year time intervals from I925 tO I935, and then by ten-year time intervals to I975, the results referring to the beginning of the year.
[i9] " Ausblick auf die zukiinftige Bevolkerungsentwicklung im Deutschen Reich," Statistik des Deutschen Reichs, Berlin, I930, 401, II, pp. 64I f., Appendix.
Ist estimate.-Assumes constant annual supply of live births at the level of I927 (approximately I,i60,ooo).
2nd estimate.-Assumes that legitimate and illegitimate fertility remain at the level of I927. The numbers of potentially fertile married women were computed, up to I940, by assuming the marriage frequencies of I9I0, and beyond I940 by using the ratio between men under 48 years to women under 45 years of age, though the method is not explicitly described.
3rd estimate.-Assumes a 25 per cent fall in legitimate and illegitimate fertility by I955 and then fertility remains constant. The fall in fertility is assumed to follow a curve of the type Qt-ab-tn. Married women were estimated in the same way as in the second estimate.
In all the above estimates, mortality was held constant at the level of I924-6. No results (apart from graphs) appear to have been published for the second estimate. For the first estimate, the results are given by five-year age groups and separately for males and females, for single-year intervals of time to I955, for five-year intervals to I980, and then for ten-year intervals to 2ooo. The results of the third estimate are also given by five-year age groups, but, in addition, by single years of age for the same time intervals as the first estimate. The results refer to the beginning of each year. Note also that the volume contains estimates, by sex, age (five-

ESTIMATES OF FUTURE POPULATIONS OF VARIOUS COUNTRIES 79

year groups) and five-year time intervals
from I920 or I925 to I960, of the future populations of France, Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Poland and the Ukraine. For France it was
assumed that fertility remained at the level of 1920-4. For the other countries a constant annual supply of live births was assumed, equal to those in I928 for Great Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, and Denmark, I927
for Norway and Sweden, and I929 for the Ukraine. The choice for Poland is not stated. Mortality was held constant, being derived from the following official life tables: Great Britain, the table for England and Wales, I920-2; Italy, I920-I table; the Netherlands, I9I0-20 table; Sweden, I9II-20 table; Norway, I9II-20 table; Denmark, I92I-5 table; Poland, I922 table for Posen, Poznan and Pomorze; the Ukraine, I925-6 table. The estimates for France appear to be simply an extension of Sauvy's first estimate. Migration is not taken into account in any of the estimates.
[20] " Die voraussichtliche Bev6lkerungs-
entwicklung im Deutschen Reich," Wirtschaft und Statistik, I938, pp.
97I-5, and I939, pp. 247-50.
These are two quite separate estimates,
each starting from January Ist, I938. I. The first estimate covers Germany
proper (including the Saar) and Austria. In
one graph the Sudetenland is also included, but there are no statistics for this greater coverage. As regards mortality, the German life table for I932-4 is used as the basis, but it is assumed that infant mortality will fall to 40 per I,000 live births. The fertility assumption is based on the data of I936 (marital fertility is apparently calculated according to age of mother and duration of marriage), but it is postulated that the probabiliy of marriage will further increase to such an extent that the birth deficit (evidently calculated by the Burgdorfer method) will be only 7.5 per cent instead of the 9.6 per cent shown in I936. These assumptions apply to Germany proper. For Austria (for which no separate computations are given) it is assumed that the German life table for 1932-4 will apply " very soon," and

that fertility will follow the same trend as
that in Germany since I933. Migration is
not taken into account.
2. The second estimate covers Germany proper, Austria and the Sudetenland, and
is designed to show the course of the popula-
tion if the supply of births were such as
permanently to yield an annual number of
755,ooo boys aged I9 and under 20 years. The I932-4 life table is apparently taken as
the basis, and it is postulated that infant
mortality will fall so that whereas the desired
number of youths would have required
I,649,000 live births in I938, this minimum number wil fall to I,603,000 by I953. Finally, it is assumed that the requisite annual number of live births for supplying
the contingent of 755,000 youths will be achieved as from I943. In that year live births will amount to I,630,000 and by I953 the number will fall to I,603,000 as infant mortality falls to 40 per I,000. Migration is excluded. There are no separate statistics for the component parts of the Reich. In both estimates the results are given for each sex by five-year age groups up to 60-4 years, and then in one group for all later ages. The data, which relate to the beginning of the year, are given by single-year time intervals up to I950, and then by five-year time intervals
up to 2000.

Contains a large number of extrapolations made on various bases-by fitting logistic curves, exponential curves, rates of growth, annual numbers of births and deaths-and estimates based upon various sets of assumptions as regards fertility, mortality and emigration. The estimates which are the most interesting-these are given in the attached Table I-are based on three sets of
assumptions: I. Fertility and mortality constant at the I92I level (mortality derived from the I92I life table). 2. Fertility falling at the rate shown between I92I and I928, mortality constant
at the level of the I921 life table.

3. Fertility as in 2, and mortality falling
at the rate shown by extrapolations of the various age groups, with the data
for New Zealand, I927, regarded as the ultimate goal, not yet reached (especially in infant mortality) by I96I.

For each of the above assumptions an additional calculation was made to show the effect of an annual loss of 40,000 persons by emigration (up to I93I the emigration. loss was that given by the actual data), but the mortality and fertility applied to the emigrants was apparently the same for all estimates. The results of these estimates are given by sex and in single years of age for each tenth year from I92I to I96I in the case of estimates i and 2, and for each fifth year in the case of estimate 3, the populations relating to the end of the year. Tables relating to women aged I5 to 49 years are given by single years of age and for each year of time. The results of the estimates which include the assumed emigration are given
only by broad age groups (male and females
separated) and at ten-year time intervals.

[22] Glass, D. V. -" Estimates of the future population of Italy." Some results
are cited in Population Policies and
Movements, p. 268, but the material has not otherwise been published.
There are two estimates, taking the census of I936, for Italy proper, as the starting point. The popolazione presente is used, thus excluding men in Abyssinia at the time, but this was necessary because the mortality
data given in Movimento della popolazione
are for civil mortality only. The popolazione presente for males was 20.595 millions. The Central Statistical Institute also estimated
a popolazione speciale, including men in
Abyssinia, amounting to 2I. o67 millions. (See F. Savorgnan, Atti dell'Istituto Nazionale delle Assicurazioni, I938.)
Two estimates are given:
i. Assumes the mortality of I935-7 (life
tables constructed for that period show an expectation of life at birth of 54.62 years for males and 57.39 years for females) and a constant annual supply of births at the level of the average for I935-7. An ultimately
stationary population is thus assumed. 2. Assumes the same mortality as the
first estimate, and a constant fertility at the

ESTIMATES OF FUTURE POPULATIONS OF VARIOUS COUNTRIES 8i

level of I935-7, in which period there was a gross reproduction rate of I.425 and a net reproduction rate of i.I28.
Migration is not taken into account in either estimate. Computation is by five-year age groups on the basis of survival ratios derived from the life tables, specific fertility rates being used in the second estimate to obtain the births. For the first estimate the results are given in total populations; for the second by five-year periods of age. For both estimates the results are given by fiveyear time intervals from I936 to I96I.

Ist estimate.-Assumes the maintenance of the specific fertility and specific mortality rates of I92I-5. Migration is excluded.
2nd estimate.-Assumes the approximate fertility of I926-9, and the mortality of I92I-5. As regards migration, assumes that the net loss by migration in the future in each age group will be the same proportions to the populations in the age groups as obtained in 192I-5. In the calculations, migration has been counted as mortality and a life table constructed on that basis.
3rd estimate.-Assumes constant supply

of births at 67,500 per year, apparently the average for I927-9. Mortality and migration are assumed to be at the levels chosen in the second estimate.
The results are given in totals only (males and females not separated) at ten-year time intervals from I92I to 2ooI for the first estimate, and to 20II for the second and third estimates. For the third estimate the percentage age composition is also given for I92I and 20II.

The estimate assumes the continuance (from I935) of the specific fertility rates of I930 and of the mortality shown by the I92I-30 life table. Migration is excluded. The results are given by sex and age (under i year, I-4 years, and then by five-year age groups) for the end of each year from 1931 to I945. The continuation of the estimate to I960 was made possible through unpublished data supplied by Dr. J. Backer of the Norwegian Central Statistical Office.

The estimates are based upon four sets of assumptions:
i. Extrapolation of the decline of fertility in recent years, though at a decreasing rate.
2. Assumes the marital and illegitimate fertility of I933, with the nuptiality of
I9OI-IO.
3. Assumes the same fertility as in 2, but nuptiality 25 per cent higher than in I90I-IO as from 1936.
4. Assumes nuptiality 50 per cent higher than in I9OI-IO, the marital fertility of 1933, and a regular decline in illegitimate fertility until, from I956 downwards, it is 50 per cent below the level of I933.
Migration is excluded, and all estimates assume the mortality of I933. The results
are given by five-year age groups up to 65
and then in one group for the- later ages, separately for each sex, and by five-year

time intervals (December 3ISt of the years) from I935 to i985.

Beginning from the mid-year European population for I935, three estimates are given, based on various sets of assumptions:
i. Assumes a continuance of the mortality of I934-6 (life tables constructed for that period show a mean expectation of life at birth of 58.83 years for males and 6:2.96 years for females) and the fertility of the same period. That is, the estimate assumes
a continued net reproduction rate of I .240. 2. Assumes constant mortality at the
level of I934-6, and a constant annual supply4 of births at the absolute level of the I934-6 average. An ultimately stationary population is thus assumed.
3. Assumes a decline in mortality until
I970, the fali amounting to IO per cent every
five years for the first year of life, and 7 per cent every five years for the age groups from i to 69 years. No change in mortality is assumed for the higher ages. For the fertility hypothesis, recent trends are extrapolated, the higher age groups showing a heavier decline, and the decline ceasing in I960. The assumed mean expectations of life at birth are 66.6o years for males and 69.76 years for females for I970 and subsequent years, while the assumed ultimate net reproduction rate for I970 onwards is o. 940. The estimates

ESTIMATES OF FUTURE POPULATIONS OF VARIOUS COUNTRIES 83

are computed by the application of survival
ratios derived from life tables and of the assumed specific fertility rates. Migration is excluded. For estimate (2) the results are given in total populations (males and females separately). For the other estimates the results are given by five-year age groups for the separate sexes. The results of the
first two estimates are given by five-year time intervals up to the year 2035; for the
third they are given up to the year 2000.

distribution being based on the experience of June 30th, I924, to December 3ISt, I928.
The.calculations were made by the quinquennial method (except for the ages above 65 years, where the single-year method was used) and are given in five-year age groups, separately for males and females, but for selected years only, fifteen years apart, until I978, and then for 2033. Total populations are given at five-year time intervals from
I933 to 2003.

mortality and the diagdnal decline in specific fertility rates exhibited in most countries. Fertility is assumed to remain constant from t96i, at a gross reproduction rate of o.666,
and mortality from I97I, with mean expec-
tations of life at birth of 69.45 years for males and 7I.36 years for females. The net reproduction rate from I97I onwards is thus
o.632.
Migration is excluded from all estimates.

The estimates are comtputed by the applica. tion of survival factors derived from the life tables constructed, and by applying the assumed specific fertility rates. For estimate (2) the results are given in total populations (males and females separately). The results of the other estimates are given by five-year
age groups for each sex. For all the estimates
the resultant populations are given by fiveyear time intervals up to the year 2035.
