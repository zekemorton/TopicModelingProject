NOTES AND MEMORANDA
FRANCES WOOD MEMORIAL PRIZE
THE COUNCIL OF the Royal Statistical Society offers the Frances Wood Memorial Prize of fifty guineas for competition in 1967. As its object is to encourage young investigators, competitors must be under the age of thirty-five on 1st January 1967.
The Prize is offered for the best investigation, on statistical lines, of any problem, chosen by the competitor, which bears directly or indirectly upon economic or social conditions.
This phrase may be interpreted widely and might, for example, concern housing, distribution, food production, health or nutrition, conditions of work, output, wages or expenditure, education or old age. If there exists any doubt about the suitability of a subject inquiry should be made of the Honorary Secretaries; the last three successful candidates chose for their subjects: Rehabilitation of the Tuberculous in Northern Ireland; Mortality in the London Boroughs 1950-52; Forecasting the Shipping Market.
It is suggested that the investigation should be made from material obtained by original observation or analysis carried out in the course of the competitor's ordinary work or special research. The treatment must be mainly statistical and, where material can with advantage be presented in the form of tables and diagrams, such methods should be freely used. In general the Council accepts for the competition small-scale pieces of research showing original work and personal effort seriously undertaken. Theses submitted or intended to be submitted as university exercises and for degrees and diplomas are admissible. Essays should be between 5,000 and 10,000 words. Entries must be printed or typed on foolscap or quarto paper, but diagrams may be hand-drawn.
Entries must be sent to the Honorary Secretaries of the Royal Statistical Society, 21 Bentinck Street, London, W. 1, not later than 31st December 1967.
INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH INTO MENTAL RETARDATION
THE INSTITUTE FOR Research into Mental Retardation was founded in 1966 with the aid of a grant from the National Society for Mentally Handicapped Children. The object of the Institute is to endow, promote, undertake and co-ordinate research into mental retardation, to make known the results of such research for the benefit of the public, and in furtherance of this object:
a. To keep under review the needs and strategy of research. b. To maintain a scientific library, reprints and abstract service. c. To maintain an Information Bureau on Current Research. d. To institute Conferences, Symposia, Study Groups and Seminars on any research
aspect of Mental Retardation. e. To keep under review the services provided by public and voluntary agencies for
the mentally handicapped and their families. f. To publish results of research and information obtained through any of the
activities of the Institute, and to issue an Annual Report. g. To acquire and maintain premises. h. To receive grants and acquire property in pursuance of these objects. i. To engage in such other activities as are incidental or conducive to the attainment
of the aforesaid object.
The Institute is an independent organization, and hopes to move into adequate
accommodation, which will include a seminar and conference room, as soon as possible.
