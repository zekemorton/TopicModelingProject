Inquiry into Fertility of Immigrants

Preliminary Report

Introduction
I MMIGRATION INTO BRITAIN from Com-
monwealth countries, on any appreciable scale, is a phenomenon of very recent years.
It is a result of the economic attractions of good wages and the welfare services coupled with the freedom of citizenship within the Commonwealth: a freedom now subject to qualifications as a direct result of the increasing scale of immigration. Birmingham has been a focus of attraction because of its prosperity and the
diversity of its trades. Within Birmingham immigrants have tended to congregate in certain parts of the city; Sparkbrook, Soho, Balsall Heath, Handsworth, Lozells, are all wards with more than 5,000 immigrants. Sparkbrook ward contains the highest total number of any ward, and includes representative groups from several different countries of origin. (See Table IA).
Most immigrants are not accompanied by their families when they first arrive. Some will send for them later, usually when they consider they have established themselves sufficiently securely; others may set up permanent or semi-permanent liaisons with members of the indigenous population or with other immigrants. In any case the pattern of fertility they exhibit becomes a matter both of intrinsic interest from the sociological viewpoint and of importance in the future provision of services of all kinds. Before it has crystallized into a set form in the course of time

it is important to record and examine the
pattern of fertility, even though the period is one of transition and high social mobility. It is such transitional periods in fact which have in the past so frequently escaped informed sociological observation.
The present investigation was begun in March 1963, in Sparkbrook, to attempt to provide information of this kind, and even more important, to discover to what extent such information was obtainable, and if obtainable, reliable. The Census of 1961 included questions on country

internal checks of various kinds were included. To some, however, it was impossible to get accurate answers. For example, several Indian and Pakistani families had no record of the birth dates of their children who were born before they came to this country. Their way of life at home had not demanded registration or the exact remembrance of such events. Different cultural, economic and social patterns in the immigrants' home countries made it sometimes difficult directly to compare the experiences and practices of different groups before they came to England.

The four nationality groups are close to equality in size: the optimum ratio for purposes of comparison. The third column of Table 2 shows the percentage of women ever marrying to be high, as would be expected from the method of selecting the sample, except in the West Indian group, where a different custom prevails. The column showing women ever pregnant thus gives a better basis for comparison between the groups. The figures in the last column are affected by extraneous factors in the case of the two latter groups. The marriage customs among the West Indian group are such

age, as in Table 3, the differences between the groups are revealed more clearly.
From Table 4 the average age of the English women is seen to be ten years greater than that
of women in the other groups. This difference is a reflection of the stable and long settlement pattern of the English in the area, many of whom lived and brought up their families there before the war. Immigrants tend always to be the younger, more mobile members of a community.

This, and the differences in pregnancy and marriage patterns, are all apparent from
Table 4. Table 5 clarifies the differences between
columns 2 and 3 of Table 4, revealing the never pregnant group to be a combination of young and of older women, some who have not yet begun their families, and others classifiable as infertile. In most of what follows we shall be concerned only with the fertile group.

tive throughout a nationality group. It is interesting to note the reversal in the ratio of
English to Irish in Table 8: Irish women seem

to attempt legitimization more frequently than the English. All women in the Indian/Pakistani group who conceived a child before marriage were from the Mixed group, and none of them was herself of Indian or Pakistani birth.
In the first four columns of Table 8 the comparisons between "All women" and "Women ever pregnant" are affected by the different stages reached by family units at the time of sampling: this is most obvious in the Irish group with its larger number of women not yet pregnant. The English group, despite its higher average age, has the smallest family size; allowance for age differentials might have accentuated the differences between the groups, but we discuss later our reasons for preferring direct comparisons. The difference between pregnancies and live-births, chiefly miscarriages
but a few stillbirths, is examined more closely in this and subsequent tables.
Among the Irish women in our sample fewer
pregnancies result in live births than in any other
group, a difference which is more marked when
related to mothers, as shown in the last column
of Table 8. From Table 9 it is clear that some of
the Irish women repeatedly miscarry, and that
the total of miscarriages in the Irish group is
more than double that in any other group.

Any secular changes in reproductive patterns might thereby introduce less distortion. Inspection of this Table seems to justify the hypothesis, certainly in respect of earlier childbearing.
In Table 12 we have examined the ages at
death of children up to fifteen by nationality group. Clearly these tables are biassed by the

inclusion of families in all stages of development, and in particular by differences in this respect between the groups, a fact which is demonstrated in the last column of Table 12A. The Indian/Pakistani group which showed a low rate of miscarriage shows here the highest
number of children dying. Excluding the deaths
of older children (over the age of five) there are still nearly three times the number of deaths in this group compared with the others. On closer examination in Table 12B, it is seen that their deaths are divided almost equally into the three groups of under one month, the remainder of the first year, and the subsequent four years.

ports this comparison. Neonatal mortality rates, calculated in a similar way though with still smaller numbers, are rather less divergent than rates for the whole of the first year of life. This finding, too, is consistent with expectation, because the wider divergence in rates of total infant mortality will be attributable largely to the differential effects, between groups, of malnutrition and infections in the post-neonatal period. It is open to doubt, however, whether the low miscarriage rate we found in the Indian/ Pakistani group is a true picture, or whether for
some reason it is due to under-representation.

Family Planning Information Of all the information we obtained, only a proportion of that concerning family planning represented opinion rather than fact. The first three columns of Table 13 are based on this material. The third column refers only to women potentially capable of childbirth. It is interesting to note that the English show here the lowest percentage. We based our assessment of knowledge of family planning on answers to the question "Many people do something to limit the size of their families and to control
when their children come. Do you know about family planning ?" (cf. Freedman, Whelpton and Campbell, 1959; Rowntree and Pierce, 1961).

NOTE:
1. Figures in brackets show number of families practising family planning. 2. Informants were asked also about "the pill", the douche and the ring. None of these was used at any time by any of the women.

Table 14 shows clearly the popularity of the sheath as a method of contraception and next to it, coitus interruptus. These two together account for more than half of all the methods used. There is an interesting reversal in the use of these methods between the English and Irish groups on one hand, and the West Indian and
Indian/Pakistani group on the other: coitus interruptus is more popular in the first case, and

the course of the interviewing considerable interest was shown in the use of oral contraceptives, which would probably become very popular. Many of those who found their present attempts at family limitation unsatisfactory
were anxious to find out more about these and other methods of family planning.

importance, is the structure of the interview and the personality ofthe interviewer. The interviewer must be of a patently sympathetic nature, and must establish a relationship of frankness, confidence and trust. Once achieved, the barriers are down, and taboo is no longer taboo (Norris, 1955). The subject of the latter part of the interview, present so often in the forefront of the mind of the harassed housewife and mother, is itself then an aid rather than a hindrance. Together with the information, hesitantly sought but readily proffered, on methods of family planning, it often led to an almost cathartic
outpouring. One of the important consequences of this
investigation has been to reveal the demand, and the need, for a family planning service in this district. There is every reason to hope that in the near future a clinic will in fact be set up, in the centre of the area which has been the subject of this survey. It is unlikely that Sparkbrook is exceptional in this respect, so that we may infer that the need exists in many similar areas of immigrant settlement. Our experience suggests that given suitable initial publicity family planning centres set up in such areas would be readily accepted and well patronized.
Acknowledgements We should like to acknowledge with gratitude
a grant received through the agency of Dr. G. C. L. Bertram. Many people have given us both help and encouragement in all the stages of this Inquiry, and to all of them we should like to express our thanks. In particular we are grateful to Professor P. Sargant Florence, Professor F. Lafitte and Dr. D. E. C. Eversley for their constant interest, to Mrs. Valerie Jackson of the West Midlands Social & Political Research Unit for analyzing the Census data referring to Sparkbrook, and to Dr. F. S. Hashmi who, with the permission of Professor W. H. Trethowan, helped as an interpreter in interviewing among those Indian and Pakistani families having little English, and generally in elucidating many

aspects of their home environment. Finally we are indebted to all those families whom we interviewed for their ready co-operation and friendly response.
