that of lower orders by a comprehensive system of untouchability.
The group life of the Nayars is largely determined by two important institutionsfirst, the system of inheritance known as Marumakkathayam, and secondly, the " Sambandham " form of marriage. According to the former, descent and inheritance are reckoned in the female line and kinship is traced from a common ancestress. More concretely, a man's heirs are his sister's children, his own wife and offspring having no legal claim to his family estate. The wife lives in her mother's house where she is visited by her husband, generally at night. The peculiar features of " Sambhandam" are the absence of ceremonies and the lack of religious sanctions. The union, which is based upon mutual consent, is effected by the presentation of a cloth by the bridegroom to the bride. Divorce and widow-remarriage are permitted to both parties, and conjugal freedom being not all on one side the relation of the sexes appears to be more rational than among most other communities.
At the bottom of the society are castes and tribes mainly or purely Dravidian in origin and shut off from contact with higher orders by an infinite variety of social barriers. They include whole groups of artisans, fishermen, boatmen and agricultural serfs and hillsmen, and in the main follow the matriarchal system in the south of the state and the patriarchal in the north.
METHOD OF INVESTIGATION
The investigation was carried out during the months of January to May of I937 and was based upon the principle of random sampling. The 280 villages and towns in the State were arranged in alphabetical order and every fifth unit was chosen for study. Within each selected unit again, every fifteenth house, according to the serial arrangement adopted at the I93I census, was chosen. We had thus a sample of nearly 3,ooo houses. To elicit the requisite information a questionnaire-a copy of which is given in the appendix-was circulated among

the households selected for study, and to
ensure correct returns and to clear up mis-
apprehensions regarding the object of our
enquiry visits were paid to all the places concerned. The questionnaire was drawn up on the simplest lines, our aim being to secure
correct information on a few important issues rather than vague and unreliable data on a
large number of points. Moreover, the questions had to be so framed as to minimize the possibility of ambiguous answers being given. Finally, we had to steer clear of all queries that might hurt the sensibilities of the people. We may at this stage state that the response received from them was satis-

Our sample included 4,I70 women in the ages of I5 to 45. We had from our knowledge of customs prevalent among the Cochin population adopted I5 as the lower limit of the reproductive age period for women. Fortunately, the data collected by us amply support this choice. Of the women who bore, children in the year I936-7 virtually none were less than I5 years in age. The upper limit is also fairly well indicated by the age 45; only a very small percentage of the women in our sample who gave birth to children in the year in question belonged to ages 45 and above.
The women in this broad age division are first arranged in annual age periods. The crude material when thus arranged show all the biases and imperfections which are familiar to students of Indian population problems. To remove these defects we have rearranged the original data into alternate

children. This total is somewhat greater than the corresponding figure for the Ukraine population, in I926-7 the difference being
due almost wholly to the larger contribution made by Cochin women in ages I5-I9 com-
pared to that of Ukraine women at the same
ages. " Total fertility includes births both of
boys and girls. For studies of the trend of
fertility it is advisable to restrict the in-
vestigation to the birth of females, the potential future mothers." This is done in the gross reproduction rate, which is simply the total fertility divided by the sex ratio of children at birth. In our investigation we could not secure sufficiently reliable data regarding the sex ratio at birth of Cochin
children. We have, therefore, to employ a rather devious method to secure the ratio. The I93I Census Report of Cochin gives the sex
ratio of the first-born children in the State. But the report of the Census of Travancorean adjoining state and in many respects similar to Cochin-for the same year, gives us data of sex ratio at birth for the first born as well as for subsequently born children. On the assumption that the sex ratio of the first born influences the sex ratio for all
births we have made use of the proportion between the sex ratio of the first and subsequently born children in Travancore to
calculate the sex ratio for all births in Cochin. On our assumption this ratio turns out to be I,052 male births per every I,000 female births. The gross reproduction rates

of Cochin is thus 5 27 x I,000 or 2 56. This 2,052
is somewhat higher than the corresponding
rate of 2-49 for Ukraine in i926-7.
NET REPRODUCTION RATE
The gross reproduction rate is, however, an imperfect index of population change since it ignores the influence of mortality conditions. This influence is taken into account by the net reproduction rate which is calculated for Cochin population in the Table III.
As Cochin has no life table of its own we have made use of the life table of Travancore population in I93I. From column 4 (a) of Table III it appears that i,ooo girls born in Cochin in I936-7 would, on the assumptions made, give birth to 3,700 children, in the course of their lives. Of these children
3,700 X I,OO i.e. I,8oo, would be girls.
The net reproduction rate for Cochin in I936-7 is, therefore, I - 8o, which implies that the population of Cochin tends, in present circumstances, to increase by four-fifths every generation.
RATES IN COCHIN AND UKRAINE COMPARED
The Cochin rate may now be compared with the Ukranian. In I926-7 the Ukranian net reproduction rate was i *68. A part-but probably a negligible part-of the difference between the two rates might have been caused by the difference between the sex

ratios at birth of the two populations. But in the main it seems to be due to the more favourable mortality conditions that prevail among Cochin females in the reproduc-
tive ages. This is shown by the fact that when the specific fertility rates of Cochin

women are applied to the Ukranian population, the net reproduction rate is reduced to I 70, which is slightly greater than the net reproduction rate of the Ukranian popula-
tion itself.
