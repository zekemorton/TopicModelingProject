by costermongers and hawkers. As it is claimed that occupation (males
only, at ages I6-65) gives the surest guide to wealth, culture, and status, in a general way, social .gradation on an occupational basis is adopted for the comparison of mortality. Every occupation distinguished in the census is assigned to one of five grades. They are: I, Upper (Professional, etc.); 2, Intermediate (between i and 3); 3, Skilled Workmen; 4, Intermediate; and 5, Unskilled Labourers. Grades i, 3, and 5 are clearly defined, doubtful cases being put in

is somewhat rough-and-ready and empirical, Dr. Stevenson says in evidence of its funda-

The reader of this paper (and, indeed, of the Decennial Supplement also) is left to infer that different mortality rates are
almost solely determined by the different
environmental influences associated with, and corresponding to, the different occupa-
tions, and the groups into which they are gathered. But it seems to the present writer that the most essential factor, in the partial success of the classification, goes unrecognised. It is the underlying cause which has determined in the past, and which determines to-day, the actual personnel of the different occupations and social grades, that is of paramount importance. This cause is natural endowment-natural inheritance. And the reason why the five grades appear to have been built up upon the true lines is really because certain types of occupation, and certain degrees of wealth and culture, go generally (not always) hand-in-hand with corresponding degrees of natural endowment: Occupational grading, in fact, corresponds roughly with a grading in accordance with natural gifts. Consequently it happens that the higher grades contain (relatively to their total numbers) a much greater proportion of individuals of good inheritance, than do the lower. But every

Again, the exceedingly high mortality rates (see table) for dock labourers and
hawkers can only be accounted for as being
in great part owing to their defective natural inheritance. Their occupational environ-
ment is not usually bad; much of their work
is in the open air. But their remuneration is poor, their employment uncertain, and it is
common knowledge that for these reasons
their ranks are chiefly recruited from the constitutional derelicts of the large towns-
improvidents, idlers, degenerates, ' unfits.' The same remarks apply to another large group, general undefined labourers. Here again we observe how the occupation selects the type, and how closely mortality corresponds to natural inheritance.

CHILD MORTALITY A careful study of the official volumes*
relating to the health of our nation leaves one with a feeling of disappointment and oppression.
As evidence of achievement we are told to observe the vital statistics of to-day, and compare them with those of the past. Attention is drawn to the fall in the general death-rate, and especially to the fall in infant mortality and in the death-rates of young children. We are informed that these figures speak for themselves of a better state of things. But do they? And are we to accept them, without question, as proof of a satisfactory bill of health ?

It is apparent from this table that as age increases mortality rates tend towards equality for all. This is clear evidence of the mixed character of each grade (and occupation) from the point of view of inheritance. In each, those of good endowment struggle successfully through the adversities of their respective environments, and tend to reach a very similar old age. But the constitutional weaklings, being far

Accordingly, with infants, in particular, and with very young children, at different periods and under widely-different conditions, a falling death-rate may be altogether deceptive as indicative of an improvement in inherent healthfulness, since the life of a most wretchedly-endowed or even mortallyafflicted infant can be amazingly prolonged by a sedulous system of nursing and dietary.

NATURAL AND SOCIAL SELECTION

For instance, during I926 (the year especially under review) our general deathrate was ii.6 per thousand persons-the lowest yet recorded; and Sir George New-
man (Chief Medical Officer, Ministry of Health), in his yearly report, makes the statement that " the expectation of life for a child born in this country to-day is not less than seventeen years longer than it was for a child born in i846." The following table shows the decline in mortality which has actually taken place of late in each
year up to five:

There were also 53,220 deaths from cancer during I926. In other words, of every i,ooo deaths from all causes, I17 were from cancer. The steady increase in mortality from this disease in recent times is exhibited in the following table, which shows the actual deaths per million of population at various periods:

The number of infants and young children, therefore, who are being saved to-day -at any rate for a while-is evident. But what is the nature of many of these children saved? In the majority of cases are they of the best stocks, or of the worst? The answer in view of the existing differential death and birth-rates is unfortunately only too obvious. They are, for the most part, physical and mental defectives who, under

perhaps nearer 2 per cent. of the general population." This would amount to considerably more than half a million individuals. In addition, however, to this vast figure he thinks that there is an even greater number of border-line cases (uncertifiable), epileptics, neurasthenics, and the like.
There is every reason to believe that all these conditions are becoming more and more widely disseminated by intermarriage. Dr. Tredgold further says: " An overwhelming proportion of cases of mental dis-
ease must be regarded as primarily due to innate and not to external causes." He estimates that about four-fifths of all cases of mental deficiency are hereditary in origin.
The death-roll from influenza has risen rapidly. The following table, in decennial

The sharp rise in I926-27 was, of course,
due to industrial troubles. But the following remark of the Minister of Health is well worth bearing in mind, " It is not generally realised that during the past six years numbers of young men, without employment and
maintained on Poor Law relief, have married, securing thereby an increase in their income from relief, and have had families, each addition to the family bringing its addition to the family income."
It must furthermore be remembered that huge and increasing sums are being paid out

The fluctuation is peculiar, but reveals that
the percentage of children requiring treatment instead of declining after entering school, seems rather to increase, despite a death-rate in some degree selective.
Of the entrants, 46 per cent. suffer from dental decay, I5 per cent. have severe caries,
with septic gums. It is stated in the Report
that " these figures show no diminution."
Of the first three groups 5.5 per cent. were referred for treatment for tonsils and
adenoids; 5.2 per cent. for enlarged glands in the neck-an increase of recent years (says the Report).
Of 8-year-old children no less than 5I.9
per cent. of the boys, and 54.7 per cent. of the girls failed to pass the test for normal
vision.
Besides cases requiring treatment, many
thousand others are marked as " requiring observation." Also, multitudes of instances of heart, lung, and nervous defects, as well as all kinds of deformities were brought to light during these routine inspections at the
ordinary elementary schools. But, it must be remembered, in estimating
the total amount of unfitness in children, that there are now many special places for the reception of the more defective, schools for the blind and the partially blind, for the deaf and hard-of-hearing; open-air schools and camps; schools for the mentally defective; epileptic colonies; and so forth. Furthermore, there exist a certain number who are altogether unfit for any kind of
school.
In an article in the English Review
(March, I927) Mr. Ludovici brought forward official statistics which demonstrated
that, although general cleanliness and clothing had improved in school children, yet in recent years the percentage of Ai individuals (both boys and girls) was definitely declining, also that sickness (especially rheumatic and heart trouble, chorea and nervous disorders) had increased following the decline in infant mortality.
"The school medical service," says the London school medical officer (Dr. Menzies), " is a receiver of damaged goods and spends most of its time and energies in patching them up." But he appears to think that

104 THE EUGENICS REVIEW

the ' damage ' takes place between birth and the age of going to school. Then why has the ' damage ' increased during the years when pre-school care has improved?
THE INVISIBLE COST
That the cost of unfitness is each year rapidly increasing is evidenced on every hand. But the total amount cannot be precisely estimated, since some of it is borne by local authorities, some by State grants, and much again by voluntary aid. Besides actual expenditure, other factors have to be considered. Not only do the unfit require

maintenance, but they are inefficient aJ unproductive-a dead loss to the State i every way.

This is true alike of paii State-officials, voluntary philanthropi workers, and relatives of ' unfits ' in t home circle. Were it not for the existenc of so many ' unproductives,' more fi individuals would unquestionably be born every year.
