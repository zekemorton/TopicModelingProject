-I33,000 more than in I935-then after
seven years register a decline in numbers by I5 per cent., after seventeen years by 26 per cent., and after twenty-seven years, that is by I965, by 30 per cent. (Boys in
the preparatory school ages, 8-I2, are already fewer and anticipations of the future warn us to expect their numbers to fall even more rapidly. The I,754,I53 enumerated
in the census of I93I may be reduced by 1945 to I,353,000 and by I965 to I,172,000.)
The situation would be even worse, on the
other hand, if instead of remaining constant at its value in I933 the birth-rate continued
to fall (see Table IB). By the year I965, both boys and girls from ii to i8, and boys in the
public school ages, I3-I8, might then have
been reduced to less than half their numbers to-day, while the group of boys between 8 and I2 might fall to almost one-third of its size in 192I. Even if the birth-rate were to maintain its recent slight recovery, moreover, and stabi-
lize itself rather above its value in I933, the resulting births would still be far below what is necessary to maintain the school population undiminished, and any decline in numbers would only be postponed, not
eliminated.

Enrolments in Secondary Schools
Clearly, then, enrolments in schools for younger children must grow progressively smaller. But how will numbers in the secondary schools be affected as the totals of all adolescents are gradually decimated? Will these latter reductions be directly reflected in secondary school enrolments? Many anticipate that the effect of the falling birth-rate in these schools will be more than neutralized by the operation of other factors, particularly by the growing public appreciation of the value of a secondary education and by the determination of an everincreasing number of parents to secure its benefits for their children-a determination which frequently involves limiting the size of families very strictly, and consequently aggravating the population problem as a whole. Undoubtedly this argument should bear some weight. The proportion of children going to a secondary school is already higher than it was even ten years ago, and it is very likely to increase still further. Any such change, however, is most unlikely to be drastic enough to offset the falling numbers which must be expected in the reservoir

from which scholars might be drawn. Again, therefore, the decline in numbers could only be postponed at best, and not eliminated.
Council and Self-Governing Secondary Schools
Since it is thus evident that the total of pupils in all secondary schools will grow progressively smaller, the question arises whether the major losses must be borne by the council secondary schools (i.e. the schools financed and controlled by local education

parents will be able to afford and will in fact plan non-state education for their children.
In estimating what weight should be given to such arguments, the record of the last two decades, during which families have been
.gowing progressively smaller and during
which, if these arguments are justified, the independent schools should have been attracting an increasing proportion of iecondary school attendants, must be held as important evidence. And what do these records reveal ? They reveal that while the
Iecondary school population as a whole has prown rapidly, the great bulk of gains have
been made, not by the independent, but by ,Uie council secondary schools. Before the War, 36 8 per cent. of all boys in secondary chools (including here all public schools and,
On addition, all other establishments which

The decrease in public boarding ools from I9 .3 per cent. to IO * 9 per cent. as even greater than that in public day ools, the latter being from I4*8 per cent. ii *6 per cent. The other self-governing ools also suffered some loss although uch lighter than the public schools. In I9I3 e former contributed 29-2 per cent. to the tal, at the later date 25-9 per cent. Boys public boarding schools were actually er in absolute numbers in 1933-4 than I9I9-20, and public day schools had creased by no more than 4,07I* a striking trast to the council secondary schools ere an addition of 70,IOI boys nearly ubled this population (see Table II).

secondary schools attended those controlled by councils, but by I935-36 this figure had swollen to almost 6o per cent., whereas the independent schools' pre-War share of well
over a half of the total is rapidly shrinking to a third. These recognized independent schools for girls have added no more than a mere 8oo to their numbers in sixteen post-War years, while the girls' population in council schools, like the boys', has nearly doubled itself by an increase of some 72,450 during this period (see Table III). The whole gain has unquestionably been made by the state council schools. The experience of twenty years in fact lends no support whatever to the theory that smaller families will come to the rescue of the self-governing schools and allow them once more to take a larger proportion of all secondary school pupils. (The non-recognized private schools have been excluded from these considerations, but there is no doubt whatever that if the facts were known, they have suffered incomparably greater losses even than recognized schools. Their inclusion would only add greater weight to the argument.)
Non-grant Independent Schools for Girls
But if the girls' independent schools on the efficient list have, as a body, barely avoided actual losses in their numbers, what have been the fortunes of the different establishments which compose this group ? Such an analysis shows that whereas on the one hand numbers have fallen in the schools assisted by grants from public funds while still retaining complete independence in government, on the other hand, the population in the non-grant schools has risen from 8,7I8 in I9I3-I4 to I4,464 after the War and to 34,578 by I935-36 (see Table IV). How does it come about that these non-grant schools can claim a post-War increase of some 20,000, which, although small compared with the council schools' 72,500, must be counted as substantial? Without any question, the reason must be sought in the steady influx from the vast numbers of non-recognized schools for girls. As the standard required of a girl's education has gradually been raised, parents have become less willing to entrust that

38 THE EUGENICS REVIEW

education to the poor type of small private
school; schools inspected by the Board of
Education and found efficient seem increasingly attractive. Consequently, not only have well-established schools grown larger and others of this type been opened, but in addition many private schools have qualified for recognition in order to ensure their own
survival. This latter tendency is particularly reflected in the increase from I5 before the War to 92 in I935-36 of the recognized nongrant schools solely the responsibility of proprietors. (The total of non-grant schools
on the efficient list increased from 62 in I9I3-I4 to 244 twenty-two years later.) A growing appreciation of schools of the first
rank has resulted in schools controlled by foundations accounting for 44*5 per cent. of
