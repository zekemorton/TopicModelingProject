THE EUGENICS REVIEW

Results The gonorrhoea rate varied widely between Districts. In Teso District the rate was much higher than anywhere else, but the Mubende and Bugisu rates were also high. Bunyoro had a high rate and so did Mengo and Lango. In general, the Districts of low fertility are those which have been mentioned, with the exception that Bugisu
has a high fertility rate. Ankole and Kigezi Districts in particular, have the highest of the reliable fertility rates, and these Districts have low rates for gonorrhoea and stricture. As far as stricture rates are concerned, Mengo, Masaka, and Bunyoro dominated.
From Figures 1 and 2 it can be seen that reasonably good inverse correlations were obtained. The correlation coefficient for the gonorrhoea/fertility relation was 0.64 (p = <0-01), and that between stricture and fertility was 0.59 (p between 0.05 and 0.01).

DISCUSSION
The findings strongly suggest that in Uganda fertility is largely determined by the frequency of gonorrhoea. This idea is not new. It was advanced tentatively by Lorimer in 1954,6 but no evidence other than hearsay was adduced in support. Indeed, in 1952, Richards and Reining2 doubted whether venereal disease was responsible for the low fertility in Buganda and around Bukoba. In view of the known concern of the Buganda about their fertility, it is surprising that the connection with gonorrhoea has not been previously investigated.
Although urethral stricture in men does not bear the same causal relation to sterility as gonorrhoea, it correlates with the fertility rate

fertility rates for each District and significant inverse correlations obtained.
3. It is concluded that gonorrhoea is one of the major determinants of fertility in Uganda.
4. Confirmatory evidence for this view is discussed. 5. It is likely that in some areas of Uganda one-half of the women have been sterilized by gonorrhoea by the age of thirty.
