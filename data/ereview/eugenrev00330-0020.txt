THE RACIAL EFFECT OF ALCOHOL'

By RAYMOND PEARL.

During the past fifteen years more extensive and penetrating investigations have been carried out regarding the effect upon the descendants in the kinship nexus, of the use of alcohol by the ascendants, than in the entire prior history of the subject. These investigations have been in the main experimental, though a few extremely important ones have been statistical. It is the thorough application of the experimental method to the problem however, which has markedly, and it appears securely, advanced our knowledge in this field. To get really critical, accurate and extensive
-statistics about any phase of the alcohol question from human beings is an extremely difficult task, in my experience.2 It can only be done, I think, by enlisting the services of highly trained field workers, who by visiting families, are able finally to establish such relations of friendliness, or even intimacy, as make possible frank and true statements about such a delicate question (in America, at least) as alcoholic habits. This is an expensive process, in time and
money.
In a laboratory experiment, on the other hand, not only are there no social or ethical elements to embarrass the research, but there is the opportunity of virtually complete control of the whole life of the individual. It is possible in this way to get a kind of -evidence on the problem which can be had in no other way.
In view of the progress which bas been made it seems desirable
at this time to make a brief review of the whole matter. An especial reason for such a review just now is that during the past two or three years there has come about a clear agreement between certain extensive pieces of research on the subject which were formerly thought by many to be in fundamental contradiction. In this review I shall not attempt, for reasons of space, to list all the papers eon the subject. I shall discuss and refer only to the more important. But from these any one can easily pick up the bibliographical citations of practically all that has appeared.
The present era of the critical investigation of the problem of the racial effect of alcohol may be properly said to begin, I think, with

the work of Pearson.3 The chief results of the first of these studies which is the one directly and pertinently bearing upon our present problem were
"There is a hiaher death rate among the offspring of alcoholic than among the offspring of sober parents. This appears to be more marked in tliecase of the mother than in the case of the fatlmer, and since it is sen.siblv higber in the case of the mother who has drinikimig bouts than of the nmotlher i%ho habitually drinks, it wotild appear to be due very considterably to acei(dents amid gross carelessness and possibly in a minor diegree to a toxic effect on the offsprilng.
"Owinga to the greater fertility of alcoholic parents, the nett fainily of the sober is hardly larger thami the nett famnily of the alcoholic.
"The mean weight and height of the children of alcoholic parents are sliahtly greater than those of sober parents,but as the age of the former children is slightly greater, the correlations when corrected for age are slightly positive, i.e., there is slightly greater height and weight in the children of the sober. In the case of the father the correlations are niot significanit havinlg regar(d to their probable error; in the case of the mother they may be just signlificant but they are so slight as to have no importance.
" The general health of the children of alcoholic parents appears on the whole slightly better than the health of the children of sober pareints. There are fewer delicate children and in a most marked way cases of tuberculosis an(l epilepsy are less fre(uent than among the children of sober parenits. The soturce of this relation may be sought in two directions; the physically strongest in the community have probably the greatest capacity and taste for alcolhol. Further the higher death rate of the children of alcoholic parents probably leaves the fitter to survive.
" Parenital alcoholism is not the source of mental defect in offspring. " The relationship, if any, between parental alcoholism and filial inltelligence is so slight, that even its sign cannot be determined from the present material. " The normal visioned and normal refractioned offspring appear to be in rather a preponderance in the families of the drinking parents, the parenits who have "bouts" give iiitermediate results, but there is no substanitial relationslhip between goodness of sight and parental alcoholism. " The frequency of diseases of the eye andl eyelids, which might well be attributedl to parental neglect, was found to have little, if any rclation to parenltal alcoholism. "To sum up then, no marked relation has been found between the intelligence, physique or disease of the offspring and parental alcoholism in aniy of the categories investigated. On the whole the balance turns as often in favour
of the alcoholic as of the non-alcoholic parentage." It will be noted that there is here made for the first time the
definife suggestion that alcoholism in the parents miiay have a selective effect upon the offspring. The evidence for the conclusion is statistical in character, and consists of two points: (a) greater death rate among children of alcoholics, and (b) superiority of surviving children. There was no suggestion made of selection of germ cells in the gonads of drinking parents.
The most extensive experimental study of the problem is that

of Stockard.4 Earlier experimental work, such for example as that of Laitinen, and a number of others, had been. felt to be open to
rather obvious criticism, in one respect or another. Some had used
obviously faulty methods ; others had not kept, or at any rate published, detailed records of just what was done or happened; others had failed to follow the matter far enough to justify any conclusions. All told, experimental work preceding Stockard's attack on the problem produced little effect on the mind of the scientific public.
Stockard's work with alcohol began in 1909, and was not at first genetic in character, but embryological. He instituted experiments on the modification of the development of fish embryos, which have their embryonic life outside the body of the mother. He has recently5 (loc cit. (B) p. 255) interpreted the results of this experiment in the following words :-
"When eggs were placed in water containing from 1 to 5 per cent. of ethyl alcohol their rate of development was considerably inhibited andl in thestronger solutions almost stopped. On later returning these eggs to the usual sea-water environment development was resumed at a normal or almost no?mal rate. Nevertheless, the arrests which had been experienced cauised in many
of the eggs the entire suppression of develorment, while in others the development of many organs and parts were greatly modified . The embryos develop ed abnormally and were monstrous in form.
" Anl im)ortant fact to be noted is the great individual variation in the way the eggs react to the solutions. When anv lot of one hundred eggs are examined after these treatments it will be found that a certain Ferceit. ge of them are developing perfectly normally, as if these had entirely resistd the effects of the treatmenit; others are only slightly affected; others exhibit more marked modifications; and a number of the eggs have actually been killed. It is thus seen that the effect of the treatment varies with the hardiness of the
egg. The poor eggs which would have, under usual conditions, develored
into weak embryos are eliminated by the treatment, those of low average resistance are injured, while the particularly fine eggs are apparently not affecte(l and live to hatch as vigorots young fish. This variable response occuirs when eggs are treated with a sublethal dose of any chemical substance, and it is in no sense a peculiar reaction to alcohol.
" Another fact that should be fully recognized in drawing general conclusions from the responses of these embryos to alcohol is that exactly the same injuiries and developmental deformities are readily induced by the use of a great iiumber of other chemical stuffs, and also by unusual physical con(litions. The fact that such deformities are experimentally produced in embryos by

others, and fuirthermore they are themselves excellent summaries of the whole work . (A) Stockard, C. R. andI Papanicolaou, G. N. Further studies on the modification of the germ-cells in mammals; the effect of alcohol on treated guinea pigs and their descendants. Jour. Exper. Zool. Vol. 26, pp.-

accounts of this work Stockardl did not lay the stress that he now does on the selec-
tive character of the results taken as a whole. The significance of this point will appear as we proceed.

12 EUGENICS REVIEW.
the application of alcohol does not in any sense demonstrate that human deformities have been induced by a similar cause. The amount of alcohol in the solutions to which the eggs are subjected is greater than could be tolerated in the human blood stream. It is also a fact that common salt (sodium chloride), sugar, and many other constanitly used substances in human food are
equally as effective in inducing the same types of developmental modifications
in these eggs as is the application of alcohol. The fact that an experimenter may use an effective dose of a certain substance to induce developmental disturbai.ces has no direct bearing on the question of the use of this substance ifn very much smaller amounts by man or other animals.
" These results should be conisidered in an impartial manner and should not be distorted for one purpose or another in a discussion of the use of alcohol by man. I can only say, as ani em ryologist, that the experiments give no certain proof that alcohol has ever caused abnormal development in the human embryo. Neither do they prove that it may not, except in so far as the doses here necessary to induce an effect are greater than we have reason to believe ever exist in the human body."
Following this work on externally developing enmbryos Stockard began the series of experiments on guinea pigs which has received such wide and deserved recognition. The initial purpose was to see whether in internally developing embryos results similar to those on fish eggs could be got. Alcohol was administered to guinea pigs in the form of vapor inhalation. This was a great advance in the experimental technique of the subject because it avoided the secondary disturbances of general metabolism which follow daily administration of alcohol in solution per os continued over long periods of time. It is the general experience of all students of the problem that animals receiving alcohol by inhalation remain in excellent general health over long periods of time, and in fact usually attain to greater total duration of life than control animals not given alcohol. (cf. Pearl loc. cit. supra.).
The general broad result of Stockard's studies, and essentially the only one in any way emphasized, or even recognisably pointed out, in his papers over roughly the first ten years of'the work was that the administration of alcohol to the parents caused the production of a not large but still perfectly definite and significant number
of defective offspring, many of which were non-viable for more than a short time, and some of which lived as monstrous forms. This aspect of Stockard's results has recently been illustrated by him i
a table (loc. cit. (B) p. 255) which may be reproduced here as the briefest way of stating the facts.
This table needs no particular comment. It demonstrates the main conclusion of all of Stockard's reports on this work prior to 1922. He has supported and developed it by a great variety of ingenious and painstaking experiments.

domestic fowl as material. My object was two-fold. Primarily I was interested in seeing whether administrating various volatile chemical substances over long periods of time by inhalation it would be
possible to induce specific and permanent changes in the genetic constitution of the germ cells-to induce and experimentally control new heritable variations, in short. This I then regarded, and still look upon, as the most fundamental problem of organic evolution. In the second place Stockard agreed in conference that it was highlydesirable to repeat his experiments with a different animal than the guinea pig, to see if the same results would be obtained. The methods
used were in all essentials the same as those of Stockard. Like him I started with a number of different substances, but presently came to the use only of ethyl alcohol. The investigation went on without interruption, and on a rather extensive scale, till the spring of 1917. A large amount of unpublished material had accumulated. My entrance upon war service in June, 1917, necessarily ended the experiments, but only for the time being it was then expected. When in March, 1919, I was able to resume academic life, two developments of the work were contemplated. One was to publish as soon as possible all the mass of material which had accumulated in the experiments with alcoholized fowls and their progeny. The other was to continue the experiments with mice, and with all the refinements of method which had suggested themselves in the course of the earlier work. To this end a colony of mice of great genetic purity and
homogeneity had been bred up by my assistant, Miss Sylvia L.
Parker, during 1918 and 1919. Both of these projects received a
summary quietus on November 24th, 1919, when my laboratory was ermpletely destroyed by fire. Neither records nor animals could be saved.

This first year's work showed that out of 12 different characters for which there were quantitative data, the offspring of treated parents taken as a group were superior to the offspring of untreated parents in eight characters.
These results were first presented in a paper read before the American Philosophical Society on April 15th, 1916 (Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc. Vol. 55, pp. 243-258, 1916). It was suggested that these
results, as well as the results of earlier workers, might be most satisfactorily accounted for on the hypothesis that alcohol and similar substances act as selective agents upon the germ cells of treated animals. The essential points in the hypothesis were put in the following way.
(a). Assume that the relative vigor, or resisting power of germ cells varies, or grades continuously from a low degree to a high degree, and further assume that the absolute vigor of the whole
population of germ cells measured by the mean, is different for different species.
(b). In the intensity of dosage employed in inhalation experi-

THE RACIAL EFFECT OF ALCOHOL.

15

ments alcohol does not destroy or functionally inactivate all germ

cells but does so destroy or inactivate some of them. The proportion-

ate number of the whole population of germ cells which will be

inactivated by such dosage may fairly be supposed to depend upon

the mean absolute vigor or resisting power characteristic of the

particular species or strain used. In a species with germ cells of

absolutely low mean vigor proportionately more will be functionally inactivated than in a species of high absolute mean vigor of germ

cells.

(c). Besides the germ cells which are wholly inactivated by the

agent, and which we may designate as class (a), we rnay fairly

assume that there is a possibility of two other classes existing, viz., (b) germ cells which, while not completely inactivated, are so injured

by the agent as to produce zygotes which are measurably defective

in some degree, and (c) germ cells wihich are not measurably affected

by the agent at all in the dosage employed, and produce zygotes

which are not discernibly otherwise than perfectly normal.

(d). It appears entirely fair to assume that germ cells of the

(a) class are of relatively the lowest mean vigor or resisting power,

class (b) next, and class (c) the highest. The proportionate number

of the two sorts of zygotes corresponding to classes (b) and (c) of

germ cells which would be expected to appear in any experiments

made to test the point would clearly be a function of the mutual

relationship or proportionality between two variables, the dosage of thje deleterious agent on the one hand, and the mean absolute

resisting power of the germ cells characteristic of the strain or species

of animal used in the experiments on the other hand.

(e). If the dosage of the agent be relatively high in proportion

to the mean absolute resisting power it would be expected that all the

germ cells would fall into classes (a) and (b), producing no zygotes

at all or zygotes in some degree defective.

(I). If, on the other hand, the dosage, though absolutely the same, be relatively lower in proportion to the mean absolute resisting

power of the germ cells it would be expected that all three germ cell classes (a), (b) and (c) would be represented. The zygotes actually formed would be chiefly produced by (c) germ cells, and to a much smaller extent by (b) cells. Under these circum.stances it would

necessarily follow that a random sample of the zygotes produced

after the action of the deleterious agent would, on the average, be

superior in respect to such qualities as growth, etc., which may be

supposed to depend in part at least upon germinal vigor, to a random

sample of zygotes formed before the action of the agent, because the

germ cells of class (c) are a selected superior portion of the total

gametic population.

(g). Essentially that proportionality between effective dosage

of the deleterious agent and absolute resisting power of the germ

cells outlined in obtained in my

the preceding paragraph experiments with fowls,

This Table brings out the following points
(a). Considering the totals, and comparing chicks with any alcoholic ancestry, as a group, with chicks having no alcoholic ancestry as a group, it is clear that there were fewer of the formier than of the latter from a given number of eggs. In every 100 eggs from birds in the alcoholic series approxinmately 58 zygotes (embryos) were formed as against 80 in every 100 eggs in the non-alco-holic series.
(b). The total number of offspring zygotes dealt with in the experiments (1628) is respectable, and sucb as to lead to reasonable confidence in the results, especially in view of the fact that these results were in every essential particular in full accord as to their
sense with those obtained in the 1915 experiments, and even more
pronounced in degree. (c). The prenatal mortality was approximately 10%, and the
postnatal mortality (to 180 days of age) was approximately 5%
lower in the chicks with alcoholic ancestry than in those of nonalcoholic ancestry.
(d). While from a given number of eggs 26S81% fewer zygotes
were formed in the alcoholic series than in the non-alcoholic, 10.7% more of these zygotes were alive when adult age (180 days) was reached if their ancestry was alcoholic than if it were non-alcoholic.
(e). The great reduction in zygote formation (partial sterility) observed in the alcohol treated series appeared to be preponderantly due to the effect of the alcohol upon the germ cells of the female.

THE RACIAL EFFECT OF ALCOHOL.

17

While there was some diminution in the effective fecundity of the male
as a result of the treatment, it was much smaller than in the female. In the first two lines of the Table, where the dam was alcoholic, we have 22 and 8% of the eggs forming enmbryos, as against values of from 54 to 68% where the sire was alcoholic and the dam not. The lower
value for the percentage of zygote formation in the case of matings where the dam was alcoholc as compared with those in which both 'parents were alcoholic, almost certainly does not represent a significant difference, but was an accidental result of the small number of inatings in the class. The significant thing is the fact that the percentage of zygote formation steadily rises as we compare the following groups: (1) dam alone or dam and sire alcoholic, (2) sire alone or sire and some other ancestry not including dani alcoholic,
(8) no ancestry alcoholic. These results clearly indicated that the germinal selective action
of the alcohol postulated in my earlier papers was continuing to work, so far at least as the basic biological character viability (duration of life, mortality) was concerned. There was a mass of other evidence to this effect in the records which did not get published before they were burned, as described above.
I did show, however, that there was no sensibly higher proportion
of abnormalities of development amiong the zygrotes of alcoholic
ancestry than among those of non-alcoholic ancestry. This is demonstrated in Table IV.

My results so far had been such as to indicate that alcohol did act as a selective agent upon the germ cells, and I had therefore laid stress upon this aspect of its action in interpre-ting the results. But 1 fully recognised that'it might act similarly as a selective agent upon the developing zygotes. In the summer of 1916, in fact, I carried out the first experiment of which there is record, so far as I know,
specifically and solely directed to the testing of the question as to

as a selective agent upon developing zygotes 681-682). The experiment was as follows:

Two incubators were used, each containing at the outstart 890

eggs. These eggs were selected with the utmost care to ensure like-

ness of age, of strain, and of other characteristics in the two lots.

In one incubator 40 cc. of 95% ethyl alcohol were evaporated beneath

the eggs daily. In the other incubator no alcohol was used. At the

end of 7 days 180 eggs, designated as Lot 1, were removed from the

alcohol incubator and allowed to complete their development in a

normal non-alcoholic incubator. At the end of fourteen days the

remaining contained

eggs
130

(after testing out infertiles) of eggs, were removed from the

Lot 2, which originally
alcohol incubator and

finished their development without further dosage of alcohol in a

normal incubator. Finally Lot 3, originally containing 130 eggs,

was subjected throughout the twenty-one days of incubation to the

daily dosage of alcohol fumes. At hatching, all the normial chicks

from both incubators were put together in the same house and

brooder, and given throughout life the same treatment as to food,

etc. Careful account was kept of mortality, each chick being marked

so that it could be told from which lot it came. The conditions of

brooding were purposely made bad so as to obtain a maximum

severity of post-embryonic environmental conditions with a conse-

quent high absolute mortality rate.

The result was that the more alcohol the embryos received

during incubation the higher was the prenatal mortality, but until

the dosage
Lot 3, the

became so prolonged as
prenatal mortality was

to injure selective,

all the zygotes, as in since the higher the

prenatal death rate the lower was the postnatal mortality among the

hatched chicks.

Immediately after the publication of my results, Danforth,7 in

the spring of 1917, began experiments, which were not finally

published until 1919, to see whether the selective action of alcohol

upon the germ cells which I had shown in respect of characteristics

dependent upon general vigor, also obtained in respect of morphologic

characteristics known to follow the Mendelian scheme of inheritance.

during the periods of alcohol treatment will be referred to as A, those from eggs laid in the control periods as C. Each experiment, therefore has an A and a C subdivision. In experiments, 1, 2, and 3 the heterozygous individuals were males, in 4 they were females.
" The characteristics tested for their possible response to alcohol vapor were brachydactyly, polydactyly, and color."
The alcohol was administered by the inhalation method, as by Stockard and Pearl.
The results, which are analyzed and presented in detail with the most meticulous care, can be given here only in briefest form. Table V, which is Danforth's Table IV, summarises the data.

From these data Danforth concluded that there was definitely a selective action in respect of brachydactyly. By treating a heterozygous parent with alcohol vapor of sufficient strength the proportion of brachydactyl to normal offspring can be increased. For the other two characters studied the evidence is less probative, but indicates some selective action.
I think we are entitled to conclude from the large body of critical experimental evidence provided by Danforth and Pearl that, in the fowl certainly, alcohol can and does act as a selective agent, primarily upon the germ cells, and also can be made so to act in some degree upon the developing zygotes. But since, of course, in the fowl the zygotes normally undergo all but the earliest stages of their embryonic development outside the body of the mother, it follows
that any selective action on the offspring of alcohol administered to the parents in this form must normally be mainly, if not entirely, germ cell selection.

20 EUGENICS REVIEW.
We return now to Stockard. In 1918 (loc. cit. (A) ) he published with Papanicolaou a long paper bringing his results up to date and discussing Pearl's work which had in the meantime appeared. In this paper he accepts Pearl's results in all essenitial particulars, and for the first time in his writings upon the subject, so far as I have been able to find, definitely admits that in the guinea pig alcohol acts in part as a selective destroyer of unfit and weak germ cells. He says (loc. cit. pp. 221-223):
" It see-ns to us in keeping with what is knowni of biological reactions in general and the guinea pig histories in particular to take the following position. The alcohol treatmen-t acts on the germ cell population of both fowls andl guinea pigs in such a manner that the weakest or least resistaint ova and spermatozoa die from the effects of the treatment as (germ cells without taking
part in zygote formation. The somewhat more resistant ova anid sreimatozoa arc ggreatly injured though still capable of forming zygotes. The zygotes,
however, are so defective as to be capable of oiily a short period of developmenit and die duiringa stages too early to be definitelv detecte(d by gross examinations of either the fowl's egg or the mammalian mother. Still other eimibryos arc capable of dev elopmient to later stages and are actually found dead, not only (as the youngest embryos to be identified, but from these early stages there occurs a conjtiniuous series of prenatal deaths up to the full-term of still-births. Imme(liately after birth the post-natal mortalitv is greatest anid gaomt-dually (lecreases utntil those specimens capable of reaching maturity ofteni enjoy a comparatively long life.
" At the presenit stage of the two experim-lents it would seem as though this elimination of defective germ cells and( very early embryos was much more intense in the fowls than in the guiniea pigs as a group; so that the late preniatal anid postnatal mortality amonig the fowl progeny was low and those
speceimens that hatched were the hardy survivors from this early vigorous process of gerni cell anad indivi(iual selection. The recorcds from the (10loble
alcoholic and male treated lines among the guinea pigs forms a second step. The size of the litters and failures to conceive in these lines indicates a rather high (deg,ree of infertility or germ cell (lebility as well as early prenatal deaths, tlhoilgh tihis is Inot so extrenie las amnong fowls, anid( the late prenatal and postn.atal inortality is higlher.
"F1'iin.ally the female treated guinea pig linles produce large litters and lhave few infertile mnatings, inidicating a low germ cell and early prenatal mortality, anid here the late prenatal and postlnatal mortality is higlest, not enltirely ont Caccount of the action of the treatmen-t on the developing inidividual in titero sinec the same coniditioIn is found among other female generations than the onie diree-fly treated.
" This presentation of the situation is somiiewhat similar to that which Pearl (A) has illutstrated in his diagrams, figures 5 to 7, pages 290 and 291. Th1le chief (lifference being thtat we would decrease the proportion of eliminated germl- cells anid increase the )roportion of defective and non-viable zygotes, andl thus emphasize the selectioni of inldividutals rather than of gerin cells."..
With this interpretation I am in entire agreement. It should be noted none of the evidence so far presented gives any indication, let alone proof, that alcohol produced any permanent, specific alteration of the germ plasm determiners or genes, as would be demanded bv any supposition that an acquired character had becn inherited. W\lith this view Stockard (C) is in agreement.
In 1922, and subsequently, Stockard ( (B), (C) ) presented an
analysis of his accumulated data strongly emphasizing the essentially
selective action of alcohol in improving the racial characteristics of his guinea pig stock over the long period of the experiments. Table VI gives the latest summary of his results.

Regarding these data Stockard (loc. cit. (B) p. 257) says

"Section I. contains data from the control or normal lines. These ani-

mals are of and parents

the and

sofafmseprbilngooadreliinnetshaesttwhoegarlocuophso,liacndstaocctku-alblryotihnecrasseasntllh4eifsstaemres

individuals have first been used in the control and later in the experimental

groups. There can be no doubt that any original defect or weakness that may

have been in the stock from which the alcoholic animals were derived must

also have been in the control stock, since the stocks are in all cases actually

the same. All records in the present tables are of pedigree animals from

thoroughly known blood lines and relationships. There is no inbreeding in

either the control or alcoholic lines . It is as certain as experimental evidence

can be that any difference between the records of the control and the treated

groups must be attributed to the action of the alcoholic treatment, since this

is the only element of difference existing in the life histories or experiences of

the two groups of guinea pigs.

"The records for the control show that the stock is strong and well. The

average litter of the young is about three, and the average litter weight is

188-85 grams at birth - The data from 500 control individuals show a total

mortality before reaching maturity of only 22-72 per. cent. One familiar

with breeding guinea pigs will recognize this as a very good record, far better

than usual . In the last two columns of the table the total mortality has been

divided into pre-natal and post-natal deaths - The absorbed embryos, pre-

mature births or absorptions, and stillborn young make up 58-91 per cent. or

about half of the total mortality. The post-natal mortality, under three

THE RACIAL EFFECT OF ALCOHOL.

28

months of age, was 46 per cent. of the total. This equal division of prenatal and early post-natal mortality is the normal expectation for these animals. But section II. of the table shows that in the alcoholic generations the pre-natal is double the post-natal mortality, and among the F, animals in Section III. the pre-natal mortality is more than two and a half times greater than the post-natal.
" Table 6 shows the size of litter in which the individuals occur. This is important, since animals born in large litters are at a disadvantage as compared with those born in small litters. The control section, for example, indicates that animals born in litters of two have a total mortality of only 17 - 5 per cent. while those born in litters of four suffer a mortality almost twice as high, or 33-3 per cent. The average litter size in the alcoholic group is smaller than among the control. This fact actually benefits their records and the mortality readings are corrected for the differences in litter size in the total mortality line of the table.
" Considering the successive generations it is seen that the offspring from directly treated parents present the poorest record of all. Almost 48 per cent. of their young are lost before maturity, and actually 70 8 Per cent. of these are either absorbed as early embryos, aborted prematurelv, or are stillborn. When these FI animals occur in small litters their chances for survival are greatly improved, so that of those occurring two in a litter only 28 - 5 per cent. died, but of those in litters of four 73 per cent. died. This fact conveys an idea of the great advantage possessed by members of the small litters. These are virtually partial litters the hardy survivors of an originally larger litter. When the records of the F, animals are corrected for litter size their mortality is about double that of the control.
"Many of these Fi animals are defective and many are sterile; thus only the best of them are available to give rise to the following generations. Yet in spite of this partial elimination of the defectives enough effect has been produced by the alcohol treatment on all individuals to cause the grandchildren to show an unfavourable record. When the records of the 747 animals of Section IV are compared with the control section the influence of the alcohol treatment is seen to be transmitted by the F, generation, although they had not been directly treated. The grandchildren of treated grandparents, the F, group, show a typical record closely comparable with that of the offspring from directly treated animals. The pre-natal mortality is here almost twice as high as the post-natal, and the total mortality is here almost twice as high as the post-natal, and the total mortality is 64 per cent. greater than among the control.
" Again, among the F2 animals there are defective and sterile specimens. Thus another individual elimination and selection occurs in this generation and only the most vigorous individuals of the group are left to breed. These more vigorous specimens are in many cases mated with normal stock, so that the records of animals descended from treated great-grandparents are sc mc hat improved, yet the litter size is small and the mortality record for 287 such animals is 40 per cent. higher than among the control.
" Finally, the constant elimination of the defective individuals through three generations and the matings with normal stock give animals descended from alcoholized great-great-grandparents which are superior in their records to the normal control animals. They are born in smaller litters than the control, but even when this is taken into account their mortality is actually only 64 per cent. of that of the control animals. Such animals actually have a total mortality before the age of maturity of only 13 - 5 per cent.
" The fact that F4 animals from alcoholic ancestry are superior in record to the control is a point of actuial significance. There can be no doubt that the offspring from treated parents are decidedly inferior as compared with the control; and further, that their offspring, or the progeny from treated grandparents, are also evidently inferior, but (luring these generations an individual selection is taking place through the elimination from the race of the defective and sterile specimens. This selection finally brings out a group of unusually strong specimens from which all the weaklings have been eliminated, and although they are not quite so productive as the control, their offspring show a record superior in vitality.
" Should one desire to apply these experimental results to the human

It thus appears that when completely analyzed Stockard's long and painstaking experiments on guinea pigs are fully in accord with those of Pearl on fowls, in respect of the racially beneficial ejJect of the selection which accompanies the continued administration of alcohol. Such differences as there are in the two cases in regard to the proportion of defective, but still in sonie degree viable individuals, probably are due mainly to two factors. One of these factors is probably a basic, inherent difference in response to alcohol of guinea pig protoplasm as compared with fowl protoplasm ; the other is probably found in the fact that the guinea pig undergoes its emnbryonic development inside the body of the mother, and the fowl
outside.

In neither of these recent papers of Stockard's in which he has
so strongly and rightly emphasized the racial benefit derived from
the selective action of alcohol does he give the slightest reference or suggestion that he is not the first investigator to show, or even to suggest, that alcohol had a selective action. The earlier work is
neglected, no doubt unintentionally, but still completely, and the. reader ignorant of the history of the subject is left to draw the
conclusion that Stockard is the pioneer in showing a racially bene-
ficial action of alcohol through selection.8 But as has been set forth
in this paper, Pearl first presented experimental evidence for such a selective action in 1916, both in respect of germ cells and developing zygotes, for characters representing general vigor, anid Danforth in
1919 for specific Mendelian unit characters. An experimental study of the racial effect of continued admini-
stration of alcohol was begun in 1920 by Hanson,9 using the albino rat as material. As in the work of Stockard, Pearl and Danforth,
the alcohol was administered by inhalation. The characters so far
published upon are chiefly body weight, bodv length and tail length.
The work has been reported for four generations. The tentative conclusion so far reached is stated in the following words after a resume of the results of Pearl and Danforth (loc. cit. pp. 805-306).

"A germinal selection is probably also in progress in this work. This

is evidenced by the fact that while in the early generations the amount of

sterility was very great, at times endangering the continuance of the experi-
ment, in the last two generations the fertility has been completely restored, and now equals, if not surpasses, that of the controls.X"'

Hanson is cautious in drawing any conclusions and emphasises
the necessity of many successive generations. In regard to any
influence of alcohol upon the sex ratio he finds that there is no such
influence in the rat, confirming Pearl's conclusion to the same effect for the fowl, and shows by a proper biometric analysis of Stockard's data that it had no significant effect on the sex ratio in the guinea pig.
We must next consider the contributions of MacDowell.'0 Their

consideration has been deferred to this point, which brings the work slightly out of chronological order, because MacDowell has in the main dealt with an entirely different sort of character than any of the
investigators previously mentioned. Indeed, the only prior experi-
mental student of MacDowell's main problem was Arlitt," wlhose
work, however interesting to the psychologist, does not contribute either extensively or critically to the genetic problem in which we
are here interested. MacDowell has concentrated upon the influence
of alcohol (administered by inhalation) upon the behaviour of white
rats and their descendants. Somewhat incidentally, as will appear, he has collected valuable information upon other characteristics,
notably fertility and growth. Considering first the behaviour results, which had to do with the
acquirement on the part of the rats of abilitv to go through a maze.
The final conclusions of the last paper (E), which are consonant with and in part based upon the results of the first (A), arc:

small numbers involved is either on or below the border-line of statistical significance.
"A small but consistent modification of the maze behaviour of the untreated offspring from treated parents was found; this appeared more clearly
in the criteria from perfect trials than in the time per trial.
"Seveni rats from a normal pair did not appear to differ in their maze behaviour from five rats from the same mother and a treated father.
" Untreated rats from parents treated with mild doses did not show any difference in their maze behaviour from their controls.
" Considering the evidence in this and the first paper in this series the following generalization is reached: Alcoholism in ancestors may modify the behaviour of untreated descendants."
One cannot refrain from remarking that this final generalization is one which might have been reached by an intrepid reasoner even in advance of any experimentation whatever. MacDowell has in truth
performed a. veritable mountain of laborious experiment to bring
forth such a tiny mouse of cautious conclusion. The detached and
disinterested reader of the paper on this phase of the subject is sure, I think, to conclude that while he ought in decency to feel in some
degree awed by the magnitude of the labour spent, nevertheless, the net result is that alcoholization of ancestors produces no very definite or marked alteration in the behaviour of progeny. If there is any residual effect it must be almost infinitesimally slight. Certainly it would be difficult to make a convincing bogey-man of alcohol as a "racial poison" on the strength of MacDowell's behaviour results.
It seems to me that the by-products of his work, the data on fertility and growth, contribute rather more of value to the problem of the racial influence of alcohol than do the behaviour results, chiefly because they are more definite.
Taking fertility first, Tables VII and VIII give MacDowell's data on litter size and litter number respectively (loc. cit. (B) p. 126 and p. 181).

His conclusions are:-
" The treatment of white rats with alcohol by the inhalation method tends to reduce the size of litters. A reduction in the neighbourhood of la per cent. of the respective controls appears when the daily dose was small and when it was maximum, in the litters from treated rats as well as in rats whose parents or grandparents were treated. The numbers are not large enouah to make this reduction statisticallv significant when each generation is considered by itself, but when all the generations are taken together, the difference between the test and control averages is significant.
" Given daily in maximum doses alcohol reduces the number of litters produced by the treated rats. Judging by the number of litters produced by their controls, this reduction is in the neighbourhood of 65 per cent. The treatment of rats from treated parents made a smaller reduction (35 per cent.) in the number of litters than when the treatment was confined to one generation. In contrast to this, rats whose parents or grandparents alone were treated produced from a third to a half as many again as the controls.
"*These conclusions may be interpreted as due, first, to an inherited modification that reduces the size of litters, and second, to the selective elimination of germ-plasm bearing factors detrimental to litter production through the immediate reaction of alcohol upon the treated rats. Thus alcohol appears to modify fertility in two different ways, each working independently, and, in the generations after the first, in opposite directions. I m
" In so far as these results show a reduction in the total output, they agree with those of Stockard on guinea pigs and Pearl on fowl. Further than this the per cent. reduction in litter size in the different generations is closely alike for rats and guinea pigs, while the results given by the numbers of litters agree with those of Pearl in showing immediate reduction in numbers, followed by a superiority in the survivors."
Regarding growth MacDowell's data are presented in Table IX
(from (C) p. 806, where the mnaterial is given in better form than
in the original paper (D) devoted to this topic).
MacDowell points out that these results are very similar to those on fertility, and goes on to say:
"Just as the offspring of the treated rats appear to be genetically superior to the controls in the matter of litter production, so they are found to be q superior in the matter of weight, with the result that when they themselves are treated, the immediate re(lucing effect of the alcohol makes them about equal somatically to their controls, instead of growing markedly slower as did their parents. This likeness in results leads to a similar interpretation forthe weight as for the number of litters: the alcohol has acted as a selectiveagent, elitninating germinal material that included factors for slower growth.

We may now briefly consider the results of some of the less extensive pieces of experimental work on the subject.

with food, and later by inhalation, his results on growth are summarised as follows: " Although the young of the alcohol mice when given alcohol themselves excelled all the other mice in growth, other young of these same mice when not given alcohol grew even faster." In other words the non-alcoholized progeny of alcoholized parents n'ade the best growth records. This same result was got by Pearl with chicks. Furthermore, Nice's data are such as to indicate that the result is due to a selective action of the alcohol.
Bluhm13 performed experiments with white mice on the alteration of the normal sex ratio by the administration of alcohol to the nmale parent. A preliminary experiment on 195 complete normal litters containing 965 young gave a sex ratio of 79.36 d' : 100 ?. Alcoholization was produced by injecting a solution of ethyl alcohol subcutaneously. Only male parents were injected. Sixty-seven alcoholic litters gave a sex ratio of 122.14 &: 100 ? . She concludes that this result may be explained on the assumption that there are two sorts of spermatozoa, male determiners and female determiners, and that the motility of the latter sort is more diminished by the alcoholization than that of the former. The work seems carefully done, but should be repeated because so far out of line with other extensive experiments by Hanson, Stockard, and Pearl (cf. supra.)
Bilski'4 experimented with the frog (Rana lusca). The individuals were alcoholized by immersions in solutions of alcohol of
different strength and for different lengths of time. The spawn of
a female was divided and fertilized with the sperrrm of non-alcoholized
males and of males alcoholized in varying degrees ; and conversely the sperm cells of males were made to fertilize ova of females alcoholized in differing degrees. From the combination of single pairs and the comparison of their offspring, it was thought possible
partly to eliminate the individual differences in the parents, so that the effect of the alcohol alone was left. His concluisions are that alcohol causes premature ovulation in the frog. No typical defects could be found in the offspring or even the most heavily alcholized parents. More eggs developed from slightly alcoholized parents than from unalcoholized control parents. There was, however, usually an increased mortality in those broods, so that the number of offspring finally equalled or fell below the number in control broods. Bilski thinks that moderate alcoholization of parents has a stimulating effect upon eggs and sperm, and hence brings about the development of zygotes from weak germ cells which normally would never start development. Later these zygotes are eliminated by
natural selection.

We now briefly summarize the whole case to date. By way of preliminary it should be noted that throughout this review I have followed the plan of directly quoting the several workers. This was

done to forestall any possibility of the charge being made that I had read into their data different interpretations to what they themselves held.
I think that the following general conclusions may fairly be drawn as summarizing to date the important net results of the considerable body of careful, painstaking research which had been done upon the problem.
1. The racial effect of alcohol is preponderantly either beneficial, or at the worst, not harmful. This is true for characters depending upon general vigor in guinea pigs (after early generations are passed) fowls, rats, mice, and probably frogs.
2. This beneficial racial effect appears to be the resuilt primarily of the fact that alcohol acts as a definite, but not too drastic selective agent, both upon germ cells and developing zygotes, eliminating. the weak and leaving the strong.
8. The only racial effects of alcohol which can possibly be regarded as harmful which have yet been brought to light by this mass of experimental work are
(a). The production of defective offspring in earlv generations by alcoholized guinea pigs (Stockard). This result is peculiar to the guinea pig. No such effect has been noted in any other animal: either the fowl (Pearl, Danforth) ; rat (MacDowel], Hanson); mouse (Nice, Bluhm); or frog (Bilski). These findings suggest that the guinea pig is somewhat peculiar in its reactions to alcohol. There can be no shadow of a doubt as to the accuracy of Stockard's findings regarding that animal.
(b). A possible slight reduction in activity and ability to learn of the offspring of white rats (MacDowell).
(c). A reduction in fertility following the administration of alcohol. But as this marks one element of a selective process which ultimately is beneficial to the race, it is questionable whether it should be reckoned a racially harmful effect at all.
Any application of these experimental results to man should be ,cautiously made, for the following reasons, among others:-
The dosage of alcohol is in general much larger in the exper-mental work with animals than any consumption of alcohol by human beings.
The alcohol is administered in most of the experiments by inhalation, a process which has some very different physiological effects than drinking alcohol in solution.
The guinea pig case shows that some organisms may be quite differently affected racially, for a time at least, by alcohol, than are otbers. The conclusions drawn from one organism cannot safely be transferred to another in this case.
But regardless of any immediate application to man, it is an extremely satisfactory thing to have such a large body of critical experimental results, so consistently agreeing in regard to their main, broad conclusions. That much more work needs to be done in this field goes without saying, but the experimenter who begins now has a definite and consistent body of solidlv grounded knowledge to start
from, instead of the indefinite conjectures of fifteen years ago.
