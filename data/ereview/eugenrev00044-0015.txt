HOME BACKGROUND AND, SELECTION FOR SECONDARY EDUCATION*
By F. M. MARTIN, PH.D.

T HE year I902 saw the establishment in this country of a public system of secondary education. The principal
basis of the new system was provided by the old endowed grammar schools, and its aims and methods were heavily influenced by those of the public schools. For nearly half a century thereafter, " equality of educational opportunity" was generally to be taken to mean that access to the secondary schools should be available to children of the requisite ability without regard to social origins or parental means. Competition for secondary school places was always severe, not primarily as a consequence of any widespread public appreciation of the scholarly virtues of the secondary tradition, but rather because of a keen awareness on the part of the parents of the social value of a secondary education. The expanding occupations of the " new " middle class were the main goal of those many parents who hoped to see their children settled in employment which, if not highly remunerative, did at least offer a measure of security, and to these the secondary school seemed to provide the only direct route.
Education and Social Mobility
Recent research has shown clearly that the parents who attached so much importance to a grammar school education, and were in so many cases prepared to make substantial financial sacrifices rather than send their children to, say, the junior technical school, had in fact an accurate sense of the distribution of occupational opportunity. It has been clearly demonstrated' that occupational prospects were, in the years between

the wars, extremely closely linked to success or failure in acquiring a secondary school education. For the working-class child it provided the most reliable means of upward social mobility, while the middle-class child, if he did not improve his occupational level relative to that of his father, at least acquired
a substantial measure of immunity against the risk of social relegation. Further educa-
tion reinforced the effects of secondary education but did not provide a substitute
for it. In spite of a steadily growing provision of
secondary school places and of the increasing proportion of such places available to competition, it became obvious fairly early in the development of the public secondary
system that a child's chances of reaching a secondary school varied substantially according to his social origins. Marked differences in examination results between elementary
schools of varying social composition were frequently commented upon by H.M. Inspectors between I922 and I939. It was shown,
too, that these social class differences were not a mere reflection of differences in intellectual composition. Kenneth Lindsay2
pointed out that working-class parents not infrequently refused to accept secondary school places which had been offered to their children; John Gray and Pearl Moshinsky3 showed that many middle-class children who attended secondary schools fell below a postulated minimum level of ability, while by the same criterion the lower social groups were grossly under-represented; Leybourne and White4 assessed the direct and indirect cost to parents of a secondary school education; and Ruth Glass5 indicated the existence of a high correlation between the success rates of elementary schools and the
level of their material environment.

I96 THE EUGENICS REVIEW

The Aims of this Inquiry.
The present inquiry, although it followed directly from the national investigations reportea in Social Mobility in Britain, also has affinities with these earlier studies. It was carried out by a group of research workers, whose senior member was Mrs. Jean Floud, and was generously supported by the London School of Economics and Political Science. It took the form of a pair of local studies whose immediate aim was to illustrate the social and cultural factors at work in the process of selection for secondary education and their influence on the subsequent achievements of children both in school and on leaving. It attempted also to assess the effect on the distribution of educational opportunity of post-war legislation and social change, by measuring the extent to which the social composition of the secondary schools had changed over time, and the degree in which, if at all, children of the requisite level of intellectual ability were still effectively denied access to the grammar
-schools as a consequence of their social
origins. That " educational opportunity" was defined in terms of access to the secondary grammar schools, and " ability" in terms of intelligence test performance, does not imply any lack of realization of the limitations of such an approach, and I hope to comment on some of these limitations at a later stage. Its justification was the need to document the extent of the post-war educational revolution in the terms in which reform had been demanded in the pre-war years.
Areas Studied
The two areas selected for study were Middlesbrough, in the North Riding of Yorkshire, and the Educational Division of South-West Hertfordshire,* which in terms both of social structure and of educational provision may be regarded as reasonably representative of conditions in the north and

south of England respectively. Our information as to the social origins of secondary school entrants was obtained, as far as pre-war years were concerned, from school admission registers; by direct inquiry in writing of the parents of children now in attendance at the grammar schools; and by interviewt with the parents of children who at the time of our inquiry were in their last year at a primary school or its equivalent, and were candidates for selection for secondary education. Both the second and third method of inquiry produced information relating to a wide range of features of the child's family environment, and I shall discuss some of the results of the interviews in rather more detail.
The two districts differ markedly from one another in their social composition and their industrial structure. The general pattern of social class differences is clearly indicated by the Report of the I95I Census.

In Middlesbrough, with its dependence on

heavy industry, the great majority of the

population are manual workers, a high

proportion of them unskilled or general

labourers. Although at present enjoying full

employment and a fair measure of prosperity,

Middlesbrough has vivid memories of large-

scale distress and unemployment in the

years between the wars. Its population,

geographically relatively stable, includes a

substantial Catholic minority. In South-

West Hertfordshire, by contrast, the non-

manual occupations are rather better repre-

sented than in the country as a whole. Its

manual working class, in which skilled

workers easily predominate, is diverse in its

recent geographical origins and it has a trend

of steady economic expansion as a back-

ground to its present prosperity.

t In Middlesbrough a 50 per cent sample of parents was taken; in South-West Hertfordshire the parents of
the entire age-group were approached.

HOME BACKGROUND AND SELECTION FOR SECONDARY EDUCATION I97

Provision for secondary education has
developed on rather different lines in the two areas. In the Watford Grammar Schools, the proportion of places available to competition never exceeded one-third before the passage of the I944 Education Act; the corresponding proportion in Middlesbrough was threequarters. The Watford Grammar Schools were therefore to a much greater extent the preserve of the middle and lower middle classes, and the impact of the Education Act was substantially greater. However, in both areas the abolition of fees in I945 led to a marked increase in the representation of working-class children in the grammar schools; but even under conditions of full competition the chances of gaining access to a grammar school vary considerably from one social class to another. This is clearly indicated by the social. analysis of examination results shown in Table i.

50 per cent sample.
Primarily as a result of the larger provision of grammar school places, the success rate of manual workers' children is higher in South-West Hertfordshire, where just over one in seven of the working-class children reaches the grammar school, than in Middlesbrough, where the corresponding proportion is slightly less than one in eight. The chances of working-class children in SouthWest Hertfordshire are probably also increased to a slight extent by the incomplete participation in the entrance examination of the children of business and professional people, who are more likely than in

Middlesbrough to send their children to independent schools.: Even in South-West Hertfordshire, however, a steep social gradient is perceptible; the son of parents in the professional and managerial groups having almost exactly three times as great a chance of reaching a grammar school as the son of a skilled manual worker, and four times the chance of the son of an unskilled worker. The Middlesbrough gradient is steeper, with the corresponding proportions standing at five to one and seven and a half to one respectively. The children of the lower middle-class groups occupy intermediate positions, with success rates that are very similar in the two areas. About one-quarter of the sons of supervisors and small tradesmen reach the grammar school, and just over one-third of the sons of clerks.
Social Distribution of Ability
To the extent that access to the grammar school is primarily dependent in the first instance upon some form of examination performance, it is clearly unrealistic to divorce a discussion of differential class chances from some consideration of the social distribution of ability. Earlier critics of the then inequalities of educational opportunity in this country were mainly concerned with the gross discrepancies between the proportion of children in each social class who by their performance in intelligence tests gave evidence of a certain level of intellectual capacity and the proportion who enjoyed- the benefits of secondary education; they made no attempt to minimize the substantial differences in measured intelligence between social classes. We tried therefore to ascertain whether ability and opportunity, as thus defined, stand in a closer relationship to-day than in the I930S. Within the areas in which our investigation was carried out our sources of information were very limited as far as pre-war years are concerned, but left little doubt that many able children of working-class origin lacked opportunity in the period before I944. This was particularly marked in South-West Hertfordshire, but applied also in Middles-

surprised to learn that in both districts size of family was related to success in the selection examination. On closer study, however, the relationship appears to be fairly complex, and not one that would justify a simple explanation. In the first

Tables 2, 3 and 4 show how a number of --individual factors are each related to examination performance, but do not give sufficient indication of their relative strength. We were interested to know what happened when parents had marked educational ambitions

circumstances, and what happened when they were comfortably off but educationally Philistine. This part of the analysis was

the group of children from homes rated " wholly favourable " (2I per cent). It is evident that the material environment of the home is not a significant influence on success in South-West Hertfordshire, where it is not merely less varied than in Middlesbrough but of a better standard at all social levels.
Intelligence Tests
These findings have, I think, widespread implications, social, educational and psychological, and few of them can be pursued in the brief time available. I should like, however, to comment on one problem that arises from the study, namely the interpretation of the strong positive relationships between examination performance (which includes intelligence test performance) and these various aspects of home background, relationships which still hold good when occupational class is held constant. There is a simple explanation which is bound to be suggested-that these indices of home background which are prognostic of good examination performance are merely reflections of superior intelligence in the parents, which will have been genetically transmitted. to their children. I do not for a moment doubt that there are substantial elements of truth in this theory, but if it is put forward as a complete explanation I would suggest that it over-simplifies the problem and is indeed intrinsically lacking in plausibility, since some of the most significant features of home backgroundin this respect are essentially to be classified as motivational in character, and as having only a limited association with intelligence.
Many of the earlier writers on intelligence testing argued that these tests measured a genetically determined innate capacity. Convincing evidence in support of such an extreme theory has never been adduced; at the same time, it has never been possible to substantiate empirically the equally extreme view of differences in measured intelligence as the product merely of variations in the social and cultural environment, immune to genetic influences.
The relationship between the sets of causal factors is clearly one of interaction;

environment is not simply superimposed
upon heredity in such a way that it would be
possible to conceive of intelligence as the sum
of the two components. Nevertheless, it may
be useful to make a distinction as Hebb6-
whose starting point was in the study of brain lesions-has proposed, between what
he calls Intelligence A and Intelligence B. By
Intelligence A he refers to an innate intellec-
tual capacity whose existence can only be
postulated, and which cannot be observed or measured, while Intelligence B refers to the complex product which is employed in human behaviour and which can be assessed
by means of tests. The transition from
Intelligence A to Intelligence B involves a series of learning experiences-using the term in the widest possible sense-and some of the conditions of learning will vary not merely idiosyncratically but to some extent
systematically as between different social groups and categories. In short, although I do not wish to suggest that the crude indices of home background that we have employed can be regarded as social determinants of intelligence, I do think that they indicate the type of influences which among others might be worth analysing more closely, should a serious examination of social and cultural influences in the development of intelligence ever be seriously undertaken. This comment by no means invalidates the use of intelligence tests for selection purposes, where the aim is to assess educability in the restricted sense of capacity to profit from education within secondary schools as at present organized, and where the question of origin is largely irreleva-nt. From this admittedly limited point of view the intelligence test provides an instrument of prediction which is administratively convenient, statistically reliable and reasonably, though imperfectly, valid.
