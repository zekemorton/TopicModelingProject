The importance of the inquiry is this: It appears probable that the intelligence of the nation is declining, but there is little or no direct evidence in this country of how many children people of high intelligence have. In America, it has been found that both Princeton graduates and Terman's group of I,ooo specially gifted children have many fewer offspring than are needed for replacement. (i, 9) Here, in ex-pupils of Winchester College I have a sample of high intelligence and I have found out how many children they have.

the number of children of Old Wykehamists, the proportion of bachelors, and the average age of marriage. This is, of course, the most
important section: the point of the earlier
sections is to merely show the nature of the
sample of the population chosen for this inquiry.
Finally, a short discussion of the significance of the results, showing how far this sample of high intelligence is succeeding in replacing itself.

results of the intelligence tests for any individual are confidential and are available

3.-TIe Significance of Intelligence Quotients

2.-The Constancy of the Intelligence of
the Wykehamical Population This is the least satisfactory section of my paper because of the difficulty of obtaining adequate evidence. But unless I can make it seem probable that Wykehamists of the I9I6 vintage were also in the most intelligent half of the population, then the number of children they have produced is irrelevant,

In spite of scepticism among some parents and teachers, I think it well established that the I.Q. is fairly constant and decidedly useful (I exclude such phenomena as "I.Q.s" after " coaching "(io)). Some of my results are as follows:

a stamped addressed envelope for reply;
nine days later 50 per cent had replied; ten weeks later 88 per cent had replied and information had been obtained about another 7 per cent; evidently the method was prac-
ticable. There was in this " pilot " sample
a noticeable but not statistically significant
difference between the number of children
of scholars and of commoners, and so the size of the sample was enlarged by sending
out 44I further questionnaires at the end of July, sampling all commoners now living who entered the school in the years I9I6-20

I should like to analyse these results under
the headings of (a) adult mortality, (b) proportion replying-directly or indirectly, (c) proportion marrying, (d) age at marriage,
(e) size of family, (f) distribution of family sizes, (g) child mortality, and then to sum up.
(a) Adult mortality. Of the scholars of the I906-I0 group, one-third were killed in
World War I, and it is evident that the remainder are rather exceptional in that many more have died, fewer have married and the family size is smaller. Of the I94 scholars entering in I9II-25, i.e. the other
three groups, I79 survived, i.e. 92-3 per
cent; and of the 4I6 commoners entering in i9i6-20, 37I survived, i.e. 89-I per cent.

scholars marry later than the general population(I7) as would be expected, i.e. at over
30 instead of at 271, the difference being
highly significant.
What is encouraging, and a little unexpected, is the tendency of scholars in recent years to marry younger, the difference of I*9 years between the I906-I5 groups and the I9I6-25 groups being statistically signi-
ficant (t =23). (e) Size of family. For commoners the
family size of 21I2 live-births per married couple is exactly the same as for women married eighteen years ago (in I934) in the
population as a whole (I934 is the median
year of marriage for this group).
It is interesting to calculate the effect of
families being incomplete. Six per cent of those replying hoped to have more children;

2-IO children for the I92I-25 group will rise to 2'40. It should be noted that identically
the same result is obtained by the two different methods of making allowances:
either by assuming that each hopeful parent will have one more child, or by assuming that an average of 0-3 more children will be born to each woman married in I939. If their allowances are accepted, the conclusion
is most encouraging: that there is a definite tendency in this most intelligent group in
the sample for family sizes to increase during this 20-year period, and that the size of
completed families of the I92I-25 group should be enough to ensure replacement, after allowing for bachelors and for mortality.
(f) Distribution of family sizes. Table IX shows proportions of families with a given

if they succeed in having one more each, the size will be 21i9. This is the same as the figure of 2*i9 for women in Great Britain married in I929 or earlier, i.e. those who appear to have completed their families. Thus, the family size of commoners in the sample is-although inadequate for replacement-no worse than for the population as a whole.
For scholars in the sample the results are very interesting:
If allowance is made for incomplete families the figure of 2.I7 children for the I9I6-20 group will rise to 2-24, and that of

number of children. Three features are noticeable: (a) more Wykehamists tend to have families of two, three or four children;

whole, and 27 per I,ooo for the well-to-do. The child mortality of commoners is thus characteristic of the well-to-do.
(h) Summary of inquiry. The results of this inquiry are summarized in Table X.
Discussion of Results. I have, I hope, shown that-judged by intelligence tests -Wykehamists are a highly intelligent section of the community, and that Winchester Scholars are extremely so, and it is probable that this was equally true thirty years ago; that a sample of over 500 Wykehamists have slightly fewer children than the population as a whole, 85 per cent replacement instead of go per cent, because of the lower marriage rates ; i.e. there is only slight evidence of a differential birth-rate with respect to intelligence; the most encouraging sign is that among the scholars
-who cover a 2o-year range-therq is evi-
dence of a steady increase in family size so that it may be expected that the I921-25 group (i.e. those born in I908-I3) will have not merely more children than the average of the population but even just enough for replacement. Perhaps in ten years' time someone may repeat this inquiry with a later group of both commoners and scholars and see if this optimism is justified.
Finally, I hope I have made it clear that this research has been very much of a
co-operative undertaking, and many of my friends and helpers have already been

thanked in this paper. A large number of other friends and colleagues have assisted by giving ideas and by administering tests, and
my wife in correcting tests and discussing
the results; 492 Old Wykehamists courteously replied to an " inquisitive little circular asking for intimate details of their family planning"; twelve headmasters and three directors of education have been bothered to do extra work for me, and I should like to thank them all very much, but most especially our Secretary, Dr. Cedric Carter, who has provided the driving force and encouragement necessary to get this paperproduced.
